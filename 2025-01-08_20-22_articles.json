                "content": "• Tens of thousands of people have been told to evacuate as a fast-growing fire destroys homes in the Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles. Many were forced to abandon cars in the seaside neighborhood sandwiched between Malibu and Santa Monica, which have also issued evacuation orders. With traffic slowing evacuations, and flames jumping the highway, some considered sheltering on the beach. • The out-of-control Palisades fire is blazing through about five football fields a minute and has burned more than 2,900 acres. Los Angeles has declared an emergency and officials warned that the worst is yet to come as “tornado-like” winds complicate firefighters’ battles. • Two other fires have erupted in Los Angeles County: The 100-acre strong Hurst fire north of San Fernando, and the Eaton fire in Altadena, which has grown to 1,000 acres in a matter of hours. At a Pasadena senior care home, workers raced to evacuate residents with the Eaton blaze just a block away. More than 200,000 homes and buildings are without power in the county. Our live coverage of the Los Angeles County wildfires has moved here. All residents in Malibu not under evacuation orders have been told to prepare for evacuation anyway, with the city warning that it was a “critical time to prepare for the unpredictable and rapidly changing nature of the fire.” Those who need additional time to evacuate, or who have pets or livestock, should consider preparing to leave now, the city said in an update on its website just before midnight Tuesday. It urged residents to relocate northwest toward Oxnard if they had a safe location to go outside Malibu, saying early evacuations could help avoid traffic congestion or delays if an order is later issued. Evacuees can head to these three shelters: Those with animals can head to these shelters: Drivers began abandoning their cars across Los Angeles’ main roadways early Tuesday after authorities told people to clear the roads as the Palisades fire grew closer. On Sunset Boulevard, drivers were told by fire officials to get our of their cars and escape the fast-approaching blaze by foot. The fire department later reported 30 vehicles that were abandoned on Sunset that would be bulldozed to make way for first responders, according to CNN affiliate KCAL. “The fire came right down to the road and the fire department came up and said get out of your cars now — because the fire was right up against the cars,” Marsha Horowitz, who was driving down Sunset at the time, told KCAL. “There were three lanes of cars, and the fire was right down and there was nothing to stop it.” Another driver on Sunset said that she witnessed fire all around her as fire officials approached her to leave her car. All highway lanes near Topanga Canyon Boulevard closed after the wildfire expanded to 200 acres on Tuesday morning, while part of the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu experienced a traffic gridlock before authorities told drivers to leave their cars. Adam Handler and his wife were among those trying to evacuate when they received a chilling warning from law enforcement authorities, according to CNN affiliate KNBC. “A police officer started telling us, ‘Get out of your car if you want to live,’” Handler said. Structures and vehicles are on fire in Santa Paula, in the Santa Clara River Valley between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, according to the Ventura County Fire Department. “Units on scene reporting multiple storage units and vehicles on fire,” the department posted on X just after midnight. “Firefighters from VCFD and Ventura City Fire Department are aggressively working to control this fire.” Videos posted by the department show smoke and embers flying in the strong wind, with fire crews handling multiple hoses. It was not immediately clear whether the fire was linked to the wildfires in Los Angeles County. As she evacuated from her home, Pasadena resident Bobbie Oliver sent CNN photos and videos. “The smoke was unbearable even with windows closed,” Oliver told CNN. “We could see the fire and our house was full of smoke. Then a cop car went around saying evacuate now in a bullhorn,” she added. Oliver was able to grab her two dogs, laptops and passports along with some of her father’s artwork before leaving. “It was frantic and downed trees and branches all in the streets,” she said about the evacuation. In one video she sent to CNN, police cars and strong winds can be heard. The Eaton fire, located in Altadena north of Pasadena, has rapidly grown to cover 1,000 acres – just six hours after it began burning. Like the other two blazes burning in the area – the massive Palisades fire and the newly erupted Hurst fire – the Eaton fire is at 0% containment, according to fire officials. Firefighters have been battling the blazes since Tuesday afternoon, warning earlier in the day that extreme wind conditions would only get worse overnight – with fire crews now in the thick of it, at shortly after midnight in California. There is no possibility of containing the Los Angeles fires tonight, and firefighters are focusing on saving lives instead, said David Acuna, the public information officer with CAL Fire and a battalion chief. Asked by CNN if there was “any hope of possibility of containment of these fires, given the high winds” Acuna replied: “No. Honestly, there’s not.” “We are mostly concerned with ensuring that all people get out of the area because life safety is the most important part, and we’re helping people to plan so that their pets and livestock also have a safe shelter,” he said. Acuna said strong wind meant the fires continued to expand. “The Palisades is now just shy of 3,000 acres. The Eaton fire near the Angeles National Forest is over 1,000 acres. And the Hurst fire near Sylmar is just over 100 acres. However, these are growing are because the winds are not letting up. In fact, they’re not planning to let up through all night and likely into tomorrow,” he told CNN. The Hurst fire, which began around 10:30 p.m. in the Sylmar neighborhood just above San Fernando, is “spreading rapidly under high winds, creating dangerous conditions for nearby communities,” according to state fire department CAL Fire. An evacuation order was issued for the area north of the Interstate 210, sitting just north of Sylmar, while evacuation warnings have been issued for parts of the Granada Hills North neighborhood southwest of the highway. The fire is about 100 acres big. The Eaton fire in Altadena has grown to 600 acres, according to CAL Fire, the state’s fire department – an increase from 400 acres from just three hours ago. And less than an hour before that, it was only at 100 acres, showing just how quickly the blaze has exploded. Elsewhere in LA County, the huge Palisades fire is still burning near Santa Monica, measuring more than 2,900 acres. A new, third fire has erupted north of San Fernando, with the Hurst Fire at 100 acres big. Here are the evacuation centers that have been set up so far, according to CAL Fire: California has experienced a stark contrast in weather between regions, with significantly above-average rainfall across Northern California, while some parts of Southern California haven’t seen over a quarter of an inch of rainfall since early July. A series of atmospheric rivers and atmospheric river-fueled storms have barraged Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, bringing significant precipitation. This has brought rainfall amounts to as much as 200% above normal across Northern California since October 1. The opposite is the truth for Southern California, which has seen Santa Ana wind events and below average rainfall over the past three months. On October 1, none of Los Angeles County was under drought conditions, but according to the latest drought numbers, which came out on January 1, over 83% of the county is in a moderate drought. On October 1, only 10% of the California as a whole was under any sort of drought conditions, the majority occurring across southeastern California. Fast forward to the latest drought numbers, over 30% of the state is experiencing some sort of drought conditions, with the majority of this occurring across Southern California. Little relief is in store for Southern California, with the Climate Prediction Center calling for below-average rainfall chances for the month of January. The role of climate change: Wildfires are fueled by a knot of factors, both natural and human-caused, but scientists say that global warming is loading the dice in favor of more intense and severe blazes. Hotter temperatures are the clearest climate change-fueled contributor to wildfires. Heat sucks the moisture from vegetation making it much more combustible. “Drier fuels are a critical part of fire, the drier the fuel the easier it is to start a fire,” Mike Flannigan, professor of wildland fire at the University of Alberta, told CNN in March. CNN’s Laura Paddison contributed reporting. The Pacific Palisades fire is burning at 0% containment at 2,921 acres, the Los Angeles County Fire Department wrote in a post on X late Tuesday. “Extreme fire behavior, short & long-range spotting, continues to challenge firefighting efforts for the Palisades Fire,” the post read, adding that winds gusting up to 60 mph are expected to continue through Thursday. Two videos attached to the post show fires violently searing upwards through trees, with branches charred and bare. Several celebrities have been affected by the Palisades fire, which blazed through the affluent Pacific Palisades neighborhood in the Santa Monica mountains. Actor Eugene Levy, most recently known for his role in “Schitt’s Creek,” told the Los Angeles Times that he got stuck while evacuating. “The smoke looked pretty black and intense over Temescal Canyon,” he said. “I couldn’t see any flames but the smoke was very dark.” Actor James Woods shared videos of the fire engulfing a house two doors down from him, later saying he had evacuated the area. “I do not know at this moment if our home is still standing, but sadly houses on our little street are not,” he wrote on X, adding that his family had renovated a home after the pandemic and just finished last month. Actor Steve Guttenberg helped fire crews by trying to move some abandoned cars from the road, telling CNN he’d never seen anything like it in his life. By the time he evacuated in the early evening, burning trees were falling on Sunset Boulevard, and iconic buildings like the Pierson Playhouse, part of the Theatre Palisades. Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr said his mother was forced to flee the Palisades and that team staff member Everett Dayton’s family home had been lost. “Everything I’m seeing and reading is just terrifying,” he said in a news conference shared on X. Los Angeles Lakers coach JJ Redick said that his family, his wife’s family along with her twin sister’s family have all been evacuated from the Palisades fire. “I just want to acknowledge and send thoughts and prayers to everyone in the Palisades right now,” Redick said before the Lakers’ game against the Mavericks in Dallas, the Associated Press reported. “That’s where I live.” About the neighborhood: The coastal community has long been popular among celebrities, including Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson. It’s also home to the famous Getty Villa, a museum that houses a variety of relics from Greece and Rome, which said Tuesday night it was safe from the fire. A third blaze, the Hurst fire, has erupted in the Sylmar neighborhood just northwest of San Fernando, according to CAL Fire, the state’s fire department. The fire has burned through 100 acres, with an immediate evacuation order issued for the area north of the 210 Freeway from Roxford to the Interstate 5-state Route 14 split, also known as the Newhall Pass interchange. The fire is located between the Palisades and Eaton fires, at a more northern latitude. Shelby Kidman, who was onboard a flight as it traveled over the Palisades fire, filmed the blaze from above. She told CNN the video was taken as her flight from Salt Lake City approached Los Angeles International Airport. Watch the fires raging beneath the plane: Burning through five football fields a minute, the Palisades fire has expanded rapidly over the past few hours, destroying homes and prompting evacuation warnings for tens of thousands of people, from Malibu to Santa Monica. Many were forced to abandon cars in the area that is again at the center of a large blaze following December’s Franklin fire. With traffic slowing evacuations and flames jumping the highway, some had also considered sheltering on the beach. A separate fire in Los Angeles County, the Eaton fire in Altadena, has doubled in size to 400 acres. At a Pasadena elderly care home, workers raced to get everybody out safe with Eaton fire just a block away, according to CNN affiliate KCAL. Video shows dozens of residents in wheelchairs, many wearing only thin gowns and covered in shawls on the cold night. Some didn’t even have shoes, only their socks on, in the rush to leave. Here’s what you should know: • Schools close: Five schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District will close on Wednesday, and classes are moving online. • Firefighter injured: A 25-year-old firefighter has sustained a serious head injury. She received treatment at the scene and was sent to hospital, the fire department said. • Eaton fire doubles: In the space of an hour, the Eaton fire in Altadena has exploded to 400 acres. The Angeles National Forest has urged people in the area to evacuate immediately as high winds are forecast to continue and tens of thousands also flee the Palisades fire. More than 200,000 homes and buildings are without power in the county. • Renowned buildings in flames: A beloved roadside seafood restaurant in Malibu was destroyed by the Palisades fire. The Reel Inn was 36 years old. The Palisades Charter High School, a famed set for films, and nearby elementary school were engulfed by flames. • All equipment used: California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that “hundreds and hundreds of personnel” were responding to the Palisades fire, using airplanes, helicopters, bulldozers and water tenders. The Los Angeles Fire Department is also asking off-duty members to call in to help battle the blaze. But as fire crews battle the Eaton fire north of Pasadena, their fight is limited by having grounded aircraft due to the extreme winds. • Firefighter warnings: Los Angeles County Fire Department Capt. Sheila Kelliher has warned that firefighters are in for a long night, with “tornado-like” winds expected to get worse. Kelliher said the terrain and wind combined created a “massive fight.” The 31st annual Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards nominations announcement, expected to take place live and in-person in Los Angeles on Wednesday night, has been canceled because of the ongoing wildfires. “Nominees will be unveiled tomorrow at 7:30 a.m. PT via press release and the SAG Awards website,” read a statement from the awards on X. The official SAG Awards ceremony, to be hosted by actress Kristen Bell this year, will take place on February 23. “I haven’t seen such extreme fire behavior in a very long time,” Los Angeles Fire Department Captain Sheila Kelliher told CNN. “The erratic winds are what’s the story,” said Kelliher, noting that she’s only seen this kind of fire behavior a few times in her 25 years on the job. Speaking to CNN from inside her car at Rogers Beach, she said that the department is using the roadside parking lot as a “command post” as erratic winds continue to strengthen wildfires that have jumped across roads towards the ocean. Kelliher described seeing the fire jump toward the beach and burning down two lifeguard towers. The air, she said, seemed to resemble snow or sleet falling with the winds –– except “that’s the ash and that’s the smoke.” The fire chief emphasized that safety is the department’s priority and that everyone in the fire’s path should heed evacuation orders. “It’s an actual fight. We can win. Some are too far gone,” she said. As tens of thousands of residents fled the Palisades fire on Tuesday, fire officials at one point used a bulldozer to move abandoned vehicles, which had piled up as evacuees became stuck in traffic and decided to flee on foot, off a road. Videos show the bulldozer scooping up cars and pushing them to the side, with flames and dark smoke visible a short distance away. The sound of metal grinding, glass breaking, car alarms going off and the bulldozer’s roar can be heard. Officials had to move 30 cars out of the way to clear the road, according to Traffic News Los Angeles. If you have to abandon a vehicle: “Get it as far off the road as you can so that emergency vehicles get by,” Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell said. As the Palisades fire rips through the Santa Monica mountains and coastal neighborhoods, it has damaged the Palisades Charter High School and nearby elementary school, a school board member told CNN on Tuesday night. The high school is “currently engulfed in flames,” said Nick Melvoin, a Los Angeles Unified School District board member. Firefighters are now “working heroically … to preserve the main structures,” but many facilities, including athletic buildings, baseball and tennis courts, and some bungalows, have been “destroyed,” he said. The nearby elementary school is also “on fire,” he added. “We’re just devastated … (I) also grew up playing soccer on those fields, and we’re all just in shock.” What to know about the school: The high school was formerly administered by LAUSD but is now an independent charter school, according to its website. The campus may look familiar to many, having been used during the filming of popular shows and films including “Teen Wolf,” “Carrie,” “Freaky Friday” and “American Vandal.” Melvoin said the school was not in session when the fire broke out, with students still on winter break. The Eaton fire, which erupted early Tuesday evening, has ripped through houses and structures in just a few hours and now measures 400 acres in size. Videos shared by Traffic News Los Angeles show a house going up in a blaze, with the fire crackling loudly. Only the skeleton of the house is still visible, as flames lick at the crumbling beams; seconds later the roof collapses, sending up plumes of dark smoke. Firefighters can be seen trying to put out the fire, with several hoses deployed. Around them, a fierce wind whips, sending red embers flying into the air and skittering down the road – the exact danger that firefighters warned could cause a blaze to spread quickly over a large area. Watch the video: Gusty winds, dry air and ongoing drought across Southern California have given conditions conducive for the Eaton fire to quickly grow to 400 acres. This fire is burning at the rate of over one football field a minute since beginning a few hours ago. The National Weather Service said that north to northeast winds across the ridges could reach as high as 80 mph overnight. Winds will shift direction to become more northeast on Wednesday, potentially still reaching 75 mph. These winds combined with humidities dropping into the single digits means that this fire could continue to spread quickly through the morning. Winds should begin to decrease by Wednesday afternoon but could still reach 40 mph. A firefighter has been seriously injured, the Los Angeles Fire Department confirmed on Tuesday night. “At approximately 8:30 PM, a 25-year-old female firefighter sustained a serious head injury. She received immediate treatment at the scene and was transported to a local hospital for further evaluation,” LAFD fire captain and public information officer Erik Scott wrote on X. He did not say whether the firefighter had been working to battle the Palisades or Eaton fires, which are raging simultaneously. He also said that around 9 p.m., “multiple burn victims were reported walking toward a nearby restaurant.” Medical resources were sent to the location to evaluate and treat the patients. The National Weather Service in Los Angeles has released some of the highest wind gusts through the day on Tuesday. Gusts in the area of the Palisades fire area reached between 40 and 60 mph through the day, but isolated gusts across Southern California reached more than 80 mph. Here are the some of the highest and notable reports: Magic Mountain Truck Trail: 86 mph Pacoima (Whiteman Apt.): 78 mph Saddle Peak: 72 mph Chilao: 69 mph Topanga: 43 mph Wind gusts are expected to continue to increase overnight and through Wednesday morning. “Widespread damaging north to northeast winds and extreme fire weather conditions will continue through Wednesday. Winds will peak through Wednesday morning. Downed trees and power lines, power outages, hazardous driving conditions, increased traffic, and airport delays are to be expected across the Southland,” warns the National Weather Service. These gusty winds combined with very dry air have prompted red flag warnings for more than 18 million people across Southern California. Widespread wind gusts could reach 80 mph with wind gusts across the San Gabriel and Santa Susana mountains as well as the foothills of the San Gabriel/San Fernando valleys potentially reaching 100 mph. Combined with dry air – with relative humidity dropping to 10 percent – ongoing fires and any new fires could quickly spread out of control. An iconic roadside restaurant in Malibu was destroyed by the Palisades fire as the blaze expanded late Tuesday. Reel Inn, a 36-year-old seafood restaurant on the Pacific Coast Highway, burned down just after 4 p.m., according to the Malibu Times. In a statement posted by its owners on Instagram, Teddy and Andy Leonard said they were “heartbroken and unsure of what will be left.” “Hopefully the state parks will let us rebuild when the dust settles,” they added. The owners said that all staff were safe. Reel Inn was reportedly engulfed by flames after the fire jumped Topanga Canyon in the late afternoon. The establishment was described as a “staple along the Pacific Coast Highway for decades,” the Malibu Times wrote, and a popular gathering spot for locals and tourists alike. Firefighters are battling wildfires in the Los Angeles area as a devastating wind storm has created extremely dangerous conditions. See some of the most stark photos below. A senior center in Pasadena evacuated its elderly residents on Tuesday night to a nearby parking lot in a chaotic scene as workers raced to get everybody out safe with flames burning just a block away, according to CNN affiliate KCAL. The Terraces at Park Marino facility decided to evacuate after the 400-acre Eaton fire spread nearby in the hills above Altadena. Video from KCAL shows dozens of residents in wheelchairs, many wearing only thin gowns and covered in shawls on the cold night. Some didn’t even have shoes, only their socks on in the rush to leave; workers hurriedly walked among them, tending to residents and covering them up from the wind. One worker helping the operation, identified as Randy, said they were trying to evacuate about 95 people in total. Ambulances and police cars wailed nearby, with some people being wheeled by in gurneys. ﻿Correction: This post as been updated to add the correct name of the senior center that was evacuated. It is The Terraces at Park Marino. California has received a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to fight the Eaton fire raging near Altadena, now reaching 400 acres in size, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on X. Earlier Tuesday, the state also received a Fire Management Assistance Grant from FEMA to fight the Palisades fire, which is more than 2,921 acres big. The grants will help support local fire departments in their response costs and are one of many resources the state will receive from the federal government in response to the fires. Vice President Kamala Harris said “My heart goes out to all those being impacted” by the wildfires in Southern California. “Doug and I are praying for our fellow Californians who have evacuated, and we are thinking of the families whose homes, businesses, and schools remain in harm’s way. We are deeply grateful for the heroic first responders who are risking their own safety to fight the flames and help keep communities safe,” she said in an overnight statement. Harris said that she has been briefed and will continue to receive updates on the wildfires. “As a proud daughter of California, I know the damage that wildfires have on our neighbors and communities. I also know that the impact is often felt long after the fire is contained. As we respond and as Californians recover, I will ensure that our administration is in constant contact with state and local officials,” she said. As fire crews battle the Eaton fire north of Pasadena, now 400 acres in size, their fight is limited by having grounded aircraft due to the extreme winds, said city spokesperson Lisa Derderian. Speaking to CNN affiliate KCAL, she said there were structures threatened and that city authorities were working to set up mass care and sheltering for evacuees. “Unfortunately, it’s a worst-case scenario that we were hoping we wouldn’t have to deal with,” she said. Evacuations: There are 10 zones under evacuation orders, which means there is an “immediate threat to life” and residents should leave immediately. An additional 18 ones are under potential threat, and are under evacuation warnings. Check the evacuation zones here. A fast-moving fire is forcing residents in Southern California to evacuate. Here’s what you should know about the blaze: Power outages: More than 100,000 people are without power in Los Angeles County, according to poweroutage.us — a database that tracks and aggregates live power outages in the US. Acreage: The fire so far has grown to 2,900 acres. According to Los Angeles Fire Department Captain Sheila Kelliher, whipping winds through the steep canyon makes fighting the fire “very challenging.” Firefighters had to move their command post due to the encroaching fire, she said, adding that the fire is “moving along pretty quick.” Evacuation orders: At least 30,000 people had been evacuated from a total of 10,000 households, 15,000 structures, businesses and other buildings. Wind speeds: Winds gusted at 40 to 60 mph during the day and could gust up to 80 mph overnight. This post has been updated with the latest information. As of 9:15 p.m. PST, roughly 184,400 customers in LA County are without power, according to PowerOutage.us. A CNN crew filmed their evacuation from an area where a dangerous wildfire is rapidly growing in Southern California. Five schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District will close on Wednesday due to fires, and classes will be moved online. The schools are Canyon Charter Elementary, Marquez Charter Elementary, Palisades Charter Elementary, Kenter Canyon Elementary and Paul Revere Middle School. “Topanga Elementary Charter School will continue its relocation to Woodland Hills Academy,” LA Unified said in a statement released on Tuesday night. The school district said that it will also prepare for the possibility of online learning on Thursday and that the decision would be made by Wednesday afternoon. “Schools will be in communication with families regarding any closures, relocations, or changes to operation hours and activities. Please look for communication from your school or Los Angeles Unified,” it said. The Eaton fire in Altadena is exploding at 400 acres, the Angeles National Forest said on X –– less than an hour after the fire was estimated at 200 acres. The organization has urged people in the eastern LA County area to evacuate immediately as high winds are forecast to continue overnight and tens of thousands also flee the Palisades fire. A time-lapse captured by webcams from Alert California and UC San Diego shows the raging Eaton fire moving fast and searing toward structures in Altadena. Evacuation orders have reached Santa Monica, the seaside city west of downtown Los Angeles, as the Palisades fire burns through five football fields a minute. “City of Santa Monica is issuing an Evacuation Order for all areas of the city north of San Vicente. Evacuation Order: Immediate threat to life. This is a lawful order to LEAVE NOW. The area is closed to public access,” the city said. That refers to an area at the northwest edge of the city, bordering the Santa Monica Canyon. Another major stretch right next to the order zone, ringed in by Montana Avenue and 26th Street, is under evacuation warning – meaning residents face potential threat to life and those who need additional time to evacuate should leave now. Eaton fire evacuations: As tens of thousands flee the Palisades fire, many are now beginning to evacuate from the Eaton fire, too – a new 400-acre blaze that erupted in Altadena, in eastern LA County. Nine zones in the area are under evacuation orders, while five more are under evacuation warnings. In a video posted to X on Tuesday evening, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that “hundreds and hundreds of personnel” from California are responding to the Palisades fire. Newsom also said airplanes, helicopters, bulldozers, water tenders and speciality personnel were “putting everything we can to not only suppress this fire but to prevent additional fires.” Newsom called the strong winds fuelling the fire “unprecedented” for this time of the year, adding that “this time of year traditionally has not been fire season, but now we disabuse any notion that there is a fire season. It’s year-round in the state of California.” Firefighters are in for a long night, with extreme wind conditions expected to get worse, warned Los Angeles County Fire Department Capt. Sheila Kelliher. Kelliher said the terrain and wind combined created a “massive fight.” Complicating matters is the nature of the wind, which “doesn’t just stay at one direction,” she added. “Just when you think you know what the fire is going to do, it swirls around and comes behind you. It’s definitely erratic, I think is one of the best words I can use to describe this wind, and it is strong,” she told CNN’s Laura Coates. She pointed to a burning hillside nearby, describing the “whipping tornado-like columns and spouts,” even taking a moment to catch her balance when the strong wind nearly knocked her over. “It’s the perfect storm, as they say – the low relative humidity, the high gusty winds, the low fuel moisture, the lack of rain and the excessive fuel growth that we’ve had over the last three years really have set this up for this once-in-a-decade wind event,” she said. President Joe Biden said that he is being “frequently briefed” on the wildfires in Los Angeles and that the White House “will do everything it can to support the response.” “My team and I are in touch with state and local officials, and I have offered any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire. Earlier tonight, FEMA approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to support areas that are impacted and help reimburse the state of California for the immediate firefighting costs. My Administration will do everything it can to support the response,” Biden said in a statement on Tuesday. “I urge the residents of the Pacific Palisades and the surrounding areas of Los Angeles to stay vigilant and listen to local officials,” he continued. The White House said that Biden has been briefed over the phone on the Palisades wildfire by FEMA Region 9 Administrator Bob Fenton. The Palisades fire is burning through about five football fields every minute in Southern California, as gusty winds spread the flames that have burned more than 2,900 acres, according to CAL Fire. The winds around the fire are expected to continue increasing to 60 to 80 mph overnight. Wednesday is forecast to bring more winds gusting over 60 mph, and another day of level 3 “extremely critical fire weather” in LA and Ventura counties. Mandatory evacuations in the Palisades fire have expanded east to Kenter and north to Mulholland Road as the fire has grown to 2,920 acres, the Los Angeles Fire Department said in an update. This comes as fire officials said the worst winds are expected between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. PT. “This remains an extremely dynamic situation and all residents in the area asked to monitor the news, LAFD Alerts and be prepared for possible evacuation,” the update said. A new fire has exploded to 200 acres in eastern Los Angeles County as the Palisades fire continues to grow rapidly. The Eaton fire in Altadena has prompted evacuations as high winds continue overnight, the Angeles National Forest said in a post on X. The US Forest Service, Los Angeles County Fire Department and the Pasadena Fire Department are in unified command, they said. The Los Angeles Fire Department is asking off-duty members to call in to potentially assist in fighting the Palisades fire. In a post on X, the department asked members to call in “with their availability for recall” after the fire grew rapidly throughout the day. CAL Fire, California’s firefighting agency, will assume command Wednesday morning. Cities surrounding Pacific Palisades have issued evacuation warnings and are urging caution as the Palisades fire continues to expand overnight. In Malibu, which is to the west of the fire, evacuation orders and warnings are in place for five zones, and the city encouraged residents to “be vigilant and ready to evacuate quickly if an evacuation order is given.” “We understand how deeply unsettling this is for our community, especially coming less than a month after the Franklin Fire and two months after the Broad Fire,” Malibu Mayor Doug Stewart said in a statement. “To those impacted by the Palisades Fire, our hearts are with you, and we want you to know the City is here to support you.” To the south, Santa Monica told residents to avoid the northern parts of the city to give space to first responders. A life-threatening, widespread windstorm has created extremely dangerous fire weather conditions in Southern California. See CNN National correspondent Natasha Chen’s reporting from the area: Two residents of Pacific Palisades, their exhausted faces covered in soot, described spending hours helping fire crews in their burning neighborhood. “We had a fire pump and, you know, we were able to probably save one or two houses with the firemen,” Greg Yost told CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.” “But three houses have gone up right around us.” Their strategy, he said, was to catch the fires early, watering any embers they see and saturating the fields near them. They said the strong winds make it easy for the fire to spread and even harder to put out. “This is as close as we’ve seen, and it’s black smoke everywhere,” fellow resident Jeff Marks said. The two men said they planned to stay through the night looking for fires in their area and helping to put them out as they see them. They’re texting residents information on their houses and said most people have evacuated – including their own families. “Maybe with a little bit of luck, we’ll be able to stay with it, but we made a big difference just for the few houses around us, for sure, with the firemen,” said Yost. The Palisades fire spans 1,261 acres, officials said Tuesday afternoon. The city of Los Angeles has declared a state of emergency, said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, president of the Los Angeles City Council. Here’s what to know: Burned area: Aerial reconnaissance shows that the Palisades fire has burned about 1,261 acres and growing with the help of strong winds and surrounding topography, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said Tuesday. The Pacific Palisades neighborhood is experiencing north to northeast winds around 15 mph with gusts up to 30 mph, but stronger wind gusts are expected overnight, officials warned. Evacuations: As of Tuesday afternoon, 30,000 people had been evacuated from a total of 10,000 households and 15,000 structures, businesses and other buildings, said Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell. Personnel in place: Over 250 firefighters are on scene fighting the Palisades fire, Crowley said Tuesday. This includes 46 engines, three trucks, five helicopters and six paramedic ambulances, among other resources. California had “pre-positioned hundreds of assets and personnel on Sunday in anticipation of this wind event,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a news briefing Tuesday, listing a range of resources brought down from different parts of the state. Newsom also expressed his gratitude to President Joe Biden, who is in Los Angeles, for federal assistance. California also received a Fire Management Assistance Grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Tuesday, Newsom announced on X. Abandoned vehicles: People faced traffic gridlock as they tried to flee the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, video from CNN affiliate KABC shows. Multiple people told KABC they left their cars trying to get out of the area. If evacuees have to abandon a vehicle, “get it as far off the road as you can so that emergency vehicles get by,” McDonnell said. Power cutoff: Southern California Edison, which supplies power to 5 million homes and businesses, has begun preemptively shutting off power to some customers to prevent its electric system from becoming a possible source of fire ignition. About 8,600 customers fall under the current Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS), which the utility describes as “a tool of last resort” amid heightened fire conditions. The shutoffs stretch across Los Angeles, Riverside and Ventura counties. The utility is considering shutoffs for more than 400,000 additional residents as extreme winds gust through parts of Southern California. Pacific Palisades has experienced fires in recent years: Home to about 27,000 residents, the picturesque seaside neighborhood sandwiched between Santa Monica and Malibu has experienced fires in recent years, the most recent being the Franklin fire that started in Malibu and reached into Pacific Palisades. Another fire hit the area in 2019, injuring at least two people. The Palisades fire has jumped across the highway, where cars were packed attempting to leave earlier in the day, and has burned two lifeguard towers on the beach, Los Angeles Fire Department Captain Sheila Kelliher told CNN. Speaking with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, she said the whipping winds through the steep canyon makes fighting the fire “very challenging” and that firefighters have to move their command post due to the encroaching fire. “It’s moving along pretty quick,” Kelliher said, noting they are seeing sustained gusts of 30 miles per hour. Hannah Lunkewitz, 19, is about to evacuate her home in the Pacific Palisades near the Bluffs with her parents and two brothers. Lunkewitz tells CNN they were going to drive their two cars out of the neighborhood, but their neighbors said they were all stuck in traffic. “I’m in contact with a lot of my friends who live here who evacuated, and it’s just so full, so much traffic, and no one’s really moving,” she said. Therefore, Lunkewitz said they may take their belongings and walk the 10 minutes to the Will Rogers State Beach instead. Lunkewitz is home from college for the holidays, so she said most of her belongings are already packed and ready to go including her clothes, a laptop and other necessities. Her parents are packing food, water, and important valuables, according to Lunkewitz. “I think I’m just in shock. It’s just unreal, so I don’t really know what to feel. I’m more nervous,” she said. Her family moved from Germany to the Pacific Palisades 10 years ago, and Lunkewitz can’t remember a fire so close to her home. “It’s just more unreal to have it in my neighborhood,” she said. The Getty Villa, a museum that houses a variety of relics from Greece and Rome, is safe from the fire, the museum said Tuesday night. While some of the trees and vegetation burned, the staff and “the staff and the collection remain safe,” said a statement from Katherine E. Fleming, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust, which runs the museum. “Fortunately, Getty had made extensive efforts to clear brush from the surrounding area as part of its fire mitigation efforts throughout the year,” she said. Additional measures include water storage, irrigation, as well as double-walled construction of the galleries and state-of-the-art air handling systems, she said. The museum is closed to the public on Tuesdays, and access to all non-emergency staff was “swiftly closed,” the statement said. “We are grateful for the tireless work of the Los Angeles Fire Department, Los Angeles County Fire Department, and other agencies to keep the Villa and its staff safe, as well as for the on-site presence of fire trucks throughout the day,” Fleming said. The museum is directly off the Pacific Coast Highway in the Pacific Palisades and also features a reconstruction of a Roman country house, according to its website. President Joe Biden has been briefed on the wildfires in Los Angeles and has been in contact with state and local officials, according to the White House. Following a request from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, FEMA has approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to support impacted communities, according to the White House. Biden is in Los Angeles and will depart on Wednesday morning to head back to the East Coast. California received a Fire Management Assistance Grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency Tuesday to assist in fighting the Palisades fire, Governor Gavin Newsom announced on X. The grant will help support the local fire department in their response costs, he said. This is one of many resources the state will from the federal government in response to the fire. A California driver says there were “flames and ash all around” while she was traveling toward Sunset Boulevard on Tuesday amid a growing wildfire. Kelsey Trainor shared video on X showing the flames and thick smoke during her drive. The fire “jumped to both sides of the road,” Trainor said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom expressed his gratitude to President Joe Biden for federal assistance as wildfires continued to rage in the Los Angeles area. “The President of the United States said, ‘Yes, what else do you need?’ Mercy proclamation to be drafted as we speak,” Newsom said at a news conference on Tuesday. “I just want to thank the president because that’s something I don’t take for granted. It’s something we should not take for granted at this moment in American history,” he said. Actor James Woods shared several videos on his X account as Tuesday’s California wildfire hit close to home. “Two houses from us…” Woods posted with a video of his neighbor’s Los Angeles home in flames. Two houses from us… pic.twitter.com/5lx6kMqdmN In another post, he shared a video of his back pool deck. The sky is completely filled with smoke and flames leap up from below where the deck ends. Woods said that he evacuated the area and is safe, while praising Los Angeles Fire and Police for “doing their jobs so well.” In one post, Wood said that there are several elementary schools in the area and there “was an enormous community effort to evacuate the children safely.” The actor posted that they do not know if their house is still standing. The Palisades Fire is burning around the Pacific Palisades, a neighborhood in between Santa Monica and Malibu. Some of the residents evacuating the Pacific Palisades and nearby Topanga on Tuesday are fleeing their homes for the second time in the span of a month as the coveted coastal communities have become a hotbed of fire activity. Just weeks ago, the destructive Franklin Fire ignited in neighboring Malibu, swallowing homes and vehicles and forcing residents – including Hollywood icons Dick Van Dyke and Cher – to flee their hillside properties. Evacuation warnings stretched along the Pacific Coast Highway past Topanga Canyon Boulevard, where residents are being ordered to pick up and evacuate again today. Both fires took residents by surprise as they raced through the lush scenery, rolling hills and canyons that make the neighborhoods some of the most desirable real estate in Southern California. Ultimately, the Franklin Fire consumed 4,000 acres and damaged or destroyed about 50 buildings, according to Cal Fire. The idyllic campus of Pepperdine University in Malibu sheltered in place in early December as the Franklin Fire loomed near the campus. And now, the school is eyeing the Pacific Palisades blaze as smoke billows on the horizon. As of Tuesday afternoon, the university said it was monitoring the fire but did not think it posed a threat to the campus. If evacuees have to abandon a vehicle, “get it as far off the road as you can so that emergency vehicles get by,” Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell said Tuesday at a news briefing. “We are asking really for the cooperation — and think a couple of steps ahead. It’s not just your vehicle there, but then others line up behind you as well as they see what you’re doing,” he said. California Governor Gavin Newsom chastised those who didn’t follow evacuation orders despite the harrowing conditions in the area. Even with “many structures already destroyed,” some did not evacuate quickly enough, he said, which “is a reminder of how serious this moment is and how important it is you listen to these evacuation orders.” “We’ve all been to memorials, I’ve never been to a memorial for a building,” he said. More context: Many residents had a difficult time evacuating Tuesday as the fire spread rapidly in a neighborhood filled with small, curvy roads. Video shows some streets filled with cars left behind as people evacuated as there were so many people leaving at once. LAFD Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said evacuations were slow, but they did occur, and the department will “follow up on that if there is anything better in the future that we can communicate to the constituents.” This post was updated with more context on the challenges on evacuating from the Palisades neighborhoods. Officials called the wildfires raging in the Los Angeles area on Tuesday pose a “public safety emergency” as hundreds of firefighters are on the frontlines battling the flames. “I want to reiterate, this is not a drill,” said Los Angeles city councilwoman Traci Park at a Tuesday news conference. For the areas under evacuation orders, Park urged residents to be “packed and ready to go and comply with all directions being given to you by law enforcement and our partners at the fire service.” Palisades residents who have been displaced by the fire can go to an emergency shelter at Westwood Recreation Center, Park said. “It may be some time until people are allowed to return to their homes and residences,” she continued. “Please bear with us through this period as our public safety partners work hard to protect lives and property and ensure that this area is safe before people return.” California had “pre-positioned hundreds of assets and personnel on Sunday in anticipation of this wind event,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a news briefing Tuesday, listing a range of resources brought down from different parts of the state to get ready for the weather conditions. “By no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods,” he added. There is no longer a fire season in California, but instead there is a “fire year,” the state’s governor said on Tuesday. “November, December, now January — there’s no fire season, it’s fire year. It’s year-round,” Newsom said at a news conference, recounting other major fires the state has battled this year. Now, the Palisades Fire has spread to more than 1,200 acres, the fire department said. Newsom warned resident to continue to heed warnings and evacuations because “we’re not out of the woods.” He looked ahead to more windy weather forecasts and cautioned the fire could continue to grow over the next hours and days. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is traveling back to the city after she was away on a diplomatic mission, Los Angeles City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson said. “She will be here within hours,” he said. The city of Los Angeles has declared a state of emergency and will have all resources on deck, said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, president of the Los Angeles City Council. Harris-Dawson said he is currently acting mayor of the city as Mayor Karen Bass was away on a diplomatic mission and making her way back. Over 250 firefighters are on scene fighting the Palisades Fire, Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley said Tuesday. This includes 46 engines, three trucks, five helicopters, six paramedic ambulances among other resources, she said. Evacuation orders are in place for over 30,000 residents in the Los Angeles area after two wildfires broke out on Tuesday, according to Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley at a news conference. “This is something that is going to get worse tonight,” said Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell. As of Tuesday afternoon, 30,000 people had been evacuated from a total of 10,000 households, 15,000 structures, businesses and other buildings, said McDonnell. Thousands of people are at risk in parts of California as the Palisades Fire continues to spread, the fire department said Tuesday. Threatened by the fire are: “We feel very blessed, at this point, that there are no injuries reported,” Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley said. Some structures have been damaged, however, she added,. Residents should know “we are not out of danger,” Los Angeles County Fire chief Anthony Marrone said Tuesday at a news briefing. “The National Weather Service has predicted that the winds are going to pick up and get worse. We are going to have a more significant wind event between 10 p.m. this evening and 5 a.m. tomorrow morning,” he noted. “So it’s incumbent that everybody have a wildfire action plan for their home if they live in a brush covered area,” he added, pointing to the LA County Fire Department website to find the “ready, set, go information.” The Los Angeles Police Department said a brush fire was first reported just north of the Palisades on Tuesday morning. The call about the fire came in at around 10:30 a.m. local time, Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley said at a news conference. “At the time of the fire, the relative humidity was 12 and the winds were approximately 25 mph with gusts up to 50 mph,” she said, adding that based on those conditions, the responding units sent more resources to respond to the brush fire. Initially, Crowley said officials reported a 10 acre fire, but it has since grown to more than 1,200 acres. High winds in the area are contributing to the conditions, data from the National Weather Service in Los Angeles shows. Before the news conference started, winds ripped a sign off the front of the podium. Aerial reconnaissance shows that the Palisades fire is currently at 1,261 acres and growing, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin M. Crowley said Tuesday. “The fire is being fueled by a combination of strong winds and surrounding topography, which is making it extremely challenging for our personnel that are assigned to this incident,” she added. California resident Nick McCormack tried to evacuate his parents from their Pacific Palisades home after a brush fire surrounded the area but was unable to do so, he told CNN. “They told me it looked like their fire was on the other side of the road,” McCormack said. “There was no one there giving directions or helping people evacuate. The cars were gridlocked so people began to abandon their cars or turn back around and go home.” According to McCormack, his 63-year-old mother and 65-year-old stepfather tried to evacuate the area around 1:30 p.m. but were unable to find a safe way out. McCormack said he tried to drive up the mountain to assist his parents but was also unable to find a safe road and is instead stuck watching the fire from the bottom of the mountain. McCormack’s parents have lived in the Pacific Palisades most of their lives and moved to The Highlands area of the neighborhood about five years ago, he said. Video that McCormack posted on social media shows large smoke plumes at the top of the mountain. Joe Goldman is trapped in his Pacific Palisades home as a fire continues to grow, he told CNN. “There’s one road in and one road out of the Pacific Palisades Highlands, but there’s fire surrounding it so there’s no way to get out. All the cars are stuck,” Goldman said. “We went to the Highlands where there is a fire road, but that road was also engulfed in flames, and it looked like houses up there were about to catch fire.” Goldman told CNN he tried to evacuate as soon as he was given the order to do so but ultimately decided to go back home after being unable to find a safe road out. “We’re staying home for now because it’s the safest thing we can do. I also had to go check on my friend’s dog and another friend’s elderly father who are also up here.” Goldman said he’s been monitoring the fire for the past couple of hours after he was informed that strong winds were supposed to impact the area. Videos Goldman shared with CNN show Goldman attempting to find a safe street to drive on but being met with fire instead. Goldman said he’s currently sheltering with three other people. The Palisades Fire has burned over 1,260 acres in a little over 3 hours, or nearly 4 football fields of land every minute on average since it first began Tuesday morning, according to data from CalFire. That’s about a football field every 15 seconds. North to northeast winds around 15 mph with gusts up to 30 mph are currently being observed near the base of the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, but stronger wind gusts to 50 mph have been occurring in the higher elevations where the fire is burning, according to data from the National Weather Service in Los Angeles. Wind gusts along the ridge tops are expected to increase this evening and overnight up to 60 to 70 mph at times. Widespread gusts of 30 to 35 mph are likely again on Wednesday with potentially a few gusts to 65 mph, as another day of level 3 of 3 ‘extremely critical fire weather’ is forecast for LA and Ventura Counties. Wind gusts of nearly 60 mph are already ongoing in parts of the San Monica Mountains, about 10 miles west of the Palisades Fire. The Los Angeles coastal community is once again at the center of another large fire, following the Franklin Fire last December. Pacific Palisades, a picturesque seaside neighborhood sandwiched between Santa Monica and Malibu, is home to about 27,000 residents, according to city councilmember Traci Park’s website. The area is known for its natural greenery and hiking trails along the coast of the Pacific Ocean, and “is one of Los Angeles’ safest and most affluent communities,” the website says. The area has experienced fires in recent years, the most recent being the Franklin Fire that started in Malibu and reached into Pacific Palisades. Another fire hit the area in 2019, injuring at least two people. Southern California Edison, which supplies power to 5 million homes and businesses, has begun preemptively shutting off power to some customers in order to prevent its electric system from becoming a possible source of fire ignition. About 8,600 customers fall under the current Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS), which the utility describes as “a tool of last resort” amid heightened fire conditions. The shutoffs stretch across Los Angeles, Riverside and Ventura Counties. The utility is considering shutoffs for more than 400,000 additional residents as extreme winds gust through parts of Southern California. “We consider PSPS when strong winds, very dry plants and grass and low humidity are forecast,” Souther California Edison said. “Under these conditions, a fire could spread rapidly. PSPS reduces the risk that winds could cause flying debris to hit our lines or damage our equipment and cause a fire.” The Palisades Fire has now reached over 700 acres, the City of Los Angeles said in an update. Rachel Silver, a resident in Pacific Palisades, said she and her family had to evacuate at a moment’s notice, all while the nearby palm trees burned around them. She said she’s “never been through this” after they left their car at the bottom of Palisades Drive to get away from the fast-moving fire. She said while she’s worried about her home, all she cared about was “getting the dogs out” and that her “kids were safe.” Children in at least four schools in the Pacific Palisades area are being relocated as a wildfire explodes in the hillside enclave, the Los Angeles United School District announced on X. Palisades Charter Elementary School, Marquez Charter Elementary School, Paul Revere Charter Middle School and Topanga Elementary Charter will move their students to other school campuses, the district said. Pepperdine University in Malibu, which was threatened by the Franklin Fire just last month, said it is monitoring the Palisades fire but is currently not at risk. As of about 1:30 p.m. local time, the fire was about nine miles from the campus, it said. Officials from the Los Angeles Fire Department plan to give an update on the Palisades Fire at 3:30 pm PT, they said in a post on X. The news conference will be held at Will Rogers State Beach, which is in nearby Santa Monica. The headline and post were updated with the timing for the news conference. At least one structure is on fire in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, with flames overtaking the roof, video from CNN affiliate KABC shows. KABC video shows smoke filling the neighborhood, making it difficult to see if more structures are on fire. A Los Angeles Fire Department official previously told KABC it did not have confirmation of structures on fires. The Palisades Fire is now at least 300 acres and continues to grow, the Los Angeles Fire Department said in an update. Evacuation orders remain within the previously designated area and Westwood Recreation Center is open for evacuees. Los Angeles emergency crews are urgently evacuating residents in large areas of the Pacific Palisades as furious winds drive a quickly-growing wildfire in the area. “This is a fast-moving fire within these heavy brush hills and our main concern right now is for everyone to follow the evacuation order,” Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson Margaret Stewart told CNN affiliate KABC. People should avoid the Pacific Coast Highway along the Los Angeles coastline unless they are actively evacuating, Steward said. The road should be kept as open as possible for evacuees and emergency crews. “This could be the difference in someone’s life or death if we can get people safely evacuated,” Stewart told KABC. Though the fire department prepositioned resources in anticipation of Monday’s severe fire risk, battling the flames will still be a difficult undertaking. “This is going to be a challenging fire because this type of wind is going to push the ember casts easily a mile down and can start spot fires,” Stewart said. Traffic is gridlocked as people try and flee the Pacific Palisades neighborhood as a large fire encroaches on residential structures, video from CNN affiliate KABC shows. Multiple videos from KABC shows traffic backed up along the Pacific Coast Highway as well as in more inland neighborhoods. Multiple people told KABC they left their cars trying to get out of the area. Meteorologists with the National Weather Service in Los Angeles used the most dire language possible to characterize the windstorm and fire threats. The “life-threatening” windstorm “will likely be the most destructive” since a 2011 event “that did extensive damage to Pasadena and nearby foothills of the San Gabriel Valley,” the weather service warned. The 2011 windstorm downed hundreds of trees and knocked out power for days because the seasonally strong Santa Ana winds dipped into more populous, lower elevation areas typically sheltered from them. That will be the case again with this event. Many areas of Los Angeles and eastern Ventura counties, including portions of the Los Angeles basin and San Gabriel Valley, are at risk of damaging hurricane-force wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph Tuesday afternoon into early Wednesday. Gusts between 80 and 100 mph are likely in higher elevation areas. Winds will “accelerate to dangerous levels” starting Tuesday afternoon, according to the NWS. High wind warnings are in effect through at least Wednesday for much of Southern California. The strong winds will likely result in widespread downed trees as well as widespread power outages. Winds will also be strong enough to bring down power lines, which could spark fires. Any fire starts during this time could quickly turn into an out-of-control blaze. Power shutoffs are possible this week as Southern California’s energy providers try to prevent damaged infrastructure from starting blazes. More than 400,000 of Southern California Edison’s 5 million customers may have their power shut off in the coming days, according to the utility’s website. Extreme dryness during what is typically the wettest time of the year is also helping to drive the fire threat. Fire officials are warning residents to be prepared to evacuate as the fast-growing Palisades Fire burns toward structures and other fires break out amid a violent windstorm in Southern California. The Palisades Fire was first spotted just after 10 a.m. local time in the mountains north of Los Angeles’ Pacific Palisades neighborhood on the west side of the city and has since spread to 200 acres, according to CalFire. The fire could soon threaten nearby structures on Palisades Drive, causing the Los Angeles Fire Department to warn residents there to “get set for a potential wildfire evacuation.” Evacuation warnings have been issued for four zones near the fire, according to fire officials. Getting resources to any new fires quickly is paramount to contain the blazes as winds roar over the region. “If we don’t catch these within the first 20 minutes, it can go hundreds of acres very quickly and can lead to significant evacuations,” Capt. Erik Scott, the LAFD’s public information officer told CNN affiliate KABC Tuesday. Another wildfire broke out near Sunset Boulevard in the Hollywood Hills around the same time on Tuesday morning. North to northeast winds of 5 to 15 mph with gusts up to 30 mph are currently being observed near the base of the Pacific Palisades neighborhood. Stronger wind gusts are likely occurring in the higher elevations where the fire is burning. Winds will continue to increase Tuesday into Wednesday across Southern California, including where the Palisades Fire is burning. Wind gusts near the fire could reach 45 mph during the day Tuesday and hit 70 mph at times overnight. Widespread gusts of 30 to 35 mph are likely Wednesday with potentially a few gusts to 65 mph. Wind gusts elsewhere in Southern California could reach 80 mph over the next 24 hours with some gusts up to 100 mph possible in the mountains. © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

                "title": "California Fire Map, Update as Palisades, Eaton, Hurst Blazes Burn LA - Newsweek",
                "content": "A number of wildfires are burning across California, predominantly to the north and west of Los Angeles, with Governor Gavin Newsom declaring a state of emergency on Tuesday. The largest of the infernos, which hit the upmarket Pacific Palisades neighborhood, has burned through more than 2,900 acres with meteorologist Paul Deanno describing it as a \"near worst-case scenario,\" noting the winds. Three additional wildfires are ablaze to the north of Los Angeles according to monitoring website Watch Duty, with the second largest being the Eaton Fire which has ripped across 1,000 acres, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). An additional blaze broke out much further south near San Diego, which consumed two acres. President Biden announced on Tuesday evening that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had \"approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to support areas that are impacted.\" By some margin the largest of the California infernos, the Palisades fire had consumed 2,921 acres in the Pacific Palisades as of 3 a.m. ET on Wednesday, according to the CAL FIRE. The agency said to expect \"extreme fire\" with \"wind gusts up to 60 MPH [miles per hour]\" expected through Thursday as it responds along with Los Angeles County Fire and Los Angeles City Fire. According to the California Department of Transportation, the Pacific Coastal Highway has been closed between Las Flores Canyon Road and the Santa Monica Freeway. CAL FIRE Evacuation Orders, meaning there is a lawful order to leave in response to an \"immediate threat to life,\" are in place for LOS-Q0767, MAL-C111-A, MAL-C111-B, MAL-C112-B, RMB-U030-A, RMB-U030-B, SAN-Q1395-B, SAN-Q1396-B, SSM-U010-A, SSM-U010-B, TOP-U001, TOP-U002, TOP-U003, TOP-U004, TOP-U005, TOP-U006, TOP-U007, TOP-U008, TOP-U009. Evacuation Warnings, with \"potential threat to life and/or property, have also been declared for CAL-C405, CAL-C406, CAL-C407, CAL-C408, CAL-C409, CAL-C410, CAL-C411, CAL-C412, CAL-C413, CAL-C414, CAL-C415, DRY-U026, MAL-C112, MAL-C112-A, MTN-U028, RMB-U030-C, RRC-U027, SAN-Q1395-A, SAN-Q1396-A, SDP-U029. The Westwood Recreation Center at 1350 South Sepulveda Blvd and the El Camino Real Charter High School at 5440 Valey Circle Blvd have both been turned into evacuation centers. CAL FIRE said the cause of the Palisades fire is currently under investigation. The Eaton Fire, situated on the northern outskirts of Pasadena, has consumed 1,000 acres as of early Wednesday morning, according to CAL FIRE. The agency said: \"High winds are driving rapid fire growth, posing a significant threat to nearby communities and making containment efforts challenging. \"Firefighters are working aggressively to slow the spread and protect critical infrastructure under extreme conditions. The combination of low humidity, dry fuels, and shifting winds has heightened the potential for spot fires and rapid expansion. Residents are urged to remain alert and follow instructions from local authorities as the situation evolves.\" All schools in the Pasadena Unified School District have been closed on January 8. Evacuation orders have been issued for \"Zones ALD-EASTLOMA, ALD-EATONCANYON, ALD-GARFIAS, ALD-MENDOCINO, ALD-MIDLOTHIAN, ALD-MOUNTLOWE, ALD-RUBIO, ARC-001, ARC-002, ARC-004, KIN-KINNELOA, LAC-E183, PAS-E019, PAS-E022, SMD-E001, SMD-E002, SMD-E003, SMD-E004, SMD-E005, SMD-E006, SMD-E007, SMD-E008, SMD-E009, SMD-E010, SMD-E011, SMD-E012, SMD-E013, SMD-E014, SMD-E015, SMD-E016, SMD-E017, SMD-E019.\" They also cover the \"area north of Orange Grove/Rosemead Blvd., east of Lake Ave., and west of Michillinda Ave.\" The El Camino Real Charter High School on 5440 Valley Circle Blvd, the Pasadena Convention Center at 300 E Green St and the Westwood Recreation Center on 1350 S Sepulveda Blvd have been turned into evacuation shelters. The Hurst Fire has engulfed 100 acres near Diamond Road, Sylmar, according to CAL FIRE with evacuation orders in place for \"LAC-E132-A, LAC-E132-B, LOS-E001, SCL-CALGROVE, SCL-ETERNAL, SCL-NEWHALLPASS, SCL-WILDWOOD,\" though the agency warns these are \"rapidly changing.\" According to CAL FIRE: \"The Hurst Fire is spreading rapidly under high winds, creating dangerous conditions for nearby communities. Fire crews are working tirelessly to contain the fire and protect critical infrastructure as it threatens homes and other structures. \"The combination of dry fuels, strong winds, and low humidity is contributing to aggressive fire behavior, making containment efforts extremely challenging. Residents are urged to remain vigilant and follow directives from local authorities as the situation evolves.\" According to Watch Duty, a 0.5-acre blaze is underway near where Tuxford Street bisects the Golden State freeway in northern Los Angeles. Watch Duty staff reporter Michael Silvester described it as a \"vegetation fire\" covering \"a half acre of grass and pine trees adjacent to the freeway.\" Watch Duty reported a two-acre blaze underway in southern California on the northern outskirts of San Diego by the Cabrillo Freeway, close to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.

                "content": "Newcastle United took one step closer to the Wembley with a superb 2-0 victory over Arsenal in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final at the Emirates Stadium. Eddie Howe named an attacking line-up for the Magpies and they showed their intent from the start with a high press and a willingness to get men into the final third when in possession. Their early dominance threatened to be a false dawn though as Arsenal swiftly played through them to set Gabriel Martinelli up with a brilliant chance to open the scoring only for the winger to strike the post. Alexander Isak was more clinical at the other end. He ran onto the end of a Jacob Murphy pass to slot past David Raya and give Newcastle the lead before half-time. After the restart, Anthony Gordon arrived in the box at the right time as Isak had another shot stopped by Raya only for the goalkeeper to serve up an easy tap-in to Gordon. Howe then made changes and set the team up defensively. Arsenal threw everything at them but couldn’t cut the deficit and will have a tough task ahead of the return leg at St. James’ Park. Relive the action from the Emirates Stadium with our live blog below: Arsenal beaten Newcastle in the Carabao Cup semi-finals FT Newcastle win at Emirates and take two-goal cushion into second leg 51’ GOAL!

Martinelli hits the post after a breakaway (ARS 0-0 NEW) Arsenal FC 0 - 2 Newcastle United FC 22:35 , Mike Jones “First half he was electric, I thought he played really well. He scored but I just thought his general game was in a really good place. He was feeling his hamstring a bit at half-time so we had to manage him in the second half and that was a big blow to our performance. “I think we rode our luck at times and I think Martin [Dubravka] played really well and made some really good saves. I thought the set plays in the main we got the small details right. Our mentality to defend our goal with the blocked shots, the heroic pieces of defending that we saw in the last 20 to 30 minutes, it’s great for us for the future.” 22:31 , Mike Jones A night that was about whether you could take your chances; for goals, and maybe for finals. The overly cynical might even say it was for showing what you can really do in front of a certain audience, especially in regards to Alexander Isak. Arsenal’s widely reported interest in the Swede added another strand to a narrative-rich Carabao Cup semi-final, and his presence ended up deciding how this 2-0 win went. Newcastle United would rightly bristle at that being the focus of a match that might end up sending them to Wembley for the second time in three years. Arsenal do still have a second leg in a month to overturn this, but that will be at an intimidating St James Park, where the crowd will see this trophy as being about so much more than this trophy. The Saudi Arabian project has felt like it has needed a lift after a long lull, and this might be it. For all that recent issues had fed a debate over whether the controversial ownership are overseeing the club in the fulsome manner they have other projects, their willingness to spend what they can has given Newcastle one of the finest players in world football right now. Alexander Isak’s ruthlessness reveals where Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal must improve 22:31 , Mike Jones “Very pleased with the players, it was a tough game for us in many respects. We’ve had players struggling at half-time. Really pleased with how we played.” 22:24 , Mike Jones “Very proud, it was always going to be like that in the second half. Too a man everyone defended brilliant. “To get a result here you need to defend set-pieces, but I thought everyone was brilliant. “We have had a sticky patch, but we have had a few clean sheets in a row. Seeing the way we defended in the second half was brilliant. “It’s only a job half done - they have nothing to lose coming to St. James’ Park.” 22:21 , Mike Jones “I think it comes down to a team thing. “We have been solid defensively and then we have the quality up front. Jacob [Murphy] assisted me and I tried to be in the right place to finish the attacks. “We came here with the intention to bring a good result home and we did. “We have some time to change things, come back and do the same at St. James’ Park.” 22:18 , Mike Jones “We weren’t doing it at the start of the season and we weren’t putting work in at the start of the season. We don’t have time to celebrating this one. “They’re one of the best sides in Europe, it’s only 2-0. We need to stay humble.” 22:15 , Mike Jones “It’s up there. We knew what type of game it would be, they’re dominant at home. It was always going to be a smash-and-grab. “I think so. I think everyone is in agreement with that. He’s [Alexander Isak] on fire. Even for my goal. I’m just gambling back post. It’s all about attitude. It was unbelievable to a man. I want to mention Dan Burn, he’s been our player of the season for me.” 22:12 , Mike Jones Since 1987-88, this is the ninth time an away team will have held a two-goal advantage after a semi-final first leg, with all eight previous occasions seeing the side progress to the final. 22:02 , Mike Jones 21:57 , Mike Jones Newcastle took one step closer to the Wembley with a superb 2-0 victory over Arsenal in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final at the Emirates Stadium. Eddie Howe named an attacking line-up for the Magpies and they showed their intent from the start with a high press and a willingness to get men into the final third when in possession. Their early dominance threatened to be a false dawn though as Arsenal swiftly played through them to set Gabriel Martinelli up with a brilliant chance to open the scoring only for the winger to strike the post. Alexander Isak was more clinical at the other end. He ran onto the end of a Jacob Murphy pass to slot past David Raya and give Newcastle the lead before half-time. After the restart, Anthony Gordon arrived in the box at the right time as Isak had another shot stopped by Raya only for the goalkeeper to serve up an easy tap-in to Gordon. Howe then made changes and set the team up defensively. Arsenal threw everything at them but couldn’t cut the deficit and will have a tough task ahead of the return leg at St. James’ Park. 21:54 , Mike Jones 90+5 mins: The full-time whistle goes. Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon’s goals give Newcastle a two-goal cushion. It’s a seventh successive win for Newcastle and they are one step closer to the final at Wembley. 21:51 , Mike Jones 90+3 mins: Cross after cross comes into the box from both sides of the pitch but Newcastle’s centre-backs are holding firm. They’ve played more than half of the added time but still have work to do to get this result confirmed. 21:49 , Mike Jones 90 mins: Five minutes of added time to play. That seems like a lot, there haven’t been many stoppages in this this. Regardless it’s more than enough time for Arsenal to get their goal. Can they do it? 21:45 , Mike Jones 87 mins: Jorginho takes a shot from the edge of the box and curls a decent effort just wide of the far post. Arsenal are coming closer but they’ve yet to break through Newcastle’s defences. 21:42 , Mike Jones 84 mins: Martin Dubravka takes as long as it is possible before restarting the match from a goal kick. Newcastle are employing plenty of football’s dark arts to keep Arsenal at bay. Gabriel Jesus is punished for a nudge on Tonali. Free kick Newcastle. 21:38 , Mike Jones 81 mins: Jorginho chips a pass into the box and finds Kai Havertz. Havertz then dinks the ball into the six yard area on the stretch and hopes to find Gabriel Jesus but only ends up giving the ball to Maritn Dubravka. 21:36 , Mike Jones 78 mins: Newcastle are content with their cushion. They’re are fully focused on making sure Arsenal don’t score meaning there’s an edge to the end of this game. The Gunners are playing entirely in Newcastle’s half now. 21:33 , Mike Jones 75 mins: 15 minutes to play and Arsenal are pressing intently. Lewis Hall does well to evade a couple of tackles before Joelinton wins a free kick with some fine hold up play. Anthony Gordon is now replaced with Miguel Almiron and Newcastle eke out a few more seconds. 21:30 , Mike Jones 72 mins: Newcastle’s main issue now is that there’s no way out for them when they’re trying to play out from the back. Arsenal are quicker and sharper and there’s still a long time left in this game. Arsenal will surely pull a goal back at this rate. Dubravka punches away another corner kick but Arsenal recover the ball immediately. 21:28 , Mike Jones 71 mins: A storming run from Declan Rice wins another corner for Arsenal. This cross is poor though and Rice hooks the ball straight into the side netting. There’s a nervous energy around the stadium as Arsenal search for a goal. Newcastle are now set up with five players in defence, four in midfield and Gordon alone in the front line. They’re holding on to what they’ve got. 21:26 , Mike Jones 68 mins: Howe’s changes mean Newcastle will be less adventrous. Anthony Gordon, who is on a yellow card, is now playing down the middle as the main target man. Martinelli receives the ball for Arsenal and attacks from the left. He squares a pass into the box but Hall boots it clear despite the danger being minimal. 21:23 , Mike Jones 66 mins: Eddie Howe reacts to Arteta’s changes with three of his own. Jacob Murphy, Joe Willock and Alexander Isak are taken off with Harvey Barnes, Sean Longstaff and Lloyd Kelly brought on. 21:22 , Mike Jones 64 mins: Joe Willock gets back and turns a pass behind for a corner. Declan Rice delivers the set piece and finds William Saliba at the back post this time. It’s another opportunity for Arsenal but Saliba nods it it over the top. 21:20 , Mike Jones 63 mins: Mikel Arteta has made a couple of changes. Leandro Trossard and Thomas Partey have been hooked off with Gabriel Jesus and Jorginho brought on. Can Arsenal find a way back into this match? 21:17 , Mike Jones 58 mins: Chance! Leandro Trossard comes down the right wing and sends a cross into the box. Lewis Hall half blocks it but the ball loops into the air and drops into the middle of the penalty area. Somehow, Kai Havertz is wide open but misses out on a header and the ball hits his shoulder and bounces wide of the target. 21:15 , Mike Jones 57 mins: Tonali lifts a cross into the Arsenal box and Raya flaps it away. The goalkeeper isn’t in control of the clearance but luckily the ball falls to an Arsenal defender who clears. There’s an urgency and erratic nature to Arsenal now. They need to pull something out of the hat. 21:13 , Mike Jones 54 mins: It could be a long way back from here for Arsenal. Even though the tie is played over two legs you feel they need a goal here at the very least to be in with a shout of overturning the deficit at St. James’ Park. The difficulty is overcommiting and conceding another. Three goals would be almost impossible to overturn. 21:10 , Mike Jones Massive moment! Six minutes into to the second half and Newcastle have a second goal. Alexander Isak steps out of the forward position and drops to receive the ball. He turns it to Jacob Murphy who takes the ball up to the edge of the box before slotting a pass back to Isak. Isak shoots and draws a leaping save out of David Raya who only manages to push the ball into the path of Anthony Gordon for a tap in. 21:05 , Mike Jones 48 mins: The first half was a blistering affair of end-to-end action. With Newcastle now in front expect that to change with Eddie Howe’s men preferring to stay more defensively secure. They’ll still want a second goal but will take less risks with their press I expect. 21:03 , Mike Jones Arsenal restart the match for the second half. Newcastle have never won a league cup tie against Arsenal but they are on the way to taking an advantage into the second leg. No changes at the break from either manager. 21:00 , Mike Jones Arsenal have had 14 shots in the first half with three on target. Newcastle have been more ruthless though with five attempts and two on target including Alexander Isak’s goal. Who will perform the better in the second half? 20:56 , Mike Jones 20:52 , Mike Jones Alexander Isak has the only goal for the game so far. Can Arsenal respond in the second half? Who else but Alexander Isak?Newcastle break the deadlock in North London! 💥 pic.twitter.com/Qv80CKvqAD — Sky Sports Football (@SkyFootball) January 7, 2025 20:47 , Mike Jones 45+2 mins: Newcastle attempt to get out from their own final third. Anthony Gordon crunches Leandro Trossard as the pair fight over the ball. The referee lets play go on and Alexander Isak wins Newcastle a throw in on the left wing. The whistle then goes for the break. 20:45 , Mike Jones 45 mins: Arsenal recycle the ball into the box and the ball drops lovely for Gabriel. He hooks a nice shot towards the target but hits the goalkeeper who didn’t know much about that one. Dubravka makes the save though. Two minutes added on at the end of the first half. 20:44 , Mike Jones 43 mins: Joelinton takes out Thomas Partey in a dangerous position for Newcastle. Right in front of goal with enough distance to get the ball up and down. Martin Odegaard and Leandro Trossard stand over the ball but it’s Odegaard who nails the shot straight into the wall. 20:40 , Mike Jones 40 mins: Declan Rice tries to immediately respond for Arsenal and probes at a gap in the Newcastle defence. He pulls the ball back into the middle of the box but only manages to give it to Martin Dubravka. 20:38 , Mike Jones Bang! Newcastle’s star man is the one to break the deadlock. Martin Dubravka fires a free kick up the pitch and looks to pick out Sven Botman. Botman tussles with William Saliba in the air and manages to glance the ball on to Jacob Murphy who nudges it forward. The ball bounces into the penalty area and Alexander Isak is the first to react. He sprints to the ball then smokes it past David Raya. Newcastle lead. 20:36 , Mike Jones 34 mins: A quick free kick from Newcastle is flicked forward towards Isak making another one of his cutting runs. The ball floats over his head and Timber collects for the Gunners before sending it along the back line for slow build up play from the defence. 20:33 , Mike Jones 31 mins: Another Arsenal set piece results in a wild scramble inside the Newcastle penalty area. Black and white shirts throw themselves in front of the ball and there’s no way through for the Gunners. Arsenal have wrestled the momentum in their favour and Newcastle need a response. 20:30 , Mike Jones 28 mins: POST! Arsenal should be in front. Newcastle step up the pitch but some quick passes between Rice and Trossard manages to send Gabriel Martinelli free in behind the back line. He carries the ball into the penalty area then blazes a shot towards the nearest post. He strikes it well and rattles the woodwork! 20:26 , Mike Jones 27 mins: Arsenal look to play out from the back and gets closed down inside his own penalty area. Jacob Murphy and Sandro Tonali pincer him but the youngster manages to dart through a gap with the ball and win a free kick to ease the pressure. Newcastle’s press has been very good tonight. 20:23 , Mike Jones 24 mins: Joe Willock gets back to help out the defence and deflects a Leandro Trossard cross behind for a corner. Martin Odegaard comes over to take this one and curls the set piece into the penalty area. Martin Dubravka comes off his line and punches the ball well clear in a confident sign for the Newcastl goalkeeper. 20:20 , Mike Jones 21 mins: The game has been pretty end-to-end over the opening 20 minutes and Arsenal are just trying to assert some control on proceedings and slow down the tempo. Martin Odegaard’s pass out wide is almost intercepted by Tino Livramento. The defender gets to the ball first but slides into Gabriel Martinelli with his follow through. The Arsenal winger winces in pain but seems okay to play on. 20:17 , Mike Jones 18 mins: You can’t help but feel as though Newcastle’s gameplan could backfire on them if Arsenal score first. Their commitment to fling men forward means there is plenty of space for Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard to run into. Sandro Tonali is just now realising that he’s in for a lot of work tonight sprinting back and forth in search of the ball. 20:16 , Mike Jones 16 mins: Isak darts across the pitch and collects a pass that comes down the right wing. He cuts the ball back into the box but Anthony Gordon overruns the pass. Behind him, Lewis Hall collects the ball and slips it across to Sandro Tonali who fizzes a shot from range over the top. 20:14 , Mike Jones 15 mins: Newcastle aren’t shy about getting men forward when they have the ball. It’s an attacking mindset that Eddie Howe has instilled in his players and it’s making Arsenal a little uncomfortable in this opening stages. It’s been a good start to this match but teams visibly want to win. 20:13 , Mike Jones 13 mins: Gabriel Martinelli dances into the box from the left and runs at Sven Botman. He manages to get a pass into the middle but Dan Burn is there to turn the ball behind for a corner. Declan Rice delivers again and picks out Jurrien Timber for a second time. Timber mistimes his jump and gets to the ball as he falls back to earth meaning his headed effort is sent over the top of the crossbar. 20:11 , Mike Jones 12 mins: Scramble! An Arsenal free kick is lofted into the box and Newcastle do okay to clear it. It comes to the edge of the box where Gabriel Martinelli brings the ball under control before drilling a shot at goal. His effort is deflected to William Saliba who tries the same thing. His shot gets through but a lunging Dan Burn stops Kai Havertz from turning it home. Martin Dubravka smothers the ball and the attack dies down. 20:09 , Mike Jones 9 mins: Arsenal are set up with Leandro Trossard on the right wing of the forward line. He doesn’t usually play here but in Bukayo Saka’s absence Mikel Arteta must feel as though Gabriel Martinelli is the more effective of the two on the left wing. 20:06 , Mike Jones 6 mins: Arsenal win their first set piece of the game. The Gunners have been incredible at scoring from set plays this season and this corner is sent into the box buy Declan Ric3e. He picks out Jurrien Timber but the defender’s header is directed wide of the target. 20:05 , Mike Jones 5 mins: Nearly! Arsenal’s centre-backs are asleep as a ball is played over the top for Alexander Isak. The striker makes a run in behind and keeps himself onside before touching the ball into the box. He pulls it back to Joelinton who attempts a first time shot on a bobbling pass. He doesn’t connect properly and lifts the effort over the crossbar. 20:03 , Mike Jones 3 mins: Arsenal look to control possession but a poor pass into midfield is intercepted. Newcastle send the ball to Alexander Isak who spins and releases it to Jacob Murphy arriving in the box from the right. Murphy shoots but his effort is blocked and the Gunners clear their lines. 20:01 , Mike Jones Newcastle get the ball rolling at the Emirates Stadium and work it over to the left wing. Joelinton is fed down the line and comes up against Jurrien Timber who manages to win a throw in for Arsenal. 19:55 , Mike Jones The players make their way out onto the pitch at the Emirates Stadium. The Newcastle fans are in full voice and have travelled a long way for this match. It’s only the first leg but both managers have picked strong teams with the aim to win the game. For Arsenal, Martin Odegaard returns and captains the team. He leads the players out on the pitch. Kick off is up next... 19:50 , Mike Jones Alexander Isak could become the first Magpies player to score against Arsenal in two different games in a single campaign since Laurent Robert in 2001/02. 19:45 , Mike Jones It’s a week where only four Premier League teams have double fixtures, so it consequently becomes a little double-edged. Although the Carabao Cup semi-final managers are at a stage of the season where their squads could badly do with time to breathe, the fact they are so close to Wembley means they feel they have little choice but to go all in. There’s a trophy to be won. That just means they lose a little bit of ground on, well, the training ground after the hectic December schedule. It’s perhaps just as well for Mikel Arteta and Arne Slot, in particular, that they have the FA Cup rather than Premier League at the weekend. We can expect some drastically changed sides. There should be a sadness to that but it does point to one of many contradictions in the modern game. Football has become so forensically systemised - to the point some call it “NFLisation” - and yet there’s so little actual time in the calendar for the elite teams to hone those systems. The cost of football’s packed schedule is a double-edged sword for players 19:40 , Mike Jones Gabriel Jesus has been involved in 13 goals in his last nine starts in the League Cup (11 goals, 2 assists). 19:35 , Mike Jones Newcastle captain Bruno Guimaraes misses tonight’s match due to a suspension for picking up too many yellow cards in the previous rounds. The Magpies boss, Eddie Howe, spoke about what it’ll be like to play without his talisman and said: “It’s a big blow. One of Bruno’s biggest strengths is he is always there for you. “His record has been brilliant for us especially when you consider the physical exertion that he commits to every game. “His training is very good and he’s been exceptional in every way so to lose him, and he’s a pivotal figure for us, is going to be a big miss but we have good players that can fill his shoes as well so, whoever I choose in that position, I have a lot of quality players.” 19:30 , Mike Jones This is only Newcastle’s third appearance in the League Cup semi-finals, but they’ve progressed to the final in each of the previous two (1975/76 vs Tottenham, 2022/23 vs Southampton). 19:25 , Mike Jones Eddie Howe has praised the extraordinary effort of Newcastle defender Sven Botman after he marked his eagerly-anticipated return with a strong display in a 2-1 win at Tottenham. Fabian Schar’s suspension meant Botman was thrust into the Magpies line-up to make his first competitive appearance since March following anterior cruciate ligament damage. Eddie Howe heaps praise on Sven Botman after return from injury at Tottenham 19:20 , Mike Jones Arsenal have scored 11 goals in their three League Cup matches this season, netting at least three each time. They’ve never scored 3+ goals in four consecutive games in the competition. 19:15 , Mike Jones Mikel Arteta believes his players are learning to adapt to different situations and positions as he attempts to limit the negative affect of long-term injuries on his squad. The Arsenal manager said: “We discussed the situation and the fact that we have to use players in positions that they probably haven’t played in before. “We are learning a lot from that and what I learn especially is the willingness of the team; you speak to any individual and ask him to play anywhere on the field and they say: ‘I’m there’. That’s great as well to learn from your players. “It’s a good learning process, not only tactically but also preparation and training with very few players. Today we had seven or eight players with us just to fill the squad which isn’t normal but it’s a weird way to learn, but I’ll take it. “I cannot change it so let’s take the things that we can get out of it to be better.” 19:10 , Mike Jones The Arsenal boss says that Newcastle’s in-form striker is a ‘top-player’ and that his team will attempt to minimise his impact this evening. Arteta said: “He’s a top player in top form scoring a lot of goals and we try to minimise the strength of the opposition. That’s a big part of the plan when we’re playing any opponent.” 19:03 , Mike Jones Arsenal XI: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Lewis-Skelly; Rice, Partey, Odegaard; Martinelli, Havertz, Trossard 🔴 𝗧𝗘𝗔𝗠𝙉𝙀𝙒𝙎 ⚪️🔙 Timber returns from suspension🪄 Trossard on the wing🙌 Havertz leads the lineLet's show our character, Gunners ✊ — Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 7, 2025 19:02 , Mike Jones Newcastle XI: Dubravka; Livramento, Botman, Burn, Hall; Willock, Tonali, Joelinton; Murphy, Isak, Gordon. HOWAY THE LADS! ✊ pic.twitter.com/RYeRuXfJ6S — Newcastle United (@NUFC) January 7, 2025 18:55 , Mike Jones Newcastle boss Eddie Howe does not care what people outside of the city think of his team as he plots another assault on Carabao Cup glory. The Magpies have climbed to fifth in the Premier League after a run of five successive victories, two of them at Manchester United and Tottenham, to rekindle memories of their surge into the Champions League places two seasons ago. Gunners boss Mikel Arteta and then Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp were angered by Newcastle’s approach during that campaign, prompting Howe to say: “We are not here to be popular and to get other teams to like us. We are here to compete.” Eddie Howe hits back at critics of Newcastle’s approach: ‘We are here to win’ 18:50 , Mike Jones Arsenal have progressed from three of their last five League Cup semi-final ties. However, they haven’t won the first leg in any of their last seven semi-finals in the competition. Can Newcastle take advantage of that tonight? 18:46 , Mike Jones Arsenal have won all four of their League Cup meetings with Newcastle, scoring 12 goals and conceding none. The last such match was a 4-0 win at St James’ Park in the 2010/11 fourth round. 18:40 , Mike Jones Here’s Eddie Howe chatting about the fitness of Newcastle defender Sven Botman who has recently returned from injury: “He feels good. Naturally, a little bit of fatigue at the end of the game [versus Spurs] but I think, with Sven, it was a long absence but he’s trained for a long, long time for this moment. “After the Aston Villa game, he was cleared to play but we wanted to give him longer to try and reach his best physical levels. It is not like he has been rushed back. Straight into action, he did very well, (I was) really pleased with him and he handled the intensity well.” 18:35 , Mike Jones The Newcastle manager knows how important these next two games will be for his team and hopes his players are ‘at their absolute best’ when they take on Arsenal tonight. Howe said: “This is an important game for us. We need to be at our absolute best, a high-level game. There is a lot at stake for us. “We’ve got to be really good off the ball and solid defensively. We’ve got to cause Arsenal problems the other way. I don’t think we should overthink it, we just need to get that mix right. “Let’s try and continue the good performances we’ve given recently and try and win the game.” 18:30 , Mike Jones Ahead of the game the Arsenal boss said: “We’re very excited to play the game in front of our crowd. “A semi-final, an opportunity to earn the right to be in a final and that starts tomorrow with two legs. Obviously they’re going to be two long games against a very competitive team, we know that, but very excited and we need a big, big atmosphere in our stadium. “The way we can feel at the Emirates with our people is incredible and I’m very positive that tomorrow we’re going to create a big one against really good opposition in the semi-final of the cup that we want to win, so let’s go for it.” 18:25 , Mike Jones Arsenal host Newcastle in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final on Tuesday night, with both sides looking to take what could be a vital advantage to St James’ Park (8pm, Sky Sports Main Event). The Gunners remain firmly in the Premier League title race after the weekend’s results, but attention turns to the first cup competition of the season as Mikel Arteta’s side hunt a first major trophy since 2020. Arsenal will know how difficult a second leg at St James’ could be, having lost there already this season, and will be desperate to take a lead of any kind to Tyneside, but they face a Newcastle team that has been in fine form in recent weeks, having won their last six matches in all competitions. Arsenal vs Newcastle prediction: Semi-final stalemate 18:20 , Mike Jones Referees will make in-stadium announcements on the outcome of VAR reviews in the remainder of this season’s Carabao Cup, marking a first for English football. The EFL confirmed last month that VAR will be in use for the competition’s two-leg semi-finals and for the final at Wembley on 16 March. However, the most significant move will be a pilot allowing referees to announce the final outcome of VAR reviews to spectators in the stadium and viewers watching at home. This will include decisions reviewed by the referee at the pitchside monitor, or upon the conclusion of factual matters such as accidental handball by a goalscorer or offside judgements. 18:15 , Mike Jones Here’s the team that will take to the field to officiate tonight’s semi-final first leg. Craig Pawson is in charge on the pitch and will referee the game while John Brooks is the VAR overseeing the new rules for the match. Referee: Craig PawsonAssistants: Ian Hussin, Wade SmithFourth official: Tony HarringtonVAR: John Brooks 18:10 , Mike Jones Arsenal suffered another selection setback after teen sensation Ethan Nwaneri was ruled out for the rest of the month on the eve of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Newcastle. The 17-year-old marked his second successive Premier League start by opening the scoring in Saturday’s 1-1 draw at Brighton before being withdrawn at half-time. Nwaneri was handed his chance as a result of injuries to Bukayo Saka, who is expected to be sidelined until March, and Raheem Sterling. But manager Mikel Arteta now faces being without the teenager for the entirety of January, with Tuesday’s first leg against the Magpies the first of seven fixtures to come during the remainder of the month. 18:05 , Mike Jones Arsenal have been dealt another injury blow with young star Ethan Nwaneri facing a spell on the sidelines. The 17-year-old has impressed of late having been handed an opportunity in the starting side after Bukayo Saka’s hamstring issue. But the teenager sustained a muscular problem in the weekend draw at Brighton and now faces time out. Arsenal suffer another injury blow with young star set for spell on sidelines 18:00 , Mike Jones Arsenal have been struggling for goals in recent weeks, while Newcastle have six wins on the bounce having scored 18 goals across those games. The Magpies will come up against one of the toughest defences in the country, but they’ll be confident of taking a result back to St James’ Park. Arsenal 1-1 Newcastle United. 17:55 , Mike Jones For Newcastle, Sven Botman made his return at the weekend, though he was forced off and so will likely not be risked in this match, with Lewis Kelly potentially coming in. The rest of the line-up will likely remain the same as it was for the win over Spurs, with Harvey Barnes and Joe Willock also fighting for a place. Predicted Newcastle XI: Dubravka; Livramento, Kelly, Burn, Hall; Guimaraes, Tonali, Joelinton; Murphy, Isak, Gordon. 17:50 , Mike Jones Arsenal have no new injury concerns after the draw with Brighton, though they can expect Kai Havertz back into the squad after he was out ill. In addition, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli could return to the starting 11 after being on the bench at the weekend. The midfield will likely stay similar to the trio used against Brighton, though Merino could drop out for Odegaard, and the defence will likely be the same too, with Riccardo Calafiori keeping his place ahead of Miles Lewis-Skelly. Predicted Arsenal XI: Raya; Partey, Gabriel, Saliba, Calafiori; Odegaard, Jorginho, Rice; Martinelli, Jesus, Trossard. 17:45 , Mike Jones Viewers in the United Kingdom have a couple of options for watching the match, as it will be shown live on both ITV1 and Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League.

Mikel Arteta’s side have been struggling for goals in recent weeks, with a disappointing draw with Brighton last time out meaning they’re now eight points adrift in the Premier League, but this competition provides a chance at some much-needed early silverware for the Gunners. And though Newcastle have been flying high in recent weeks, with six wins on the bounce, their well-publicised trophy drought means that another final in this tournament is arguably more important for Eddie Howe’s side. The Magpies last won a major trophy in 1955, when they won the FA Cup, and a win tonight would put one foot in their second Carabao Cup final in three seasons. 17:30 , Mike Jones Welcome to The Independent’s coverage of tonight’s Carabao Cup action as Arsenal host Newcastle in the first leg of tonight’s semi-final.

                "content": "League Cup Advertisement live Updated 4m ago Newcastle United will take a 2-0 advantage into the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Arsenal. Goals either side of half-time from Alexander Isak and then Anthony Gordon were enough to give Eddie Howe's side a commanding aggregate lead. Arsenal had plenty of chances to get themselves on the scoreline but were left wanting in front of goal again with Jurrien Timber, Gabriel Martinelli and Kai Havertz all missing big opportunities. The second leg of this tie will be played at St James' Park on Wednesday, February 5. Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here. GO FURTHER Arsenal 0 Newcastle 2 – Eddie Howe’s greatest feat yet? What next for Arsenal? Unfortunately, there is a long time to wait for the second leg of this one. That match, taking place at St James' Park, will be played on Wednesday, February 5. Less than 24 hours to wait for more Carabao Cup semi-final action, though, as the first leg between Tottenham and Liverpool comes your way at 8pm (GMT) tomorrow evening. As with all four semi-final matches, that will be covered live here on The Athletic. Advertisement After the match, Eddie Howe was asked about goalkeeper Martin Dubravka, who looked to be emotional and almost waving goodbye to fans at the end. He's been very heavily linked with Saudi Arabian club Al-Shabab. \"I've nothing to add to that,\" Howe said. \"We’ve been preparing for this game. He's been playing very well and I wouldn’t want to lose him.\" Pushed on it, he added: \"I know nothing, genuinely.\" He concluded \"that would be my wish,\" when asked if Dubravka could be offered a new contract and stay at the club. Getty Images Successive away wins for Newcastle at Manchester United's Old Trafford, Tottenham, and Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. What a week for a Newcastle supporter on the road! We have bemoaned Arsenal's lack of creativity on many an occasion this season, but that was not their downfall this evening. That fact, however, did not ease the frustration for Arteta. \"Obviously that isn't going to take the disappointment away,\" he said. \"The way the team tries every three days is unbelievable. And we have to be disappointed because it's another result that we wanted and that they don't deserve, but that's the reality.\" Asked about the challenge facing his players ahead of the second leg, the Arsenal boss was emphatic: \"I have full belief. I have seen my team play against them. I have full belief that we can do it.\" To me, these (spicy) two lines from Mikel Arteta's post-match interview detect some sore-loser-ship: \"Very deflected goals. Credit to them for managing to win the game like this.\" Hmm. I mean, the first goal was a good, possibly slightly fortuitous but probably intentional touch from Jacob Murphy into Alexander Isak's path. And Isak's shot took a slight nick on its way through to David Raya before Anthony Gordon tapped home, but it was really poor defending to allow Isak the shot. Not exactly 'two deflections'. And, seemingly a bit of back-handed compliment from Arteta in praising Newcastle for winning via those 'two deflections'. Getty Images No prizes for guessing the first question faced by Mikel Arteta in his post-match interview with Sky Sports — he was asked about the contrasting fortunes of the two teams in front of goal. \"That was the biggest difference in the game,\" he said. \"In every other aspect, we were the better team. But this is about scoring and they managed with the chances they had. And very deflected goals. Credit to them for managing to win the game like this. \"When we miss the chances we miss and concede those goals, it's always tough. But the team reacted and the team was very willing. We generated a lot of situations but it's true, they defended their box very well with their lives. \"They blocked a lot of shots, credit to them.\" Advertisement Getty Images Victorious Newcastle manager Eddie Howe, speaking to ITV after the game, said: \"Very pleased with the players, it was a tough game for us in many respects. We had players struggling at half-time. Really pleased with how we played. \"First half (Alexander Isak) was electric, he played really well. He scored but I just thought his general game was in a really good place. He was feeling his hamstring a bit at half-time so we had to manage him in the second half and that was a big blow to our performance. \"We rode our luck at times and I think Martin (Dubravka) played really well and made some really good saves. The set plays in the main we got the small details right. \"Our mentality to defend our goal with the blocked shots, the heroic pieces of defending that we saw in the last 20 to 30 minutes, it's great for us for the future.\" The Athletic/Getty Images Recognise that goal celebration from Anthony Gordon? A certain former Arsenal striker might remember it... Getty Images Captain for the evening Dan Burn turned in a performance worthy of the armband. He was asked about how he felt about the collective defensive showing. \"Very proud,\" he told Sky Sports. \"It was always going to be like that in the second half when we went two goals up. It's only half the job done but I thought everyone defended brilliantly. \"To get a result here, you have to defend set pieces well. They're so good at them. Everyone was brilliant. (Arsenal) had chances and probably deserved a goal, but throwing bodies on the line managed to get us over (the line).\" Since the 1987-1988 season, this is the ninth time that an away team has had a two-goal advantage going into the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg. On each and every one of the previous eight occasions, the side two goals up has progressed to the final. Hell of an ask for Arsenal to overturn this lead! Getty Images Another Player of the Match award for Alexander Isak and another modest post-match interview, this time with Sky Sports — he was asked about his blistering form in front of goal. \"It comes down to the team. We've been very solid defensively and then we have the quality up front,\" he said. \"It was again Jacob (Murphy) who assisted me today so I just tried to be in the right place to finish the attack.\" Asked about his partnership with Murphy, Isak said: \"We've found the connection in a good way. He gets into good positions and he seems to find me a lot which is positive for me and for the team as well.\" Advertisement Getty Images Newcastle goalscorer Anthony Gordon, speaking post-match to ITV, said: \"It's up there. We knew what type of game it would be, they're dominant at home. It was always going to be a smash-and-grab.\" When asked if team-mate Alexander Isak is the best striker in Europe, he continued: \"I think so. Everyone is in agreement with that. He's on fire. Even for my goal. I'm just gambling back post. \"It's all about attitude. It was unbelievable to a man. I want to mention Dan Burn, he's been our player of the season for me. \"We don't have time to be celebrating this one. They're one of the best sides in Europe, it's only 2-0. We need to stay humble.\" Getty Images Another monumental defensive performance from Eddie Howe's side. They are making quite the habit of keeping out their opponents — that is the fifth clean they have recorded in their last seven matches in all competitions. Only Yoane Wissa and Dominic Solanke (once each) have scored against Newcastle in that run of fixtures. It was a great all-around team performance from Newcastle. No real weak links. Goalkeeper Martin Dubravka was solid and strong when called upon in potentially his final game for the club. The full-backs, young and English, were good, especially Lewis Hall, who should be right in England contention. The centre-halves, led by Dan Burn, massive. Botman was good on his second match back from injury too. In midfield, Joelinton threw himself around with abandon, while Sandro Tonali was a colossus. Great clinical finishing and pressing from Isak and Gordon up front too, while Jacob Murphy is smart and underrated. The subs did their job too. Getty Images That is a really damaging result for Arsenal and Mikel Arteta. He has done a lot of good work during his time as manager at the Emirates, but his lack of silverware is hindering his chance of building a real legacy. He may well mastermind a second-leg turnaround, but tonight feels particularly damaging for the Spaniard. He could be staring another trophy-less season in the face... Getty Images That is among the most impressive of all Newcastle United wins during Eddie Howe's already extremely successful tenure. This not only marks seven successive wins in all competitions, but the last three of them have been achieved on the road at testing grounds. Arsenal missed some big chances, but Newcastle were excellent during the first half, efficient in front of goal and defensively resolute. A two-goal lead is an unexpected, and also a healthy, one to take back to St James' Park for next month's second leg. Newcastle's players were understandably muted afterwards, seemingly holding themselves back, recognising this is only 'half-time' in the tie. Regardless, this result is huge. There is no other way of describing it. Advertisement The Athletic's Chris Waugh and Art de Roche were on hand to deliver The Briefing from the Emirates Stadium — you can read it at the link below. GO FURTHER Arsenal 0 Newcastle 2 – Eddie Howe’s greatest feat yet? What next for Arsenal? That's seven wins on the spin for Newcastle. And eight matches successively in which Alexander Isak has scored. What a player! And what brilliant form Eddie Howe's men are in. Getty Images Put simply, that is a monumental win for Newcastle. They arrived at the Emirates Stadium in very good form, but there won't be too many of their fans who expected to see them come away from north London with a 2-0 first-leg win. Yes, Arsenal missed a host of big chances, but that was a seriously impressive display from Eddie Howe's men, particularly when they dropped in to protect their 2-0 lead. A huge result to take up north for next month's second leg!",

For Arsenal vs. Newcastle, Green is backing the match to end in a draw for a plus-money payout. The expert acknowledges that Newcastle is the healthier team and has been in top form over their current undefeated stretch.

                "title": "Sutton Foster - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Sutton Lenore Foster (born March 18, 1975) is an American actress. She is known for her work on the Broadway stage, for which she has won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical twice, in 2002 for her role as Millie Dillmount in Thoroughly Modern Millie, and in 2011 for her performance as Reno Sweeney in Anything Goes, a role which she reprised in 2021 for a production in London and for which she received a nomination for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical. Her other Broadway credits include Grease, Little Women, The Drowsy Chaperone, Young Frankenstein, Shrek the Musical, Violet, The Music Man, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and Once Upon a Mattress. On television, Foster played the lead role in the short-lived ABC Family comedy-drama Bunheads from 2012 to 2013. From 2015 to 2021, she starred in the TV Land comedy-drama Younger. Foster was born on March 18, 1975[1][2] in Statesboro, Georgia,[3] and raised in Troy, Michigan.[4] At the age of 15, she was a contestant on the reality competition show Star Search[4][5] and also auditioned for the cast of The Mickey Mouse Club. She left Troy High School before graduating (she received her diploma via correspondence courses) to join the national tour of The Will Rogers Follies directed by Tommy Tune.[4][6][7] She then attended Carnegie Mellon University for one year,[7][8] but left to pursue a theatrical career full-time. In May 2012, she received an honorary doctorate from Ball State University, \"in recognition of her outstanding career in theater, television and music and for her contributions to the educational experience and professional growth of Ball State students.\"[9] In May 2019, she also received an honorary doctorate from Boston Conservatory at Berklee, which introduced a merit scholarship in her name to be awarded to one student every four years. Her older brother, Hunter Foster, is also an actor.[4][7] After touring in the role of Sandy Dumbrowski in the musical Grease throughout 1995, Foster transferred to the Broadway production in 1996.[10][11] She left to appear in the ensemble of the Broadway musical The Scarlet Pimpernel in 1997, and after that closed[12] she returned as the Star to Be in the revival of Annie. In 1998, Foster appeared in What the World Needs Now at the Old Globe Theatre, before she began touring with Les Misérables as Eponine Thenardier. She then understudied the same role on Broadway in 2000.[13] Foster left Les Misérables to join the ensemble of Thoroughly Modern Millie in its pre-Broadway run at the La Jolla Playhouse. Original leading lady Kristin Chenoweth landed a television series shortly after rehearsals began and was replaced with Erin Dilly as Millie and Foster as her understudy. After apparent clashes between the creative team, a \"mutual\" decision was made for Dilly to leave the production. With only nine days remaining before the first preview, Foster took over the role of Millie Dilmount.[14][15] During a hiatus (before Millie was set to open on Broadway), Foster appeared in Dorian at Goodspeed Musicals, The Three Musketeers at the American Musical Theatre of San Jose, and South Pacific at the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera.[citation needed] Thoroughly Modern Millie finally opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in 2002, to positive reviews. The New York Daily News reviewer said: \"newcomer Sutton Foster, who has the pert look, the silver voice and the dazzling legwork to make an extraordinarily winning Millie.\"[16] Clive Barnes, reviewing for the New York Post wrote \"Newcomer Sutton Foster's own star turn as Millie is perfectly charming, but as a star she doesn't twinkle, glitter or light up Broadway like a Christmas tree defying a July noon. But she has a good voice and is cutely agreeable.\"[17] The Newsday reviewer wrote: \"She has a smile that may remind you of Mary Tyler Moore, the gawky comic precision of the young Carol Burnett, the lyricism of a romantic heroine and a smallish but vibrant voice as accurate as it is expressive. As [Millie], another of New York's prototypical small-town girls with big-city dreams, [Sutton Foster] appears unfazed by the burden of a character created onscreen by Julie Andrews. The newcomer takes the big stage with an uninhibited what-the-heck comfort level and the discipline to go with her instincts.\"[18] Time Magazine wrote: \"she's [Sutton Foster] got the full package: girlish gawkiness and Broadway brass, the legs and the lungs. Foster is a big reason the show is just about the cutest thing to hit Broadway since Annie's dimples, with perkily retro songs by Jeanine Tesori and clever staging by director Michael Mayer...\"[19] Foster went on to win the 2002 Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical,[20] the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical,[21] and the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical for her performance.[22][23] During the run, Foster appeared in concert versions of Chess and Funny Girl, before leaving in 2004. Upon leaving, Foster did a concert version of Snoopy! The Musical and returned to the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera for a production of Me and My Girl to wrap up the year. In May 2005, Foster co-starred as Jo March opposite Maureen McGovern as Marmee in the musical adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel Little Women, for which she was nominated for her second Tony Award.[24] The production closed after just a few months. She returned to Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in May 2006 in The Drowsy Chaperone, a spoof of 1920s musicals. She played Janet van de Graaff, a famous Broadway starlet who opts to forgo a stage career in favor of married life. The musical had a pre-Broadway run at the Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles in November to December 2005.[25] Her performance earned her a third Tony nomination.[26] Foster left the musical in 2007 and co-starred in Mel Brooks' musical adaptation of his film Young Frankenstein as the Swedish yodeling fräulein Inga, first at the Paramount Theatre and then on Broadway from October 2007 to July 2008.[27] In 2007, Foster guest-starred on the children's musical puppet show Johnny and the Sprites[28] and in a three-episode story arc on the HBO sitcom Flight of the Conchords.[29] She left the show to play Princess Fiona in Shrek the Musical, which opened on Broadway on December 14, 2008.[30] For this role, Foster won her second Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical[31] and was nominated for her fourth Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical.[32] She played her final performance on January 3, 2010, when the show closed on Broadway. Foster participated in a reading of a work-in-progress new musical, Bonnie and Clyde: A Folktale, in June 2009. Her brother, Hunter is writing the music for this musical.[33] Foster's debut solo album Wish was released by Ghostlight Records in February 2009. The songs range from jazz to pop to cabaret to Broadway.[34] In 2010, Foster promoted the album with concert performances in Boston, New York City, Chicago, the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Orange County, California, and Washington, D.C.[35] Foster starred as Nurse Fay Apple in the New York City Center's Encores! production of Anyone Can Whistle, which played from April 8 to 11, 2010.[36] Foster made her Off-Broadway debut in Paul Weitz's comedy Trust with Zach Braff, Bobby Cannavale and Ari Graynor which began previews July 23, 2010, with an official opening August 12, running through September 12, 2010, at Second Stage Theatre.[37] Foster and Seth Rudetsky participated in the one night only Actors Fund benefit concert version of They're Playing Our Song on August 30, 2010, at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater, John Jay College, New York. The full cast included Efé, Kaitlyn Davidson, Alex Ellis, Maynard, Matt Loehr, and Jesse Nager, and was directed by Denis Jones.[38] Foster taught a Spring Semester master class at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts Undergraduate Department of Drama, beginning in January 2010. It culminated in a cabaret performance at Joe's Pub in May titled \"From Rodgers To Heart\".[39][40] She taught the master class again in Fall Semester 2010, culminating in another performance at Joe's Pub, \"Crazy for Gershwin\". Both were musically directed by Deborah Abramson. She is now on the faculty of NYU's New Studio on Broadway. Foster taught a week-long master class session at Ball State University (Muncie, IN) in January 2010.[33] She continued her relationship with Ball State in September 2010 by working with students in the classroom, teaching master classes, and performing workshops for students of the Department of Theatre and Dance. She also guest-starred in an episode of the NBC legal drama Law & Order: SVU (opposite comedian Kathy Griffin), which aired on March 3, 2010.[41] Foster performed at the 33rd Annual Kennedy Center Honors in a tribute to Jerry Herman, singing \"Before the Parade Passes By.\"[42] She performed at the Kennedy Center Honors the following year in a tribute to Barbara Cook.[43] She made a third appearance at the Kennedy Center Honors in 2013, performing for the tribute to Shirley MacLaine.[44] Foster performed a concert tour, An Evening With Sutton Foster from September 2010 to May 2011, performing songs from both her Broadway career and her solo album.[45] Foster played Reno Sweeney in the Broadway revival of Anything Goes, which began performances on March 10, 2011, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre and officially opened on April 7, 2011.[46] Foster won her third Outer Critics Circle Award and second Drama Desk Award and Tony Award for her performance.[47][48][49] Foster's final performance was on March 11, 2012, when she was replaced by Stephanie J. Block. Foster left to film the television comedy-drama Bunheads, which premiered on ABC Family on June 11, 2012.[50][51] Foster played the lead role in this short-lived 2012 ABC Family drama, developed by Amy Sherman-Palladino, the creator of Gilmore Girls. She played former Las Vegas showgirl Michelle, who impulsively marries a man, moves to his small town, and begins teaching ballet lessons at her new mother-in-law's dance studio. She won the Gracie Award and received a nomination at the 3rd Critics' Choice Television Awards for Best Actress in a Comedy Series.[52] The series was cancelled after a single season.[53] In the spring of 2012, she returned to Ball State, teaching classes, mentoring the interdisciplinary team that wrote the musical The Circus in Winter, and co-directing the Department of Theatre and Dance's Spring 2012 production of The Drowsy Chaperone; she also spoke at commencement and received an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts degree for her continued engagement with Ball State students. Foster continued her relationship with Ball State in October 2012, performing in the staged reading of The Circus in Winter at the National Alliance for Musical Theatre's Festival of New Musicals at New World Stages in New York.[54] In 2013, Foster guest starred in an episode of Psych and starred as Kerry in actor James Roday's comedic thriller Gravy.[55] In 2014, she appeared opposite Robin Williams in the comedy The Angriest Man in Brooklyn.[56] From March to August 2014, Foster starred in the Roundabout Theatre Company production of the musical Violet at the American Airlines Theatre.[57] Foster received her sixth Tony Award nomination for her performance.[58] She made her Carnegie Hall debut in April 2015, with guest appearances from Joshua Henry and Megan McGinnis.[59][60] This was part of a new tour effort An Evening With Sutton Foster: Broadway In Concert, which continued through 2016. She returned to Encores! in July 2015 to play Queenie in Andrew Lippa's The Wild Party.[61] She later was cast as the lead character of Liza Miller in the TV Land single-camera comedy-drama pilot Younger, created by Darren Star. It was originally set to be released January 13, 2015, but she stated on January 31 in an interview at TETA TheatreFest 2015 in Houston, Texas that the release was delayed. The series premiered on March 31, 2015, and was renewed for a second season, which began airing in January 2016, shortly after it was renewed for a third season, set for a release at the end of the year. In July 2016, season three began filming, and the series was renewed for a fourth season.[56][62] Season three aired to positive reviews in late 2016, and season 4 aired in summer 2017 with further positive reviews. In 2016, she starred opposite Aaron Tveit and Betty Buckley in the Stephen Schwartz revue Defying Gravity in Australia. She appeared in the Off-Broadway revival of Sweet Charity as Charity Hope Valentine at the Pershing Square Signature Center from November 2, 2016 (previews) to January 8, 2017.[63][64] Also in 2016, Foster played the role of Violet in the miniseries Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life opposite her ex-husband, Christian Borle.

In 2017, she once again returned to Ball State, this time to co-direct the Department of Theatre and Dance's Spring production of Shrek: The Musical.[67] During December 2017, she performed as a guest artist for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir's annual Christmas concerts.[68] In December 2017, Foster and Jonathan Groff performed a selection of songs from many shows at The Appel Room at Lincoln Center;[69] this concert, which also featured Megan McGinnis and Darcie Roberts, aired on PBS's \"Live From Lincoln Center\" on April 20, 2018.[70][71] From July through October 2021, Foster made her London theatre debut reprising her role as Reno Sweeney[72] in Anything Goes at the Barbican Theatre, earning rave reviews from British critics.[73][74][75] For her performance, Foster was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical.[76] The production was broadcast in UK cinemas on 28 November and 1 December 2021.[77] The recorded performance also played at US cinemas on March 27 and 30, 2022, and later aired on the PBS series Great Performances.[78][79] In October 2021, she published a memoir, Hooked, in which she opens up about how she used crafts, specifically cross-stitching, collaging and crocheting, to get through significantly challenging milestones in her life. She shares how using crafts as creative outlets helped her deal with painful experiences in her life and remain present and resilient.

                "title": "What does TGL stand for? An investigation (with a surprising twist)",
                "content": "Make 2025 your best golf year ever: The TGL on opening night. Getty Images Earlier this week, as I was trying to explain the inception of another new golf league to a non-golfing buddy, he asked a very reasonable question: What does TGL stand for? He didn’t mean stand for existentially, like, what does TGL represent, who does it champion, what are its values. He just meant, very literally, what do the letters in the acronym TGL stand for? The NBA is the National Basketball Association. The NFL is the National Football League. The MLB is Major League Baseball. What’s the TGL? And I realized that I did not have an answer. The G and the L were, I could safely assume, referencing a “Golf League.” But how ’bout the T? I thought back to the first time we heard about this new golf thing, in a press conference at the 2022 Tour Championship. It was LIV’s debut summer, a turbulent time for the PGA Tour and for professional golf, but Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods had led a charge to stabilize the Tour and now, as added incentive, were introducing a new company and a new-look golf league. At East Lake, McIlroy brought up CEO and co-founder Mike McCarley to make the official introduction of two new entities: TMRW Sports (the company) and TGL (the league). I remember the uncertainty at the time: What on earth are these? But I didn’t remember much else. Had McCarley explained ’em then? I pulled up the transcript to see if he’d gone deep on the acronyms, but no dice — he was intentionally and understandably vague. Forget TGL; it wasn’t even quite clear what TMRW was. Sure, they were were the initials of Tiger Woods (TW) and Rory McIlroy (RM) put together. We learned a little while later that it was pronounced “tomorrow.” But the rest we’d have to piece together ourselves. There were multiple possibilities. McCarley kept calling it a “tech-infused” golf league. Was that the T in TGL? Hopefully not. Did the T refer to golf’s most famous T and we were witnessing the launch of the Tiger Golf League or Tiger’s Golf League or something along those lines? That would be a little on the nose. The most logical explanation was that it was the TMRW Golf League, abbreviating one vague acronym to squeeze it into another. But that would require multiple layers of explanation and, if it was the case, I’d never seen it written anywhere. I pulled up the TGL website. Any explanation was conspicuously absent and the league was described only by its three letters. Actually, that’s not true. On its site and really in all press-release materials you’ll find “TGL presented by SoFi” which appears to be the official name. An easy dig to make at the league’s expense would be that, in classic golf fashion, they figured out the sponsor before they figured out the league. But it’s Week 1! We’re feeling warm and fuzzy about their creative golf innovation — no need for cheap shots. Surely Google would know. Somebody else would have asked the question and found the answer. And they had — sort of. Several outlets had addressed it, but I saw multiple references to the TGL as “Tomorrow’s Golf League.” The New York Times described it that way. So did ESPN, which added that the inclusion of “Tomorrow” in the name “stems from” TMRW. Even Wikipedia added the “Tomorrow’s” reference. I get the imagery of tomorrow, which lends itself to a forward-thinking league focused on starting something new and different. But framing it as tomorrow’s league in perpetuity? That introduces a bit of a Dippin’ Dots problem. If you’re the ice cream of the future — or, in this case, the golf league of tomorrow — what happens when you want to be the golf league of today? USA Today introduced more nuance in its explainer, writing that TGL “unofficially” stands for Tomorrow’s Golf League. That felt better. I’ve been on the receiving end of enough TGL media materials that I figure I would have seen some reference to “Tomorrow’s” if it’d been made official, but no. Finally I found an interview with McCarley in the Palm Beach Post where he’d been confronted directly with the question and laid out the truth. “You go through a bunch of different branding exercises with different agencies and at the end of it what you find is if you’re creating a sports league, everyone uses the acronym anyway,” McCarley said. “So start with the acronym because that’s what it’s eventually going to be called once people start to realize what it is and how they refer to it.” In other words, McCarley and co. had settled on TGL before they’d even settled on T. He considered the same questions we did. Tiger Golf League? Tech golf league? Simply The Golf League? Ultimately perhaps he decided it didn’t much matter. He’s probably right that a full name is mostly pointless; only long-winded broadcasters ever reference the “National Football League,” after all. Still, it helps define the league. There’s something foundational about its existence. But when I finally got in touch with a league employee, that person confirmed the unsettling truth: TGL just stands for TGL. I didn’t like that. Acronyms are by definition abbreviations, and it’s unnatural to skip the step of having something to abbreviate. Another league would never do this, I thought to myself. And then I realized, wait a minute — what if the PGA Tour already does? You may or may not know that the current Tour was once part of the Professional Golfers’ Association of America. That’s where “PGA” originated. But somewhere after the entities split, things got murky. One sign of this murkiness: In 1981 the league even changed its name to the Tournament Players Association, to be known as the TPA Tour, to avoid confusion, but then changed it back a few months later. Perhaps that’s where the acronym lost its filling, I’m not sure — but I confirmed with multiple Tour employees that, to their knowledge, the PGA Tour at this point isn’t short for anything. That’s the complete thing. For the first time in years, a scene popped into my head from the 2004 high-schoolers-steal-the-SAT-answers epic film The Perfect Score, which my family had owned on DVD and thus cycled through several times on road trips. At one point in the movie Kyle (played by Chris Evans) asks Matty (Bryan Greenberg) what he thinks SAT even stands for. “[It used to be] Scholastic Aptitude Test,” Kyle says. “Then they got rid of that altogether. You know what it stands for now?” “Hmph.“ “SAT.“ “What?“ “SAT stands for SAT. That’s it.” “That’s f—- up!” For the record, that’s true: the SAT no longer stands for anything. It’s just the SAT, full stop. But we already know, for better or worse, what the SAT is. With the TGL, we’re just starting to find out. And once we do, the name won’t much matter anymore, anyway.

                "content": "Occupational Group Life Insurance (TGL) is a life insurance that your employer pays for. TGL provides your beneficiaries basic financial protection if you were to die before you retire or reach the age of expiry. Contact your employer to find out whether you have TGL cover or not. A full amount of compensation corresponds to six price base amounts. Payment is age-dependent and reduces the older you get. If you have children who have not reached the age of 20 at the time of your death, each child will receive additional compensation. You can see the current applicable amount of compensation in the pre-purchase information. The insurance applies as long as you are employed and will cease when you retire. If you continue working after the age of 65, the insurance will automatically cease when you reach 'the age of expiry', which usually is the age of 70. All life insurance policies have a fixed order of priority regarding the beneficiaries in the terms and conditions. If you would like to change this order, you have to do this with a special form called ‘nomination of beneficiary’ (särskilt förmånstagarförordnande). The following priority of beneficiaries applies to TGL within the collective agreement area for the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise and The Council for Negotiation and Cooperation (Svenskt Näringsliv and PTK): Half a price base amount is paid out to your estate if none of the above is alive and no separate nomination of beneficiary has been registered.

                "title": "Peter Yarrow - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Peter Yarrow (May 31, 1938 – January 7, 2025) was an American singer and songwriter who found fame as a member of the 1960s folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary. Yarrow co-wrote (with Lenny Lipton) one of the group's best known hits, \"Puff, the Magic Dragon.\" He was also a political activist and supported causes that ranged from opposition to the Vietnam War to school anti-bullying programs. Yarrow was convicted in 1970 of molesting a 14-year-old girl, for which he was pardoned in 1981 by President Jimmy Carter. Peter Yarrow was born in Manhattan on May 31, 1938, the son of Vera Wisebrode (née Vira Burtakoff) and Bernard Yarrow. His parents were educated Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, whose families had settled in Providence, Rhode Island.[1] Bernard Yarrow (1899–1973) attended the Jagiellonian University (Kraków) and the Odesa University (Odesa) before emigrating to the United States in 1922, at age 23.[2] He anglicized his surname from Yaroshevitz to Yarrow, obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in 1925 from Columbia University, where he joined Phi Sigma Delta fraternity,[3] and graduated from Columbia Law School in 1928. He then maintained a private law practice in New York City until 1938, when he was appointed an assistant district attorney under Thomas E. Dewey. In 1944, he was recruited into the Office of Strategic Services, where he served with distinction.[4] After the war, Bernard joined Sullivan & Cromwell, the Dulles brothers' law firm.[5] He was a founding board member of the National Committee for a Free Europe, an anti-Communist organization. In 1952, he became a senior vice-president of the CIA-funded Radio Free Europe, an organization he helped found.[6] Yarrow's mother, Vera (1904–1991), who had come to America at age three, became a speech and drama teacher at New York's Julia Richman Education Complex for girls. She and Bernard divorced in 1943, when their son Peter was five, and Vera subsequently married Harold Wisebrode, the executive director of the Central Synagogue in Manhattan.[7] Bernard married his wartime London OSS partner Silvia Tim, and converted to Protestantism.[8] Peter spent the summers of 1951 and 1952 at Interlochen's Music camp. He graduated second in his class among male students from New York's High School of Music and Art, where he had studied painting and received a physics prize. He was accepted at Cornell University, where he began as a physics major but soon switched to psychology, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1959.[1] Among his Cornell classmates were Lenny Lipton, Thomas Pynchon, Richard Fariña, Jack Sarfatti, Judith Bellemore, C. Michael Curtis and David Shetzline.[citation needed] Yarrow began singing in public during his last year at Cornell while participating in Harold Thompson's popular American Folk Literature course, colloquially known on campus as \"Romp-n-Stomp.\" The course was \"a highlight of late-1950s student life at Cornell,\" Yarrow later recalled, and singing and guitar-playing skills were prerequisites for enrollment.[9] Thompson would lecture on a given topic for 20 or 30 minutes and afterwards a student would sing songs related to his theme. The experience of performing before a large audience was thrilling for Yarrow, who discovered he loved it. He branched out to lead community sings on weekends.[citation needed] Upon graduation, Yarrow played in New York City folk clubs, appeared on the CBS television show Folk Sound USA, and performed at the Newport Folk Festival, where he met manager and musical impresario Albert Grossman.[10] One day, the two were at Israel Young's Folklore Center in Greenwich Village discussing Grossman's idea for a new group that would be \"an updated version of the Weavers for the baby-boom generation ... with the crossover appeal of The Kingston Trio.\" Yarrow noticed a picture of Mary Travers on the wall and asked Grossman who she was. \"That's Mary Travers,\" Grossman said. \"She'd be good if you could get her to work.\"[11] The lanky, blonde Kentucky-born Travers was well connected in Greenwich Village folk circles. While still a student at the progressive Elizabeth Irwin High School, she had been selected by Elizabeth Irwin's chorus leader, Robert De Cormier, to join \"The Song Swappers\" trio in backing up Pete Seeger in the 1955 Folkways LP reissue of the Almanac Singers' The Talking Union and two other albums. In addition to performing twice with Seeger at Carnegie Hall, Travers had performed the role of a folksinger in The Next President, a short-lived Broadway play, starring satirist Mort Sahl, but she was known to be painfully introverted and loath to sing professionally.[12] To draw Travers out, Yarrow went to her apartment on MacDougal Street, across from the Gaslight Cafe, one of the principal folk clubs. They harmonized on 'Miner's Lifeguard,' a union song, and decided that their voices blended well. To fill out the trio, Travers suggested Noel Stookey, a friend doing folk music and stand-up comedy at the Gaslight. They chose the catchy \"Peter, Paul and Mary\" as the name for their group, since Noel Stookey's middle name was Paul, and rehearsed intensively for six months, touring outside New York before debuting in 1961 as a polished act at The Bitter End nightclub in Greenwich Village. There, the singers quickly developed a following and signed a contract with Warner Brothers.[12] Warner released Peter, Paul and Mary's \"Lemon Tree\" as a single in early 1962. The trio then released \"If I Had a Hammer,\" a 1949 song by Pete Seeger and Lee Hays, written to protest the imprisonment of Harlem City Councilman Benjamin J. Davis, Jr. under the Smith Act. \"If I had a Hammer\" garnered two Grammy Awards in 1962. The trio's first album, the eponymous Peter, Paul & Mary, remained in the Top 10 for ten months and in the Top 20 for two years; it sold more than two million copies. The group toured extensively and recorded numerous albums, both live and in the studio.[13][14] In June 1963, Peter, Paul and Mary released a 7\" single of \"Blowin' in the Wind\" by the then-relatively unknown Bob Dylan, who was also managed by Grossman. \"Blowin' in the Wind\" sold 300,000 copies in the first week of release; by August 17, it was number two on the Billboard pop chart, with sales exceeding one million copies. Yarrow recalled that when he told Dylan he would make more than $5,000 (equivalent to $50,000 in 2023[15]) from the publishing rights, Dylan was speechless.[16] On August 28, 1963, Peter, Paul and Mary appeared on stage with the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. at his historic March on Washington where their performance of \"Blowin' in the Wind\" established it as a civil rights anthem.[17] Their version also spent weeks on Billboard's easy listening chart. By 1964 the 26-year-old Yarrow had joined the Board of the Newport Folk Festival, where he had performed as an unknown just four years earlier.[18] Yarrow's songwriting helped to create some of Peter, Paul and Mary's best-known songs, including \"Puff, the Magic Dragon\", \"Day Is Done\", \"Light One Candle\", and \"The Great Mandala\". As a member of the trio, he earned a 1996 Emmy nomination for the Great Performances special LifeLines Live, a highly acclaimed celebration of folk music, with their musical mentors, contemporaries, and a new generation of singer-songwriters.[19] Yarrow was instrumental in founding the New Folks Concert series at both the Newport Folk Festival and the Kerrville Folk Festival.[20] His work at Kerrville has been called his \"most important achievement in this arena\".[21] Yarrow co-wrote and produced \"Torn Between Two Lovers\", a number one hit for Mary McGregor. He also produced three CBS TV specials based on \"Puff, the Magic Dragon,\" which earned an Emmy nomination for him. In 1978 Yarrow organized Survival Sunday, an antinuclear benefit, and after a period of separation, he was once again joined by Stookey and Travers.[22] Yarrow and his daughter, Bethany Yarrow, often performed together. Together with cellist Rufus Cappadocia, they formed the trio Peter, Bethany, and Rufus.[23] They released the CD Puff & Other Family Classics. In 2008, the musical special Peter, Bethany & Rufus: Spirit of Woodstock, featuring a live performance of the band, aired on public television.[24] Yarrow portrayed leftist intellectual Ira Mandelstam in the 2015 film While We're Young.[25][26] Yarrow had long been an activist for social and political causes. What he did was not always popular. According to The New York Times: As their fame grew, Peter, Paul and Mary mixed music with political and social activism. The trio marched with Martin Luther King Jr. in Washington, D.C., in 1963 and in Selma, Alabama, in 1965. The three participated in countless demonstrations against the war in Vietnam. They sang at the 1969 March on Washington, which Mr. Yarrow helped to organize. Though their activism provoked a steady stream of death threats, they were never harmed. \"But for years, I used to bite my fingernails on stage,\" [Mary] Travers says. \"There you are and look like the back porch light, and stare out at 12,000 or 15,000 people. Any one of whom could have had a gun.\"[27] In 2000, in an effort to combat school bullying, Yarrow helped start Operation Respect,[28] a nonprofit organization that brings to children, in schools and camps, a curriculum of tolerance and respect for each other's differences. The project began as a result of Yarrow and his daughter Bethany and his son Christopher having heard the song Don't Laugh at Me (written by Steve Seskin and Allen Shamblin) at the Kerrville Folk Festival.[29][30][31] In March 2008, Yarrow told Reuters: Operation Respect has been my main and all-consuming work for the past 10 years. My perception is that the kind of bullying, humiliation that goes on in children's schools leads to high rates of depression that was virtually unknown when I was young and the high suicide rate of teenagers which we know is almost inevitably caused by bullying or mean-spiritedness. It is a reflection of the role models that young people observe on TV shows like a lot of the reality shows. It is also part and parcel of the characteristics in the adult world of America.[32] Yarrow's leadership in the campaign to free Soviet Jewry inspired another generation. Of the song \"Light One Candle\", Rabbi Allison Bergman Vann wrote: Peter Yarrow's now famous song, which was written in 1983, became a defining song for my generation of high school and college students to become activists, to make the world a better place. I heard Peter Yarrow singing that song on the steps of the Capitol, in 1987, twenty years ago next week, during the march to free Soviet Jews. Listening to him sing, surrounded by literally thousands of like-minded individuals, I learned of my obligation to change the world; to engage in tikkun olam, repair of our broken world. And, during that incredible day, I knew that we could, indeed, change the world.[33][better source needed] In 2005, Yarrow performed in Ho Chi Minh City at a concert to benefit the Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange; Yarrow pleaded with the Vietnamese for forgiveness of the United States.[34] Yarrow served on the board of directors of the Connecticut Hospice.[21][35][better source needed] On November 1, 2008, Yarrow performed across New York City for volunteers who worked for the presidential campaign of Senator Barack Obama.[36] On October 3, 2011, Yarrow, his son, and his daughter made an appearance at Zuccotti Park during the Occupy Wall Street protests, playing songs such as \"We Shall Not Be Moved\" and a variation of \"Puff the Magic Dragon\".[37][38] Yarrow was a member of Braver Angels.[39] Yarrow cited Judaism as one of the roots of his liberal views.[40] While campaigning for 1968 presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy, Yarrow met McCarthy's niece, Mary Beth McCarthy, in Wisconsin. He was 31, she was 20.[41][42] They were married in October 1969[40] in Willmar, Minnesota. Paul Stookey wrote \"Wedding Song (There Is Love)\" as his gift for their wedding and first performed it at St. Mary's Church in Willmar. They had two children, son Christopher and daughter Bethany,[43][44] but later divorced.[45] At the time of Yarrow's death, it was revealed that he and Mary Beth remarried in 2022 and remained married until his death in 2025.[43][46] In December 2000, Yarrow's Larrivee acoustic guitar was stolen on an airplane flight. In early 2005, fans spotted the guitar on eBay. The FBI recovered it in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, and returned it to Yarrow. He did not press charges, as the person from whom it was recovered was not the person who had stolen it.[47] Yarrow performed the world premiere of \"The Colonoscopy Song\" on the CBS early morning program The Early Show on March 9, 2010.[48] Yarrow acknowledged being an alcoholic, and sought treatment for the disease. He considered himself in recovery.[49] A longtime resident of New York City, Yarrow had also owned a vacation home in Telluride, Colorado. Yarrow's son, Christopher, is a visual artist who in the late 2000s owned an emporium in Portland, Oregon, named The Monkey & The Rat.[50] In 1970, Yarrow was convicted and served three months in prison for taking \"improper liberties\" with 14-year-old Barbara Winter. In August 1969, she had gone with her 17-year-old sister to Yarrow's hotel room in Washington, DC seeking an autograph. Winter stated that Yarrow answered the door naked and made her masturbate him until he ejaculated. Yarrow served three months of a 1–3 year prison sentence.[51][52][53][54][55] He apologized for the incident, saying that \"it was an era of real indiscretion and mistakes by categorically male performers. I was one of them. I got nailed. I was wrong. I'm sorry for it.\"[52] Yarrow was granted a presidential pardon by Jimmy Carter on January 19, 1981, the day before Carter's presidency ended.[51][52][56] For decades, Yarrow avoided mention of the assault, but by the early 2000s, it became a campaign issue for politicians he supported.[54][57][58] In 2004, U.S. Representative Martin Frost of Texas, a Democrat, canceled a fundraising appearance with Yarrow after his opponent ran a radio advertisement about Yarrow's offense;[54] in 2013, Republican politicians in New York called on Democratic congressional candidate Martha Robertson to cancel a scheduled fundraiser with Yarrow.[57][59] In 2019, he was disinvited from a folk music festival when the organizers were informed of his conviction.[60] In May 2021, The Washington Post wrote that \"[Yarrow's] pardon by Carter — perhaps the only one in U.S. history wiping away a conviction for a sexual offense against a child — escaped scrutiny when it happened. It was granted just hours before the American hostages in Iran were freed, which captured headlines for weeks.\" The same article details other allegations of sexual assault of minors made against Yarrow, including the alleged rape of another teenage girl.[51] Yarrow died of bladder cancer on January 7, 2025, at his Upper West Side apartment, at the age of 86.[1] Yarrow received the Allard K. Lowenstein Award in 1982 for his \"remarkable efforts in advancing the causes of human rights, peace, and freedom\".[61] In 1995 the Miami Jewish Federation recognized Yarrow's continual efforts by awarding its Tikkun Olam Award for his part in helping to \"repair the world\".[61][62] Yarrow was awarded the Kate Wolf Memorial Award by the World Folk Music Association in 1993.[63] In 2003 a congressional resolution recognized Yarrow's achievements and those of Operation Respect.[40][64]",

Working as a family ❤️ Such a beautiful moment as Noel reads from his upcoming autobiography (excerpt attached). So much love. love. love. wonderous love. Children's prayers are the strongest... ❤️🙏♥️ Dear Peter, In 2010 I was lucky enough to join you and Noel on stage for a concert in NYC - it was one of the most meaningful experiences of my life, as I grew up listening to P, P & M ’s music and to sing with you both all these years later felt like the most charmed of magical circles coming back around…I am so happy to share this photograph (I don’t know who took it, apologies!) as proof that it happened! I send you comfort and care now, bright eyes, open heart, old and new songs, magic circles and most of all, love love love - Mary Chapin Carpenter Brother Peter - what an inspiration you have been - to millions of Americans of all ages and stripes, and for so many decades. Your quest for justice and peace and equality, and your beautiful and powerful ability to turn music into something so profound. How incredibly lucky I am to have you as a my friend, and how I so loved our regular lunches to discuss .... well, everything. From family to famine, from the senselessness of war to the importance of peace. You have burnished a strong path, and an example for everyone lucky to have touched your spirit, and been consumed by your music. Much love. Always. Forever. Bill Ritter Dear Peter, For three generations you have been a part of our lives. A friend, a neighbor, and a teacher. You told us legends and sang us songs and we feel so lucky to know you. In Puff's cave at Lechusa Point in Malibu all us kids ran around living in our own Hanalei. The soundtrack of our youth. The family, the lessons and the love you have brought us will continue on. We love you. The Grenells - Nani, Sarai, Bodhi, Kiki, Rebecca, Alex, Josh and He Yang You lit up my life with your guitar playing and singing starting in 1963. You lit up my life again at Rancho la Puerta when we became friends. You brotherly embrace, your receiving my healing hands and your patience to listen to my own songs move me still to my core. I love you brother. - Michael Brightwood Peter, your spirit will always live in me as an inspiration for creativity, music, caring, and the joy/hard work of social justice action. I feel graced to have you as my second cousin! Thank you thank you for all you have given to your blood family, your extended family of friends, and for all the love you have spread in our World. ​ - Julie Oak Brother Peter, I love you. You have brought peace, healing, understanding and respect into this world. And you have allowed me to share in that journey. I will be forever grateful to have you in my life. Your voice will live inside my soul and inspire me forever. - Michael Stein I love you Peter and have loved you for fifty years. Travel on, your songs will be sung forever! ​ - Julie Thompson Your love, intensity, humor, creativity, generosity, care, acceptance and advocacy have impacted millions of people on our planet. I sang your songs as a camper in the Catskills in the 1960's - never imagining that someday we would be friends and partners in fighting bullying. Your care about Eric was profound and deeply impactful on a man with challenges. May our spirit always say \"Don't Laugh at Me\" and tonight, I \"Light One Candle\" for you, Peter Yarrow. Love, Elliott Masie Oh Dear Peter - The last time we saw you was in June of this year and your parting words to me were “Please keep in touch, I want to be there for you in this challenging time”. I reached out to share the news that Mike and I are both employed now and when I didn’t hear back from you, I knew something was not as it should be. I learned that you were home from the hospital but very weak. Today, Bethany’s email offering an opportunity to send a living tribute hit me hard as there is no way to sum up the impact you’ve had on my life but I will try to bring some highlights here. Last week, I was showing Noah, now almost 14, a photo of himself at age 2 with Pete Seeger at my alma matter when Pete came to do a talk with song shortly after Toshi passed away. Noah has no recollection of this meeting. I am grateful to say that Noah has many memories of you, dear Peter, and he is at an age where those memories will stay with him. When you invited me to come and work with Operation Respect, I went and spoke with the principal of the school I was teaching in and explained that I needed to leave my position as working with the DLAM program was a once in a lifetime opportunity. She understood and jokingly said “but he has to come sing for the kids first”. I relayed that message and within a couple of days, you were in a taxi on your way up to the Bronx to sing for/with a handful of the classes that I had already started introducing the DLAM curriculum to. This was a classic Peter. Someone, somewhere has a need and you do what you can to help. Over the years, the work of Operation Respect has remained dear to my heart but dearer is the truly remarkable man I got to know. Seeing you over the years has kept some part of my inner need to know things were really going to be okay, alive. The hope was ignited each time. Not only personal hope but hope for our communities, our country and the world. Each time, a reminder that there are people like you, the very best humanity has to offer, who live being lead by their heart and making the connections that need to be made to make change happen! Fast forward to March of 2020 and the world came to “the great pause”. We didn’t know which end was up or where we were going. Your zoom calls, where we all talked and sang together, had more of an impact on my family than you could ever know. My mom joined in from Massachusetts and we joined in from Connecticut as we were not gathering together in person in those early days because we didn’t want to risk doing anything that could risk my octogenarian mother’s life. Those zooms kept our spirits up and gave us hope that despite all else, we would all be okay and carry on as the sweet survivors we are! Just last week, Noah’s music teacher reached out to say that the class is going to transition from orchestra to guitar classes as \"the 8th grade class curriculum delves into the rich heritage of The American Civil Rights Era. This shift in musical focus will allow students to study, play and sing songs that embody the spirit of this pivotal time in our history, fostering both musical growth and cultural understanding.” She went on to say that what they have planned is “historically significant and thought provoking music of Pete Seeger, Wood Guthrie and more”. Noah and I talked about your role in The Civil Rights Movement. Noah grew up with your presence in his life and understands how remarkable you are in the bigger picture, far more than just the man who called himself “Uncle Peter” when Noah was a younger boy. The first thing I thought of when I got the email from Noah’s teacher was - I know that if Peter was well and I asked, he would hop in a car and share with Noah’s class his first hand experiences with what they are studying and sing with them, just like he hopped in that taxi to sing in the Bronx. My mother wrote a “Letter to The Editor” last month, they accepted it and held it until after the election. In the letter, she talked about how we need to come together and heal and not live in the divide. She introduced people to Braver Angels and provided a link to their site. This was another part of our lives that came thru you; my mom is involved with Braver Angels as a result of your sharing about the work you were doing with them and introducing us to them. With that, I want to thank you for being the shining star that you have been in my life and my family’s life! We are grateful for you and all the better for the connection to you! With much love and admiration, Tahri (Gang) I first met Peter at a young and impressionable age. Once a year he would have a youth group of kids on the Circle Line and sing to us. There wasn’t one of us that didn’t know Puff the magic dragon. Peter loved kids. Later in life I had the privilege of working with Noel Stookey and got to know Mary as well. But it was Peter who always made me feel loved and appreciated. Last year we tried to collaborate on a project for the Children of Ukraine but his cancer kept him from working on it. We enjoyed dinner in his neighborhood, his concerts which I loved going to and hour calls and texts. One of his last texts to me in September said: I would’ve loved to have gotten together with you, my brother, but Cancer is like a chronic disease, one that is a race between the technology being developed to impede its progress and the ability of the disease in its own Darwinian struggle. Big hugs, my brother and thank you for checking in XO. Peter. When I called him he said, “This dragon is doing his best to stay strong.” I love you Peter, you taught me so much about love and kindness and you will always be in my heart and life. ​ - John Battiloro Peter doesn't know me, but his music, both with Peter, Paul & Mary and with his solo performances, has been the soundtrack of my life. My parents were both big fans, and we had all of the albums (and, yes, I mean actual albums) playing on our RCA stereo all of the time. My sister and I grew up knowing all of the words of...and singing along with...all of Peter's iconic songs. It was a great thrill to see Peter, Paul & Mary performing live in NYC, along with my dad, not too long before Mary's passing. There are moments you remember all your life...and that performance was one of them for me. And, then, of course, I appreciated so many of Peter's appearances on PBS, both his performances and during the fundraising drives. His music, his passion, his dedication to good causes have been a source of true inspiration and admiration and respect for me. When I read about his work with Operation Respect, I saw how very closely it aligns with the some of the work we are doing at Temple Beth Tikvah (Wayne, NJ) with our Shine a Light program. Thank you, Peter, for all you have meant to me and my family...without ever knowing us. Thank you for modeling your good works for your son and daughter, who, no doubt, will carry on your legacy with honor. I shall continue to keep you in my mishabeirach prayers. Wishing you strength and, most importantly, comfort and peace. Best, Janice Paul Wayne, NJ I had the great joy of meeting Peter at his home in Manhattan for a special event on June 5, 2019, through our mutual friend, John McKenna who worked with Peter on \"Operation Respect\". I attach a picture from that day of Peter with me. But my love of Peter, Paul, and Mary's music dates back to my childhood in South Africa and Australia, and their performance at the Circle Star Theater in San Carlos, CA I attended many years later. I attach with this tribute, an MP3 recording from an old reel-to-reel tape on July 3, 1966 made at our family home in Melbourne, Australia. In this recording, my three sisters, Lindsay, Celia and Wendy and I (Clive) sing one of our favorite songs, \"Puff the Magic Dragon\"... I was ten years old at the time, and fifty-eight years later, I still sing Peter's song. As long as we live, we should all sing \"Puff the Magic Dragon\"! We love you, Peter! - Clive Roberts ​ ​ ​ I first met Peter in the early 1970's when Alex Hassilev, with whom I was living, took me to McCabe's to see Peter do a solo gig. Alex thought we would appreciate each other politically and was he ever right! We went on to produce three Survival Sunday's at the Hollywood Bowel, anti-nuclear programs that featured a wonderful assortment of performers. Then we did a big rally up at Diablo Canyon, again with a star-studded cast of progressive performers. I learned so much about producing live events from Peter and we went on to do films together as well. I remember with great joy a fundraiser we did at 27 West 67th for our film about Allard Lowenstein. Peter went up and started singing and pitching at the same time, and when we got off stage, we had raised $60,000. Peter was also in the Lowenstein film and did a wonderful interview about Al, his dear friend. To cap it off, we used \"Sweet Survivor\" at the end of film and it was wonderfully emblematic of the whole project. So many memories, so many shows back stage, so many fundraisers. When Peter did a concert in Malibu by himself, he stopped midway and said \"Everybody under 12 years of age, Julie and Carl (Rogers) please join me on stage. Carl and I got to sing Puff with the dragon himself. Flash forward to ONE STORY AT A TIME, the film we made with him and Linda Carroll during the pandemic. Having wonderful work at that time because of Peter, was such a gift. I love you Peter and have loved you for fifty years. Travel on, your songs will be sung forever! ​ - Julie Thompson You were kind, generous, and professional when we first met at your guest artist spot at The Flagpole Radio Cafe show in Newtown, CT. Two years later, when our lives and hearts were torn apart and we were so deep underwater in grief and sadness, you were selfless in your love and care for us. You came to our home and cried with us, held us, and sang with us. You kept us in your mind and heart in the years that followed and we are honored and so grateful to have had that time with you and your many healing gifts and those of your family. Your dedication to those who need help and a voice lifted in song is unparalleled and one of the greatest gifts the universe has given us is to have had you by our side when we could not stand. Thank you for everything, Peter, we love you very much. —David and Francine Wheeler Peter, you are my treasured partner in crime in all things Nantucket – whether at Harris Wofford's wedding on the beach where you played so magnificently, or at our home in Sconset where you graced us for several years as our most accomplished and fun and musically gifted chef and house guest. The concerts there which you always welcomed enthusiastically transported so many lucky Nantucket friends who talk about them all the time and wonder when are we doing another with the fabulous Peter Yarrow. Best of all among so many memories is the time you sang for our supper literally – on the docks with the astounded and thrilled fisherman family, which talks about you to this day– you sang the whole of Puff and we were given about 15 huge freshly caught bluefish fillets and you kindly sat for hours in our kitchen and made them into a gigantic bowl of fabulous bluefish salad which we shared widely! I play your music all the time and you are with me so often therefore. Love you love love love love love you, my dearest dragon friend for so many decades. Thank you for the incredible joy you've brought to me and to so many lucky people on this planet. Your music always has the ability to make me float and laugh and smile and it always will. Love you to bits and pieces, dearest friend Peter, Elizabeth Vale Peter you are a deeply dear and beloved friend to me and my family. I’ll never forget the first time I met you. I was around 20 years old, and I was a bit nervous. You had become friends with my parents who spoke adoringly of time spent together, but still I knew you from having grown up with your music, and I knew you as a famous and brilliant musician and activist. I’ll never forget how you immediately disarmed me with an abundant and playful generosity of spirit. You extended to me the most welcoming open-heartedness, and you took my hand and spun me around while singing my name in an intentionally goofy voice. My nerves disappeared and to me, you were family. Over the years, I’ve come to understand that this moment was essentially you. You have an absolutely extraordinary capacity for loving kindness, and you bring this out in other people. Your inner child greets the inner child of another. We often go through the world distancing ourselves from others, and both expecting and creating exclusion. To know you is to experience the gift and the power of inclusion, and to be inspired to share that with others. I’ve been in awe of how your intent and practice are to expand your circle of love. As I think back on the amazing times spent with you, and with Bethany and Valentina, and with my parents and brothers and my niece and nephew… talking, listening, singing, laughing, supporting each other, being together … and the many wonderful concerts, and your touching work to prevent bullying and the countless impactful events you performed at to support good causes and good friends and to stand up for those who need it…. I can see it all framed this way. We have been so incredibly lucky to gather together in a circle of love, in your circle of love. I am so deeply grateful to you. The circle of love is ever expanding. It has become a transformative force of its own. You are forever the source of its profound radiance. Peter- thank you for your presence, your heart, your friendship, your music, your love, and for showing all of us the way to each other. -Jordanna Polis Schutz Peter, you changed the trajectory of my life. The Trio came to San Antonio and performed at the Hemisfair Area in 1969. I attended with my college girlfriend. The next year you came back. I bought tickets and thought she would be my date. There was a death in her family so I invited my brother (Christopher) to come with me on the prepurchased ticket. I learned somewhere that you and Noel and Mary would come out and talk to folks after the show if we waited until the crowd cleared out. About 45 minutes later, the three of you came out and went to different places on the arena floor. I went to you because I was a wantabe guitarist and I loved some of the songs you had written. You talked about your recent trip to India and gradually even the hangers-on began to drift away. I thing there were three or four others besides Chris and myself still there when a security guard appeared and told us that we couldn't be there. You said, \"I'm Peter Yarrow and we performed tonight.\" He said, \"You can go to the dressing room. These people have to leave. At that time, you invited us to meet your for breakfast before you had to fly out. Chris and I went home. I set an alarm, but my mother (knowing that we didn't get in until close to 4 am) turned the alarm off. Two years later, you came back to San Antonio with a group called Lazarus. Rod Kennedy promoted the tour. We reconnected briefly and you said to me, \"You have to be in Kerrville on Memorial Day Weekend. We are starting a festival up there and you would love it.\" I started making plans. I went to the festival for Saturday night. You and Charlie Sumners invited everyone to come to the \"Folk Mass\" on the Schreiner Campus the next morning. I was by myself. I slept in my car and was there. I had just graduated from college. I was running a construction company. I did not have fond feelings for the church-- not hostile, just irrelevant. You and Allen Damron and Charlie brought a whole new perspective to worship, and I returned to the church as a youth director trying to help the kids in the church understand the relevancy. (There were other things happening in my life but a whole lot of it came together at Charlie's service.) I continued to come to the Kerrville Festival. Three years later, my commitments to the church and to my business collided and I had to make some hard choices. I shut my company and went to seminary. In that decade, I missed two festivals. In those days, KFF was only one weekend. To make a long story shorter, I went to seminary in 1975. I was ordained in 1979. That year, Rod Kennedy invited me to join \"the staff\" and I was deeply involved with construction and maintenance on the festival grounds. When the festival was expanded to 11 days in 1981, I was invited to lead worship on the second weekend. I have a picture on my wall of you singing over my shoulder in 1983. For almost a decade, you were a major part of our worship services. Kerrville became a significant part of my life. When Rod and Nancylee Kennedy sold Quiet Valley Ranch and the Folk Festival to a group of patrons, I was one of the original investors. That was in 1997 and 1998. Within five years, the new Executive Director had burned through the half million dollars we (collectively) paid, but had saddled the two corporations with an additional half million dollar debt. Skipping the details, you, Stuart Vexler, Vern Crawford, Lenore Langdorf and myself worked for three months to find a way to save the festival. We talked several times a week. In the end, it all worked out. We formed the Quiet Valley Stewardship Group and raised enough money to escape foreclosure on the land. It was in those days of 2002 that I think we became more than friendly acquaintances and became friends. In 2011, I received a call from my brother Christopher who was a dean at the University of WIsconsin in Madison. He said to me, \"We were sitting in the dean's lounge bemoaning how Scott Walker was working to break the public sector unions in Wisconsin. There are tens of thousands of people wandering the streets, not knowing what to do. One of the other deans said, we need to find a way to bring them together. If we could get Bono here, he could do it.\" Another said, \"U2 is on tour in Africa. That won't work.\" Someone said, \"Peter, Paul and Mary could bring them together but Mary's gone.\" Chris said, \"All of a sudden, every eye in the room was on me. Someone said, \"you've told us that your brother is a friend of Peter Yarrow. Can he get him to come?\" There was silence on the phone and brother Chris broke it saying, \"Well, can you?\" My heart sank. I had a sinking feeling and I didn't want to cash in all the chips that I may or may not have had. I said, \"Send me some information and I'll look at it tonight.\" I was in the choir room at the church when I got my brother's call. I walked back to my office, and thought, there is nothing my brother can send me that will make any difference. My brother has asked me to do something and I either can or I can't. It was about four o'clock on a Monday after noon. I called your cell phone and you answered on the third ring. I said, \"Peter, this is Walter Lee.\" He almost shouted at me, \"What are you doing in Lybia. Don't you know it's dangerous there.\" I said, \"Peter, I'm in Texas.\" You said, \"Oh, goodness that's good. I thought you were Skyping from Lybia. What can I do for you?\" I said, \"Are you aware of what's going on in Madison Wisconsin.? You said, \"Yes, we're following it very closely.\" I related my conversation with my brother and then asked the question, \"Is there any chance that you might be able to go?\" There was dead silence on the phone. I don't know how long it lasted. Then you spoke. \"Walter, I don't think I can leave today.\" You turned to your staff and said, \"When can you get me in and out of Madison this week.\" You came back within a minute and said, \"I can be there Wednesday. I'll stay over night. Tell your brother that I'm staying with him and I'll need to fly out Thursday morning. Or I can fly in and out on Friday.\" I'll never forget calling my brother back within 20 minutes of his call and telling him that he could have you Wednesday evening or mid-day Friday. You went on Friday and sang to a crowd estimated to be 100,000 people in frigid temperatures. Your songs and your message are still up on youtube.com. It's a shame that the people did not prevail. Peter, you have done so much for so many. I will be eternally grateful for our friendship. Thank you, my friend, my brother. You will live ever in my heart. ​ - Walter Lee I’ve known Peter for almost 15 years and admire his spirit and dedication as well as his incredible music. Last April my son my only son, suffered a cardiac arrest and since is in a coma. As you can imagine we were desperately looking for medical help information assistance. Peter was one of the first people who immediately responded by offering his contacts in the medical field. I will never forget his support. My son is still in a coma but one of the tools that is recommended is music therapy and I include in the playlist some of Peter’s songs as well as Bethany’s It's with a heavy/loving heart I look back at my beautiful memories of my precious friend Peter. When I was 13 (1963) attended my first P, P & M concert. Exiting down a back stairwell, Peter appeared, spoke with me, offering a memorable moment. In later years we became friends seeing him a few times a year. He and his kids were my Thanksgiving guests in Vail, CO. Friendship allowed invitations on a few Human Rights Project congressional delegations. One to the middle east leading him to start his own 501c3, \"Operation Respect\" after witnessing the separation of young people due to religious differences. He knew more joined than separated them. God bless Peter! Can't imagine the world without him and all his love for humanity. Love and endless blessings my dearest, precious friend. When you leave for your new dimension I pray to feel your presence every day!! XOXO ​ - Michelle Jourdak Peter provided so much of the sound track of my life--not only in his music and voice, but with his indomitable spirit and values driven commitment. Of course, If I Had a Hammer--I'd hammer out justice!, for the civil rights movement. For Peace in Vietnam with The Great Mandala For health care, for people with disabilities, for immigration reform, for every good cause for freedom and decency--Peter's music was there. And PETER was there. He often came at my request. And he most often came at his generous suggestion. He was there to offer humor, whimsy and joy (Puff the Magic Dragon) and hope (Stewball) He was there to call us to our better angels (Don't Laugh At Me) and he was there to build the movement. His children's books now populate my own grandchildren's shelves. His voice in in my mind, his spirit in my heart. And I hope to carry on his commitments to making this a more just and caring world in all I can do. Love you, Peter -- Heather Booth Peter has been on my musical radar since the early days of Peter, Paul and Mary. My parents had several of their albums, and I listened to them regularly. Their music is still in my rotation, in fact. My fondest memory, however, is a fundraiser he attended for Senator Tammy Baldwin in 2012. Thanks to weather issues (at least I was thankful for them) he was not able to travel to his next destination after his first scheduled fundraiser. He then agreed to add a second fundraiser for Tammy in Green Bay, WI. I was fortunate to attend, and I, along with everyone else in attendance, were awed and inspired my his music, his performance, and his emotional exhortations to get out and work Tammy and President Obama. Exactly one week later, his inspiration (and the work he inspired) led to both of them emerging victorious. Despite the sorrow of the most recent presidential election, Senator Baldwin was re-elected. To me, this year's success still owes a debt to Peter from 12 years ago. Thank you, and God bless, Peter! ​ - Jim Morgenstern Dear Peter, precious friend and brother, There are so many ways in which you have touched Trina and me and our children and grandchildren through your music, art, storytelling, and heartful sharing. You have done the same for millions of people across the world. We have seen you leverage the opportunity and responsibility that your talent, celebrity, and social capital give you to be a positive force and role model for people and groups. We have seen you give people hope, enabling them to embrace their common humanity and their connectedness to and with people whom they have never met. We have seen you uplift and unite many disparate people and groups-- even when people have been in places of grief, frustration, and despair. And we have seen you touch the hearts of leaders so that they could connect to their values and be more motivated them to do good. Peter, you had a profound and humanizing impact on others, both directly and through others, including Trina and me. Let us share one such occasion. The setting was Dakar, Bangladesh in 2012, during a general strike. The context was work that Trina and I were doing with a wonderful NGO, BRAC. The specific occasion was a weeklong co--constructive collaboration between two Jewish Americans and 20 Islamic Bangladeshi BRAC staff. Our goal was incorporate culturally responsive social emotional learning into the 64,000 primary schools that BRAC ran for first-generation students in rural Bangladesh. The last session included a summative closing. The closing started with participants sharing what they had learned, how they felt about what they had learned it, and what they would do with what they learned. We concluded the intentionally evocative closing by listening to Palestinian and Israeli singers, Amal Murkus and David Bozer join you in singing “Don’t Bully Me” and “We Shall Overcome,” recordings that came out of your peace building work in Palestine and Israel, that you had often shared with us and others. We shared that historical context with our Bangladeshi colleagues as it was resonant with group conflict in Bangladesh. They spontaneously joined in the final song, singing We Shall Overcome in Bangla while you, Trina and I were singing in English, and Amal and David sang in Arabic and Hebrew. That 2012 memory has remained a vivid memory of an experience that reflected your biculturalism, multiculturalism, internationalism, and peacebuilding. Although we did not tape that memorable moment, we found a version of “We Shall Overcome” being sung in English, Bangla, Hindi, and Urdu, which was recorded to uplift people during Covid. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9EOKKyKy54 We share with you in recognition of your bountiful love and great work. Peace and love, David and Trina Osher My dearest friend and “Uncle” of 43 years. Where to begin? I write this to you through tears because of the love that I have for you and our friendship. You have been such an important part of my life, and for that I will always be grateful. I so admire the warm, generous, compassionate, genuine person that you are. Your humor is one of a kind, we have shared so many laughs throughout the years, we really do “get” each other. My life will forever be better because you’ve been a part of it. I wish we could have more time together, but I wanted you to know that I will always cherish the times we’ve had and the time we still have. Thank you for being you and for being a blessing in everyone’s life, especially mine and my family. I have loved our back and forth texts that are more like novels with our silly pics/emojis that you and I appreciate even if we don’t always know what they are or what they mean, lol. You’ve done so many incredible things in your life—for your family, in your career, and for all of us who care about you. What a difference you’ve made. A person like you doesn’t come along very often. You made so many tough times easier and the best times even better. I will hold every memory we’ve made together close to my heart forever. Thank you for everything. I love you with all my heart. ~Lisa I have so many fond memories with Peter. It is hard to put them all in writing, but I will tell you a few which have always stuck with me. When I was in the 4th grade, Peter was preforming a singalong with a school. While he was singing with the students of the school I got up to go see Mary. Peter, in the middle of his song, says where is my sweetheart Sarah going. No matter if it was that moment or the many concerts/events I spent time with him, he would always look out for me and make sure I was around. Sometimes Peter would even enlist me to help with sound checks. Peter has such a kind heart and was a very close friend to my mom and me. My mom was sick for many years and he would always check in and call her to see how she was. He truly cares for others and shows his love for everyone. Peter is an amazing, caring, loving and most of all an inspiring friend. I have been fortunate to have such an amazing friend in my life and I know many others feel the same. ​ - Sarah Burch My brother Peter: My heart is full with numerous warm memories of our times together and your plentiful kindnesses to me. Three stand out. First--years ago you came to my synagogue in D.C. to do a concert. We did a sound check together. We were having so much fun, it turned into a ten-song soundcheck. Which then turned into the entire second set of the concert. At the end of the first set, you told the crowd I'd be joining you for the second set. You said \"I enjoy singing with Doug so much, I'm thinking of leaving the group.\" You paused, then said \"Just kidding.\" After we sang \"Such Is Love\" to open the second set, I said: \"Peter, I'm glad you told the audience that your line about leaving the group was just a joke. For a moment, I had an image that I would go down in folk music history: \"Doug Mishkin, the Yoko Ono of Peter Paul & Mary.\" 2. From the first time I heard \"Sweet Survivor,\" I knew I'd be singing it for the rest of my life. And I have. Your joining me to record it on an album of mine in 2008 is a never-ending thrill of mine. 3. At the URJ Biennial in 1997, you ended the evening's concert by singing \"Day Is Done.\" I was on your left. Bethany and Debbie Friedman were on your right. You gave me the second verse, Debbie the third. Behind us were Saperstein and Vorspan. It was a moment of sheer joy. I couldn't have been more proud. Recently one of my daughters found the video on YouTube and asked if I'd ever seen it. I told her: \"Only a few hundred times.\" I look at the young people in the audience and am moved to tears by their sheer joy in singing along. You did that for them, and have done it for me my entire life. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1icsAdG1t44. Sending all my love, knowing all will indeed be well when the day is done. Doug Mishkin While the world knows you as a legendary musician, for the past 30 years we've been blessed to know you as a devoted friend, tireless activist, and constant inspiration. Your loyalty and dedication to both personal friendships and the larger fight for humanity have shown us what it means to live one's values fully. Some battles may have seemed like tilting at windmills, but you've shown us time and again that persistent dedication to justice yields real change. Your work with Operation Respect has transformed countless young lives. Your unwavering commitment to civil rights protests helped bend the arc of history toward justice. And through Better Angels, you've helped bridge divides that many thought impossible to cross. You've taught us that being on the side of the angels isn't just about fighting the good fight - it's about achieving tangible progress through unwavering dedication and moral courage. Your friendship has enriched our lives immeasurably, not because of your fame or your music, but because of your fundamental decency, your fierce loyalty, and your proven ability to make the world better. With deep love and gratitude, Irene and Lee I had the honor of seeing PP& M each Easter, when they would come to the SF Bay Area. As a budding guitarist, I studied the guitar parts and the stunning harmonies. Recently my partner Judi and I spent a week at a resort in Mexico with Peter, as he was healing. He attended our concert and proclaimed us ”Folksingers!” And invited us to perform with him at his concert. We sang “Stewball” and “Blowin’ In the WInd” and he set us up like PP&M. It was truly an out of body experience for me. I couldn’t believe it was me singing those songs. We had lunch with him in New York last year and visited him at his home. He told story afternoon story , filling in the history of the music of my life. I will never forget being at a demonstration protesting Diablo Canyon’s nuclear power plant and hearin his voice as he led us all in “Blowin’ In the Wind’. It showed me the power of music to lift the spirit and nurture hope. Thank you, Peter! ​ - Bob Reid Peter - It’s jaimee king, Linda Carroll Barraud’s daughter. I just want to thank you for all you’ve been to our family - to this world. I don’t know if you recall the story, but long before we met you personally, I took my little boy to your concert at a park in San Francisco. You had all the kids come to the stage, and just as you started to play, the most horrible screeching of static occurred. To my horror, I loved and saw my 2year old holding both ends to the amp cord that he’d yanked out with delight making that awful noise. I was mortified and ran up to grab him, and you just smiled, plugged the amp back in, and went back to it. In inconsequential event, but a core memory. And now, we have more. You playing music with your lovely children at the ranch and at mom’s house - you playing for mom at her birthday party this year by zoom. You show up so completely. You’re a gift to our world, a gift to my family - thank you for everything. Much love, Jaimee King We have all been so very blessed to have Peter in all of our lives for so many years. We have unforgettable happy memories of love, music, laughter, joy, shared meals, and deeply meaningful shared passions and hopefulness, even during challenging times. We saw the deep fatherly love and pride he felt for Bethany & Christopher during visits and performances at Rancho La Puerta. His deep love and compassion extended to all of us who were so honored to be included in his circle of friends, that became an integral part of his extended family. Peter & Puff have a shared magical dragon spirit that can never be extinguished, and will always have a warmly embraced presence in our hearts, that we will cherish and pass on to future generations. Godspeed our beloved dragons, Peter & Puff, our love will always be with you, accompanying you on your heavenly journeys. ​ - Joseph, Nancy, Danielle, Jeremy, Lizzy, Courie, Indy, Ridley, & Ayla Weiss I saw the photo of you singing to my brother in his hospital bed with a circle of family and friends around you. I was devastated that I had not been there been there. And Lo And Behold a year after my brother’s death, I was singing Puff the Magic Dragon with you, at Alex’s gravesite in 2003 for my brother’s yartzeit. This memory added to so many others shines with your love and generosity. Your remarkable way of engaging moments of sorrow and turning them towards strength, towards unity, celebration and tenderness, in the spirit of we shall overcome. You walk into the grieving Spaces after a school shooting and create healing magic You dare to bring that twinkle in your eyes and face down monstrosities. Of all the times that I have sung your songs through the years and all the ways your songs have carried me since I learned to play the guitar when I was 12 years old, my favorite memory is singing all the songs in Peter, Paul, and Mommy over and over again with Emily when she was four or five years old and we were driving back-and-forth to the ranch from our cabin in the mountains. The time would fly by. In these last days and hours I pray that your soul travels well, knowing that you will be remembered with great love and that your songs will continue to flow through us in sorrow and in joy. Dearest Peter, thank you for being in my life. ​ - Sarah Brightwood Peter I am tiny, maybe 4, twirling around singing along with you, Paul and Mary. I love you. ​ I learn so much through the songs that you sing. You hold my tiny hand, and shape my voice, values and heart— even as we had not yet met. ​ My high school and college years at University of Oregon: I sing your songs to myself through moments of my life. Scary, hard, beautiful, resolved. Your voice and mine are merged. ​ I sing your songs to my babies. They learn about beauty and pain and their job as healthy citizens of this planet and stewards of the earth. Your voice still finds me, I am a young adult. Your words still teach me and help me become more courageous and stay kind. ​ I am sitting with you at the ranch. We sing together. My heart is home and filled with joy. We are in the same room. We are at the same table. We share food and words. You have become a dear, dear family friend. You are every bit as magical as my tiny self imagined— and more— and I love you— more. ​ I am at Sundance film festival with you. You bring me places with you. I talk about bullying prevention. You teach me even more. You feed me. You teach me new things. We see other artists and You show impeccable respect. You take me to my first Jewish experience. You are generous and kind and consistently humane. You are also very funny and fun. ​ You show up. You sing. You get the room laughing. After such an event at our la jolla home, people write me thank you’s for weeks. It is all you. You bring people to the center of our hearts, remind us of our souls, and flood the spaces that you are in with love. People write me, “it was a spiritual experience to be with you and Peter and everyone in that room.” People remember that they are each sacred around you— that we are each sacred. ​ You are my hero, my heartbeat and my beloved friend. I hold hands with you at the edge of a field of wildflowers, and I breathe us both. You are held as you have held. Your footsteps continue. I hear you around corners, in guitars, in record players, streaming, and in bubbling creeks in the mountain towns. ​ I love you forever and I am more me because I have had the privilege of being here with you. ​ I hear you in the children in the yard next door, they sing, “five, ten, fifteen, twenty…” ​ I love you, Peter Yarrow, my Uncle Peter. I am hugging and kissing you right now, feeling your goodness lift this world. We are better beings because you've been one of us. You have done so very well. So very, very well by all of us. A champion of humanity indeed. ​ Forever yours, Nicole Jon Sievers Wow, Peter Yarrow, the happy dragon of Peter, Paul, and Mary was knocking on our door, waiting to carpool the neighborhood kids to Malibu Montessori school. We’d never met before, but; we felt connected. While Peter was organizing, leading and singing in anti-Vietnam War protests, we were marching in those protests. Over the next 50 years, our relationship grew in love and respect as we worked together against the nuclear power plant in Morro Bay, problems in the Philippines, and most recently against Gun Violence in Schools. After Peter organized singer-songwriters to travel to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School to help surviving students manage their grief, he asked us to document some students with their results. And there’s also Peter's zany sense of humor. We’ll always remember Peter, dressed as the Easter Bunny, romping down the beach, delivering eggs to kids on Easter morning! Peter is family. Peter is LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Beth & George Gage As I surveyed the devastation of November 5th this year, I wondered whether I could retreat from the battlefield of social justice and turn my attention exclusively to private pleasures: family, music, photography, travel. I realized I couldn't and then started to survey the origin of my passion for achieving a just society. It certainly didn't come from my parents who, my G-d, voted for Richard Nixon in 1960. I then realized that it came from the soft and insistent music and lyrics of the folk music which I imbibed throughout the 1960's and, of course, Peter, Paul & Mary was the first among the folk artists to whom I listened: \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\" and \"Blowin' in the Wind?\". These songs and others by P, P &M (as well, of course, the recordings, of Joan, Judy and Phil) imbedded themselves into my very being and made me the person who I am today and have been my entire life. Without your music, Peter, I may well have become that big law attorney that my father wished me to be. I want to thank you, Peter, for that and for the personal relationship we developed while I was at Warner Bros Records and afterwards. It was the thrill of a lifetime to become friends with one of the icons of my adolescence. Not just friends, but also colleagues, as you engaged me in your activities on behalf of, anti-bullying and gun control and safety. Also, thank you for your beautiful tribute to me on the occasion of my receiving The Spirit of Liberty award from People for the American Way. Thank you, Peter, for turning my life toward the work of peace and justice. You are in substantial part responsible for the life I have led and the person I became. Peace, Brother.... David Altschul You can't say Peter Yarrow without also saying Charlotte Frank because both of them worked so well together to found the organization which has brought Israel and the people of the United States closer together. Peter first met Charlotte when he came to her office at the Board of Education where she was in charge of curiculum and asked her if he could sponsor a contest where the students could win prizes for their essays. Shortly after that when Peter learned that Charlotte was bringing students to Israel and was also bringing Principals from various schools throughout the Country he said he'd like to join her and bring his music to Israel. All of his songs were translated into Arabic and Hebrew and most of the classes had students of both denominations. I came to know Peter after Charlotte and I were married and joined with them on a couple of trips and was amazed to hearth children in singing Hebrew and Arabic. As to my own relationship with Peter it was well known that he and I were very far apart politically but we were able to overcome our differences by simply agreeing to disagree as his view of the world and mine were totally different. Not withstanding that we used to go to the Board Meetings at his apartment and he asked me to join the Board which I did. At each meeting he would go around the room and each of the people in attendance would say who they were and what they were doing and what they would like the organization to accomplish. Eventually they put together a curiculm to be taught to school children and it was very successful. Peter is a very talented and loves his music and he enjoys being with people especially at his apartment. Peter is a larger than life figure and I doubt that I will ever again meet somebody who has his talent and his ability to do well by doing good. With Respect, -Marvin Leffler NYC Peter is prophet, mentor, friend, peace maker, justice seeker, wisdom provider, troubadour for kindness, tireless in the pursuit of a merciful and grace filled world and the person who best composed and sang the soundtrack of my life. A more loving and compassionate man I never met - VIVA Peter! Presente! ​ - Joe Eldrige Dear Peter, You are hands down the most loving, most compassionate, and most gracious person I have ever met. Since I was a little girl you have been a guiding star in my life. You saw me when I was doing my best to be invisible. You loved me despite my quirks. Your dedication to love and justice have been who I have modeled myself after and your friendship has been a treasure. I love you. Peter, What can I say? You (along with Mary and Noel) were the very first inspiration for my life of commitment to peace. I heard If I Had a Hammer while driving a truck on the TO a cattle ranch in Raton, MN before my freshman year in college, and it transformed me into an activist. Decades later, John Garamendi introduced us, and we a have been partners ever since. Knowing you, traveling with you, and working with you has been a tremendous privilege and a personal joy. Operation Respect, your creation, has been among the most valuable new initiatives to build peace and promote cooperation in our lifetime, and the impact will be realized in the lives of tens of thousands of young people as they mature and throughout their lives. Your legacy will be revered and it will endure for generations. Few people in any walk of life has made a greater impact for good. We love you, and we are with you every step of the way. Be sure Bethany, Christopher, and Mary Beth know we are ready to help in any way we can. We will come to NYC to visit if you are up to it, but we don't want to intrude. Take good care of yourself, and know you are loved and honored for all that you have done and for the amazing human you are. You and your spirit live on and on in all of us. XOXOXO, Chic Peter Yarrow raised me from a child (although he would not have been aware of that until I was nearly 60, when I met him in person for the first time.) Like Peter, Paul and Mary, I was “formed” in 1961. Luckily for me, my brother Dale Jones was 13 at that time, and it was he who introduced me to so many of the most important things in my life, including the magical music of PPM. I cannot recall a time in my life when the music of PPM was not playing somewhere in our home or our car - if not ringing out on our record player (and later on other formats!) then through my brother’s guitar and voice. Many of my earliest lessons in justice and humanity came as my brother explained PPM’s powerful lyrics to me starting in the 60s. When our daughters were born in the 1990s, I paid this forward by playing Peter, Paul and Mommy and then Peter, Paul and Mommy Too. I finally got to meet Peter in 2019 at Harvard Business School, of all places. I found myself sitting at a conference with mostly other “business people”, who shared a desire to leave the world a better place than we found it. Many participants had invited guests who shared that goal. To my overwhelming surprise, I saw Peter Yarrow (THE Peter Yarrow!!) sitting several rows in front of me. As a New Yorker, I at first played it cool and resisted the urge I felt to run up and fanboy him, but when he rose to walk at a break, I shamelessly threw myself at him, explaining to him how he had raised me. Peter, being Peter, hugged me and could not have been more engaging. Picking up on the theme of the conference, I asked what he was working on, and - as always - he was engaged in many wonderful causes, but he raised with me the work he was doing with “the Parkland Kids”, the survivors of the Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School tragedy. Less than a week later, he had enlisted me to help in my small way. In the ensuing years, Peter has made my family and me feel part of his family, even completing the circle during COVID by singing to my brother over Zoom on his birthday and giving him a guitar with a loving inscription and marvelously whimsical self portrait! Dragons live forever, and this dragon, Peter, will live forever through the love that he showered on so many people. We love you, Peter! ​ - Alan (AJ) Jones Peter, You have touched and influenced my life since I was 11 years old. I could play guitar back then (1964) and I tried to emulate all of your wonderful finger-picking guitar passages. In that same year I had my first paying gig, playing; Blowing in the Wind, If I had a Hammer, etc. I was paid five bucks which felt like a fortune. Fast forward to a year ago when you called me to invite me to accompany you & Noel on mandolin and guitar. During that initial call, I relayed the above story to you and without missing a beat, you said:\"So where's my commission?\"....your sharp-witted, gentle, humor had me in an instant. I already knew that I loved your musicality, and you were one of the guiding beacons of social justice that has helped to illuminate a path for me...and for all of us, really, so I knew that working with you was going to be really special, but I didn't yet know how truly special it would be. You welcomed me in like a long lost brother. I treasure the times we sat in your apartment, playing guitars, eating Chinese food, discussing the world. You were a \"hero' when I was 10, and now at age 71, you remain a hero to, but more importantly, a friend that I love. Weave me the Sunshine, dear Brother Peter, you're forever in my heart. -Gordon Dear Peter, you are a dear friend to so many people and I am honored to be one. After loving Peter, Paul and Mary for decades, I had the honor of volunteering at the National Association of Elementary School Principals convention in San Francisco when Peter, Paul and Mary introduced the anti-bullying program, Operation Respect, based on the Steve Seskin and Allen Shamblin song \"Don't Laugh At Me\" . Shortly after, you presented it to the California State PTA (Parent Teacher Association) Convention. As the San Francisco PTA president, I turned to the friend next to me and said I want to get Peter to our Founder's Day dinner and forgetting that magic happens, I added, \"yeah, right!\" Of course it did happen and you presented the program to the San Francisco Unified School District back to school rally for all of the teachers. Peter, you fill my heart with joy and love. You are the best hugger! I love you for all that you are including your strong commitment to social justice. One of your projects that moves me deeply, because it helps immigrant families in multiple ways, is One Story At a Time. My talks and meals with you are important moments in my life. My son Coleman, has known and loved you since he was in 5th grade and I love how you connected with Coleman from the start. A bonus of being your friend has been getting to know some of your family, friends, and fans, including Bethany, Valentina, and Tony Arancio. I love Brenda Goldman and her family. The most recent time we saw one another was in March, 2024 in Monterey, California where you and Noel performed. After the concert you greeted us at the front of the stage and you said to me, Sherrie, come here. You have to meet these amazing musicians who live near you, Judi Jaeger and Bob Reid. You are going to love them. Of course, you are right. I've been to two of their concerts virtually already and hope to see them in person soon. I love you deeply, Peter, and am eternally grateful that you are in the world making it a better place and in my life bringing me joy and so much more. ​ - Sherrie Rosenberg So many stories to share!!! We grew up on Peter, Paul and Mary. From the day their first album was out their music filled our home. My late mother taught elementary school music and although she studied opera and concert piano she loved folk music. Peter has said she was a product of her times…a “closet Commie”…remember??? as she taught us the entire Pete Seeger canon as well. But Peter, Paul and Mary was her go to and ours….we learned and still them all…every last one and since I also know his latest. As I grew older their songs took on more and more meaning for me and by the time I was a teenager and involved in Anti-War activities their songs and singing were my prayers and still are. I seriously wore out the grooves in my LPs. I got married and moved to Israel. In June of 1983 they gave a concert in the Sultan’s Pools under the wall of the Old City. We were there…with a big crowd and a bottle of wine. It was magic. And then, as I recalled, it, Peter took a piece of paper and taped it to the mike. He explained that he had written a new verse and wanted to make sure he got it right. He then said…I have denied my heritage for many years….under the walls of the Old City, in the Holy City of Jerusalem I declare that I am back. And then they sang “Light One Candle” which has become our Chanukah theme song and we have been blessed by Peter singing it for/with us, in “modern times” at our home on Chanukah as well. Bottom line….so I remembered the story. I might also add that my wife’s, Debbie, late father was a well-known Israeli government official of the time. He met them before the concert and brought us home a signed LP… We continued our love for their music. Taught our children every song. Never met them. always from a distance. Then, Peter…this is where the real story starts…..David Broza….Peter’s dear friend and fellow musician…called me and asked if I’d like to meet Peter…knowing my obsession with the music. After I hyperventilated I said…hell yes and a new chapter in our lives was written. When we met, I asked Peter..if I remembered the story correctly….he teared up and gave me the whole amazing back story and we have been together ever since and Peter will be forever!!! That day began the most amazing Friday Night Shabbat Dinners at our place with your holy singing….great stories for another post…I could write a book…..meetings in diners….Italian restaurants….your apartment on the UWS. You brought me into powerful projects like Better Angels….fighting Anti-Semitism…..political activism – where you would begin, on zoom, with a song of course, I’d speak about the power of voting and getting the vote out and of course you’d end with a song….If I had a Hammer and Blowing In The Wind always….Debbie used to listen and said it was like watching a movie about the 6o’s it was so powerful. And so much more!!!! not to mention my Birthday Parties!!!! LOL……blew everyone’s mind that Peter Yarrow sang and ended by leading the crowd already singing with you in Happy Birthday. Peter, you bless us….make our life’s better…..increase our conscience……changed us……you are the Holy Dragon and “Dragons live forever”!!!!! We love you!!!!! Dear Pessach….we love you!!!!!! ​ - David Sable To my dear friend, Peter. I know people around the world will be sharing stories about how much your iconic songs have meant to them. Having grown up in the 60s, your powerful lyrics and anthems have meant so much to me too. As I have grown older, however, it’s been your unyielding activism and fight for civil rights that have meant even more. Few people have dedicated their lives -- their ever-waking hours -- to continue to fight for peace and social reform. But having the rare opportunity to have gotten to know you through The Carter Center has meant even more. I treasure our conversations that were filled with love and laughter. I will forever value our shared work to promote respect and tolerance in schools. I think of you every day as I admire the painting you did for me. It proudly has a place in my home. So, among the countless contributions to your legacy, your music is uniquely positioned at the center of American culture and your life’s work in social justice will continue to inspire generations. But it’s your friendship and generosity, Peter, that have touched me the most. Peace and love, Gail Shore My friendship with my very dear friend Peter has been an important part of my life for the past 20 years. He represents so much that is good and needed in the world, and I admire him as much as anyone I have ever known. Intelligence. Humor. Veracity, Integrity. Action. Bravery. These all describe Peter. But the word I most associate with him is passion. Make that Passion, with a capital P. Not long after we met, Peter asked me to be on his Operation Respect Board. \"But do not join unless you have passion for it,\" he said. \"I want people with a passion for what we do.\" I was honored to be asked, and happy to accept. However, on the day I was to first go to Peter's house to meet the rest of the board, my marriage exploded. In shock and dismay, I called Peter and told him I was unable to go. Not only did he offer words of solace and wisdom, but continued to do so in the months ahead, helping me through a very difficult time. And that is Peter. Known for his musical and humanitarian work on a global scale, he is also able to relate on an intimate, personal one, showing that he hears you and he cares. He is truly one of a kind. There are many individuals who speak of the concerns of the world; Peter acts upon them. He has been tireless in his work with the downtrodden, the underserved, the oppressed. And it is always with a song, a song that he shares with us all, and in doing so, he gives us hope. He is also my phone buddy, with whom I can discuss politics and other shared interests for long periods of time. I love Peter. I hope he knows it, because I truly do. ​ - Dolores Eyler While Peter and I had a long overlapping history (for example, we were both at the Washington DC Vietnam War protest in 1971), we did not actually meet until 2010 when he was invited to Ukraine by Peace Corps Volunteers when I was their country director. At his first concert for the Volunteers, I ended up on stage joining him on “If I Had a Hammer.” I uploaded a photo of that memorable occasion! Peter inspired the Volunteers with his Operation Respect messages and came back many times over the next few years. Peter and I reconnected in 2019 when he did a benefit concert with Noel Paul Stookey at the Lebanon (NH) Opera House. He greeted me with a warm hug and told me about Braver Angels (then called Better Angels), the national citizens movement that brings Americans together to bridge the partisan divide. Embracing values of respect, humility, honesty, and responsible citizenship, the goal is not to change people’s views of issues, but to change their views of each other. I have been involved ever since! Thank you, Peter! ​ - Douglas Teschner Dearest Peter, You are a special person for so many reasons. You are an important part of our lives and always will be so. When Burt was ill, you came to our home and performed your magic for him to relieve him from his pain and suffering. You and Puff the Magic Dragon lifted all our spirits. You generously have given to the entire world a heart filled with love and the joy of living. Your legendary music inspired us whenever we heard you, Paul and Mary sing, in Brooklyn and at Tanglewood. You made us feel special when Burt and I walked down the aisle at Carnegie Hall when you would yell out and, of course, at the top of your voice, “Here Come the Fendelman’s”. Your social activism was and is still an inspiration to me and to so many others! Know that you are beloved by so many! Sending you love and peace! Helaine I am 66 years old, and have been a Peter, Paul & Mary fan since I was about five (c. 1963). My mother passed on two of the early albums, and I played them continually, learning all the lyrics and melodies by heart. Because of Peter (and Paul and Mary) I became a firm folk devotee, later picking out many of the songs on guitar. Their stunning rendition of \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\" eventually led me to John Denver. In the summer of 1991 I had the pleasure of meeting Peter at an event at Great Adventure Theme Park in New Jersey, where I had come with my partner, David Gordon, and a Peace Child contingent. PP&M were performing, and we were also accompanied by Trudy Mason of NYC, then Peter's girlfriend. I met Peter after the show, and he gave me a great big hug. It was an honour and pleasure to meet one of my childhood idylls. Love, peace, and godspeed to you, Peter. xxx - Caroline Smith My Dear Brother Peter, I am so sorry to hear that your battle with cancer has not been going well. The note I received from Christopher and Bethany has led me to do a lot of reflecting on our great friendship of the last almost 10 years. When we first met at a Carter Center event in California I was excited to tell you that Peter Paul and Mary's first record album was the first one I bought with my own money as a high school student in back in1963 and that I remember listening to it whenever I possibly could. Our friendship developed from there and it would take a few typewritten pages to describe all of the wonderful interactions I have had with you since then. Even though we have lived far apart I have been so very grateful that we have been able to stay in close touch through subsequent Carter Center events, your concert dates in Minnesota (during one of which you introduced me to Noel Paul Stookey!), regular texts and occasional phone calls. You have had a tremendous positive influence on my son Curt and his family and I can't thank you enough for that-Curt will never forget the glowing critique you provided after I shared a video of his version of \"Don't Laugh at Me\". I am aware of many of your humanitarian efforts over the years but am certain that I am not aware of many others. It is mind boggling to me when I try to contemplate all of the lives you have had such a positive effect on throughout your life. I can truthfully say that there is no other human being that I admire more than you and I am eternally grateful that you have honored me with your friendship. I love you Peter Yarrow! Your Forever Brother Bob XXXXXXOOOOOO Dear Peter, Although you knew my husband and father in-law, Len Rosenfeld, forever, we first met at my home, where we sang, played piano and guitar, and ate key lime pie! We became good friends and spent time together each time you visited South Florida. You're always in my heart and I shall treasure our visits and the video of our first visit, my 70th birthday, forever. Yes, you were my 70th birthday present. Your 86 years have been a present to our world. Peace and much love, Penni Mark Rosenfeld, my husband, sends much love with tears. We'll miss you, buddy. ​ - Penny Fromm Peter- I have been fortunate to know you for over 20 years now, ever since we met through the Guggenheim's \"Learning to Read Through the Arts\" program. From the moment we crossed paths, your warmth, openness, and kindness drew me to you, and we immediately became friends. You are, without question, a one-of-a-kind man. There's a quote that comes to mind when I think of you: “A person who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.” Your life has been anything but wasted, Peter. You’ve spent it pouring your energy into causes that matter, into people who need your kindness, and into creating beautiful moments of music and joy for all who are lucky enough to be around you. Your humanitarian work, especially the creation of the Operation Respect platform, which helped Israel-Arab children connect with one another, is a testament to your belief in unity, understanding, and the power of empathy. The way you've dedicated yourself to breaking down barriers and building bridges between cultures is something that will leave an indelible mark on the world. You have made a difference—truly—a difference that echoes far beyond what most of us will ever know. The memory of the many musical gatherings at your home, with friends and loved ones, will forever remain in my heart. You were always the most gracious, caring host, and those evenings were filled with music, laughter, and a sense of community that only you could foster. And who could forget those countless Rosh Hashanah holidays, spent with you, Valentina, Bethany, and so many others, when you would get up and sing \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" with such joy and spirit. Those moments, Peter, will always be with me and my family. You will forever be remembered as “Peter,” the voice of Peter, Paul, and Mary, but to me, you are so much more. You are a true friend, a man whose kindness and generosity knew no bounds. I never had the honor of meeting Christopher in person, but I felt as though I knew him through your stories—your love for him was always so palpable, and I’m sure he is just as proud of you as we all are. As you’ve touched the lives of so many, I want you to know that your legacy will live on in the countless people whose lives you’ve changed, the children you helped, the music you shared, and the friendships you forged. Thank you, Peter, for being the light that you are, for showing us all what it means to live with purpose, compassion, and authenticity. Xoxo, Vivian Serota Perhaps 45 years ago, my wife, Cynthia, was an officer of the PTA at PS 158 in Manhattan (located on York Avenue between 77th and 78th Streets. She became aware of the benefit concert that Peter gave at PS6, where we learned, his mother had taught and decided to cold call Peter to see if he would be willing to do a similar concert for our kids' school. Her friends told her that there was no chance as Peter had no connection to her or the school. Surprise!!. With no hesitation, Peter agreed to do it, explaining how important public education was to him, then invited Cynthia to his apartment to discuss it (a huge thrill for her) and even gave her ideas as to how to maximize the fundraising. The concert was not only a huge fundraising success and a great fun event for the children and their parents, but it was a hugh morale booster for the school. Years later, I was (and still am) on the board of a non-profit called the National School Climate Center which has goals similar to Operation Respect. There were some discussions about our two organization getting together and in those discussions, I saw , in a different way, how comitted Peter is to a fairer, more humane world. In the course of those discussions, there was the added treat of hearing Peter share some of his fascinating anecdotes of his times on the world stage. Clearly, Peter has had a life \"well lived\" Jerry Rothstein My Pietro--your generosity that shows up in the endless outpouring of your music is something I have experienced in everything from meals to carpets or paintings or introductions to such as Seiji Ozawa or some obscure wrist watch you decided I simply must have. And what taste you always showed in the gifting! I have said thanks to you more often (almost) than to Mother Tao and routinely we both enjoyed whatever it might be. But our main gifts to each other may have been those combination walks in Central Park with talks about whatever....just for the pleasure of exercising our minds. We'd even find ourselves learning something sometimes. The true pleasure though was in expressing mutual love for each other. I am most pleased to have pointed out and shared unusual bird songs, trees, and all manner of natural fascinations with you over the years. But you yourself are the greatest natural fascination to me. YOU the being...expressing and sharing in this world which sometimes seems to be trying to teach humans to be mean, selfish and cold-hearted. You have been, nose in the wind, always insisting on beauty and thoughtfulness. You, our Ambassador of the songs and singers, puppets and dancers of EMBRACING THE ROOT, will always be with us wherever the wisdom of the trees, lakes and stars will lead. So as always, my beloved Pietro, keep a'rockin' and keep our love in mind wherever that may take you. ​ - Carman Moore I've been going to the Kerrville Folk Festival with my parents since I was a baby and have always enjoyed getting to hear Peter play--and sometimes getting to go up on stage with all of the other kids to sing \"Puff, the Magic Dragon.\" At the 2014 festival, I got to see Peter play a set accompanied by Christopher. For their performance of \"The Fox,\" Peter asked for a child to come up on stage--\"We need someone to come help us out with this one. Someone under 6?\"--but no kids volunteered. Then he adjusted the call: \"Ok, under 30!\" I was 27 at the time and happily went up to join them. It was an absolute delight getting to share the stage with Peter and Christopher for that song. I was especially touched when I ran into Peter again at the following year's festival and he remembered me! Thank you so much for your music, your laughter, and your gentleness. I now have a daughter of my own, born in 2022, who has been out to Kerrville twice so far. She has her own copy of the \"Puff, the Magic Dragon\" children's book and is learning that dragons, like love and music, live forever. ​ - Clara Boling Storms Peter Our love Our Dragon Your sweetness and endless loving being I love you forever Your name and spirit lives on making us remember what it means to be human. Thank you for all you give To Carman To Embracing the Root To me We created a new theatre form Together with you. We love you Forever. Lotte Arnsbjerg My dearest Peter, one of the joys of my life has been meeting you as a result of having worked for Susan Polis Schutz for 20 years. All our time together was special, seeing that beautiful face of yours and talking with you so many times and sharing music and poetry -- it's meant the world to me. I always admired the way you believed in the goodness of people and their hope to get along together. I admired the way you brought music into the lives of young people from Israel and Pakistan, connecting them with the power of music. I admired your trips around the world and your wonderful music. I adore you, I love you, you are one of the most extraordinary human beings I've ever known. ​ - Kareñ Bidgood Dearest Peter, As Linda Carroll’s husband, I was blessed to know you when you came into our lives and home as the co-creator of One Story at a Time. Like so many others, to know you is to love you. I remember such sweet, short episodes of life with you, and warmth fills my heart as I write this. I send you great love and gratitude for all you have given, supported, made happen, and loved in life. Thank you for your great heart and everywhere it has taken you. Your goodness is not just for humans, I remember how much you tolerated our dogs when you sat with them in the back of the car and let them roll all over you with your usual humor and patience. Go gently into the great night, Peter. You have given so much, and the returns will continue always. Great love to you, Tim Barraud Dear Peter, my friend, my brother, I'm not sure I've ever told you that before we met and became friends, you were one of my heroes. On the steps of the High School of Music and Art, my first foray into music and any notion of doing it for a living was born out of my love for Peter, Paul and Mary. It wasn't just about the sound, it was about using music for social change, awareness and peace building. That was 1969! Fast forward 30 years when we met (thanks to Bethany) at the Kerrville Folk Festival. You paid me the ultimate compliment when you said \"Don't Laugh At Me\" is a song the whole world needs to hear. I was overwhelmed with joy when the trio decided to perform the song but the true icing on the cake was the birth of Operation Respect and my inclusion in a project that to this day is doing incredible work in teaching children about kindness, respect, friendship and being of service. You gave me the gift of seeing first hand how my work could and did make a difference. With all my heart, thank you for that. Getting to know you over the last 25 years has been such a blessing. Your faith in me has given me the courage to try all kinds of things. I will never forget working with you in Parkland FL after the shooting there, writing a song after the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, our work with Braver Angels trying to help people find common ground and countless more opportunities I had, to walk the walk that you have always walked! There's a quote I love that says \" maybe happiness is not about us, as individuals. Maybe it is not something that arrives into us. Maybe happiness is felt heading out, not in. maybe it's all about what we can give. \" Giving - That's something you know a lot about my friend. You have devoted your whole life to it. So many have tried to follow in your footsteps including me. I treasure the memories of our time at concerts, singing at conferences, schools and just for the fun of it. I still can remember how nervous I was at Town Hall when Mary couldn't make the show because of illness and you nonchalantly asked me if I would sing her part on \"Don't Laugh At Me\" with you and Noel. Of course I said yes but in case you didn't know, I was shaking in my shoes. I can still taste the late night food we consumed in 100s of Chinese restaurants, Italian trattorias and Jewish Delis. Recently we shared a salad together in our token attempt to eat healthy. In 30 years, you never let me pick up a check damnit. You said it brought you joy to treat people to a good meal. More giving... On a funny note, remember when we tried writing a sequel to Puff? I knew we were good friends when I had the chutzpah to insist that you give me your phone before we started working on it because I didn't want us to be interrupted by the 25 calls you'd probably get in the three hours we had scheduled. You stood your ground saying \" I will not give you my phone but I will agree to only take calls from very important people\". I thought to myself : How many important people can one guy know who would call in the next three hours? You only took four calls - John Kerry, Gloria Steinem, John Garamendi and Norman Lear. Still cracks me up... Recently, I got to see you twice. The first time was in Monterey at a wonderful show you and Noel did together where once again you so graciously asked me to sing a song. The last time was in NY where we spent a wonderful time eating that salad followed by a Lincoln Center coffee shop visit where I had you all to myself for two and a half hours. Heaven on earth! We talked politics, Israel, music and life. At one point you told me that when it was time for you to go, you were ready. At peace with your life and what you had done with it. I remember thinking that it was understandable given you had done more than any ten people I know. The gift of knowing you, loving you and truly \"getting you\" in a way that rubbed off on me and how I live my life has been such a blessing Peter. I will carry your smile, your love and the torch you lit long ago as long as I walk this earth. You have my word on that. May your journey wherever you're heading from here bring you much peace. I'm uploading a song I wrote with Allen Shamblin called \"Good To Go\" which I truly believe when it's time, you will be. Change the word Daddy to Buddy and every word fits you to a T. I love you my brother. ​ - Steve Seskin There are so many stories since I first met you (Peter) when I was a New Folk at Kerrville in 1974. You music and activism had inspired me from my early teens on. During my time in the Texas Legislature, I always tried to keep your mantra of finding the humanity in everyone, even those you disagree with, in my mind and practice. I appreciated your coming out and singing to my campaign volunteers after the concert when we brought them to see P, P & M in 1980. I have enjoyed the many opportunities to sing with you (and with Christopher) at Kerrville and especially when I sang for you at your 50th birthday party in Austin in 1988. My favorite story, though, is my 15 seconds of fame. We were in NYC visiting Sharon's recently retired rabbinic partner from her Buffalo congregation when we learned about the Pete Seeger tribute concert that you and Bethany had helped organize. We tried to see you before and then after the concert but security wouldn't let us through. We then walked a few blocks away with the Rabbi and his wife to find food and saw you standing outside a restaurant that opened up onto tables on the sidewalk, talking to someone there. We went up to you and you hugged Sharon with your usual \"My Cantor\" and then me with a loud \"Paul\". We introduced you to the Rabbi and hi wife and chatted for a few minutes but they wanted to continue on to find a less busy place to eat. I stayed and we talked for a few more minutes, but as I left, I heard someone at one of the tables inside say, \"Do you know who that is? That's Peter Yarrow.\" And then one of his tablemates chimed in, \"And that one is Paul!\" I guess I looked a foot taller. Peter, I hear your voice in my head all the time. Your example and your friendship have been repeated highlights in my life (I've also appreciated the many chocolate birthday cakes at Kerrville.) You have worked ceaselessly to repair the world and have made a difference in the lives of so many. May your days be peaceful and surrounded by love. Paul (and Sharon and Nathan) Colbert Peter, How long has it been? I counted and am surprised that it’s been 57 years since I first met you in 1967. I was just a teenager then. You were a big star, a member of one of the most popular groups in the US, and also in Japan. Yet, when I met you for the first time in the lobby of Hotel Okura, you spoke to me in a very polite and friendly manner, not blaming me for my ignorance about your songs or anything. At the time, I didn’t have any of your records (singles) let alone albums. Since then, we spoke a lot, most of the time you were asking questions about me, my school life, Japanese lifestyle, and so on. I really enjoyed and appreciated each of those moments. In 1970, you brought Mary Beth with you and proudly announced that she was three months pregnant. Then there was a twenty-year hiatus. When I saw you again in 1990, we had gone through a lot in life, and we both had a wonderful time sharing each other’s stories. Remember when you flew into Japan from Hong Kong, and hurried to the venue where the PP&M fan club was holding a Festa? How the audience got excited when you walked onto the stage to finish Puff sing out! Remember when Kenzo Tomotoshi took us to the fish market? Kenzo treated us to an exquisite sushi lunch. So many memories and memories. I always admired your activism, and though on a much smaller scale, I will continue to act for peace, equality, justice, and conserving the environment. I strongly believe that I had such a good luck in having you as my mentor. You have inspired me to be strong and honest as well as humble. Thank you, Peter, for leading me. I promise I will keep on living my life to the fullest. XXOO Andi Ogawa Japan My dear brother Peter, We first met 18 years ago, the Hebrew numeric for ‘chai’ or ‘life’. You breathe life into us all. Somehow, you walk into a room and whether there is 1 person, 100 people, or a crowd of 1,000 - each person feels personally embraced by you, personally affirmed by you. As for me, as we became close friends and brothers over these years, you taught me how to feel new levels of compassion for others, to tilt the scales toward mercy while fighting for justice. To notice the unnoticed. To lift the unlifted. You model the virtue of humility, and how it opens us to love. We have also unraveled between us the uniquely Jewish side of life, and its ever-unresolved challenges - you delving deeply into your generational family story, and feeling closer to that story as the years unfolded. And me, confiding in you the challenges of being the son of a survivor of Auschwitz, and my personal struggle against darkness and toward faith. Of you dear brother, I always asked myself how could one human being be such a masterful artist, teacher, activist, friend and so much more, all at the same time? How could one human being touch so many lives so deeply? Your life has answered those questions for me. I have never met anyone remotely like you. While most people know you through your enormous musical gifts, those of us who have been fortunate to have you in our lives are also inspired by your activism, and how you have woven the values of your music into acts of justice and lovingkindness, day in and day out. I love you, my brother. You are my model and mentor. What a gift you are to me and to so many others. Your love and friendship have changed my life. With unending gratitude and love, as ever… Larry I sang on stage with Peter Yarrow!!!! Yes, I can, in all truth, tell my friends and family that I sang on stage with Peter Yarrow. You came to Corvallis, Oregon and gave a concert at Corvallis High School, in part to celebrate the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship becoming a Sanctuary Church for immigrants. During the last song, you invited audience members to join you on stage to sing with you. I was one of many who accepted your invitation. I was thrilled! I was a fan of Peter, Paul and Mary since I was a teen and had so many of your albums. My sisters and I sang and danced to the music for hours. They were quite impressed when I told them I sang on stage with you. Best brag ever! Thank you. Thank you for your music. Thank you for your generosity. Thank you for your hilarious sense of humor. You have brightened so many of my days. And you will continue to do so. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! ​ - Melinda Sayavedra Peter, our most magnificent and loving dragon, You have done more that any artist/activist we have ever known, to tirelessly use music and love to make the world a better place and to help all of us aspire to be the best we can be. We are awed by how you have done this with unlimited generosity on a global scale for decades. Whether it was singing in Birmingham, organizing a march in Washington or a concert at Shea stadium, getting arrested in front of the South African embassy, filming in Central America, hopping on countless planes to prop up democracy or sing for sick friends, quell bullying in schools around the world including hot spots like the Ukraine and Palestine, and unite a divided country… not to mention support PBS and enrich it’s programming…no one has done it so well and with such talent and a loving, joyful spirit as you! PETER YOU ARE UNIQUE!!!You helped change the world and influenced important social and political movements in hugely important and measurable ways. Our friendship and work together has been one of the greatest gifts in our lives. Countless and memorable collaborations including after midnight edits and mix sessions, concerts and dinners fueled by oysters, Chinese food, wine, milkshakes, jokes, jamming, skiing up at Prospect Bowl, operas and, lots of hugs and laughter. We did well as a team…but you made it all possible, your vision, your impeccable ears, and world class talent. A thousand thank-you’s for letting us into your world. For us it was a privilege and an incredible ride. We were amazed how you also found so much special time for your wonderful family and hundreds of friends, …and the Trio, Operation Respect, Newtown, Parkland, Braver Angels and so much more. To accomplish this you frequently worked all night and did it all again the next day. Just to get it “Peterized” and perfect. What a big and important load you carried. Most people don’t know how much magic the dragon toiled at because he was always a menche and worked just as hard spreading his love and making us laugh and sing in public. (Just a side note from Jim: )I stood in line to get to get your autograph at County Center when I was 12. I think PP&M were my only autographs. You have been in my life since 1960. SO I was comforted to see your whiskered face peering at me from a few inches away at like 6 in the morning in a recovery room a few years ago… coming to after a piece of my lung was removed. It is an indelible image. You helped me select just the right surgeon and everything turned out fine. We were shooting together at a Braver Angels convention a week later. Brothers… Seeger’s Raiders…oyster eaters!!! We will always be there for you and carry your love, mission, and music in our hearts and in everything we do. WE ARE FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR OUR DEAREST FRIEND! Hugs and sloppy wet kisses forever. XOXOXOXO Lots of Love, Jim and Heather Peter, you are responsible for my relationship with my father. You turned out to be the perfect person to play liaison between Barry and me. Years of indifference towards him and some bitterness dissolved fairly quickly. As you explained, he was charming, funny and a wonderful story teller. All of that was true and I had a great afternoon with you, Barry and even Albert. My father and I maintained a relationship till his passing and I throughly enjoyed the man he was even with his faults. I appreciate that you took the time to make that journey with me. Thank you for making that day possible. Thank you for having my history and know I love you. -Alicia Travers Bonney- In November 2014, my home burned to the ground and I lost everything. A day or two later, standing in front of the smoldering ruins, my phone rang (I had escaped the fire with it) and I was amazed to hear Peter’s voice. We were well acquainted from numerous backstage visits and I’d had the pleasure of attending one of the benefit concerts he hosted periodically in his New York apartment. But I was amazed, stunned even, that this man, so busy and involved, with thousands upon thousands of fans and friends, would take the time to call me and offer his help if needed. A few years prior, just weeks after I’d suffered a heart attack, I went to the Mariposa Festival in Orillia Ontario where he was headlining, and maintaining his usual frenetic schedule. Peter took the time to sit and chat a while, enquiring about my health, and I have a treasured photo of us sitting together that day (thanks Mike Giovinazzo!). Peter was always so, so generous with his time and friendship, and gave everyone his attention. I once asked him how he managed to keep up the pace and he replied that he was blessed with the ability to get sleep anywhere, anytime – on a train, in a limousine or on a plane – and it kept him going. Peter has been one of my (very few) musical heroes, and has been a hero in every respect – speaking for those who do not have a voice, teaching, entertaining, and so much more. Unknowingly, he’s been a mentor, a role model and teacher to me and I’m sure countless others. The trio’s music was the music of my youth and helped shape my life, my ideals and my passions. I’m so fortunate to have had Peter Yarrow as a part of my life. ​ - John Lodge November 21, 2015 Peter and Christopher (and Mustard's Retreat) came to Kitchener Ontario to play for the 10th anniversary of our concert series. It was a wonderful night, as our singing audience raised the roof with Peter's direction. Peter had declined to eat before the concert, preferring to get Chinese food after the show. Well, by the time we got out, there was an Ontario blizzard happening and a foot or two of snow blowing around. We slip-slided our way to the restaurant by midnight, only to find they had closed early due to the storm. (Kitchener is not New York!) Peter was still needing dinner, so we slid our way back to our house, and Lori pulled together a \"Chinese-ish\" bunch of appetizers that suited him just fine. We also gifted him a 10th anniversary mug made by Lori (shown in the last picture). We hope he remembers our adventurous night whenever he uses it. A mighty fine night it was. ​ - Jack Cole My dear Peter, 61 years since you expressed interest in contact lenses to cousin Leon! My Dad subsequently fitted you. We were given concert tickets and an after-party invitation to celebrate \"Peter Paul & Mary\", the trio's first album. THAT was OUR beginning. You've worn many hats for many people, but above all else, for me it was your \"friend & confidante\" hat. I have very few unsaid words for you, Peter. Over the past 5 years (since Pat's passing), I've shared old pictures and anecdotes that attest to our long friendship. You have often been my rock and voice of reason.You've been part of my life longer than anyone else. The thought of never again speaking with you or hearing your laughter, brings a sorrow I've only known as a widow. How blessed I have been to have had your friendship for most of my life. To me, you have always been my friend, first and foremost. I know you've touched thousands of lives personally, but because of your selflessness, when we shared time, you always made me feel as if I were YOUR only friend. I hope your grace and courage throughout this battle will always serve as guidance for me, as I continue my own journey. You are SO loved. I know you KNOW that, yet I still need to say it just one more time. The void your absence will leave can never be filled. Thank you for being such a constant in my life and for extending that to Joanna as well. I will not say goodbye, for not one of us knows what lies ahead. Go gently, my dear Peter, and be truly free. I will always hold to seeing you in the golden sun of eternity. No pain, no suffering... only love and peace. I love you forever and always. Your friend, Joanie Pelzer Along with a few friends from Rancho La Puerta, she accompanied him to a concert for migrants at a shelter. People were arriving en masse on caravans, and both she and Peter had presented at “the Ranch” just the week before. He had attended all her talks, asking profound, educated questions about love and communication. It wasn’t until a few classes in that she realized he was part of the legendary trio she had gone to hear in 1962 at the College of Marin. (she knew him then as “Peter, Paul and Mary”) That concert in 1962 had been transformative. It was the first time she understood how music could speak to her soul. She went home, replaced her Paul Newman poster with one of Peter, Paul, and Mary, and played their records on repeat, feeling as if they were speaking directly to her. That connection to their music stayed with her—and she passed it on to her friends and family. When she heard Light One Candle in 1986, she knew she’d found a guiding song for her life. Now, decades later, she sat beside him, ready to sing for the migrants—to support and uplift fellow humans who had suffered unspeakable hardships. During the concert, she noticed a girl sitting beside her, wearing tattered clothes and flip-flops. Despite her circumstances, the girls’ gaze was clear, her smile pure. She seemed to shine with a quiet resilience. After the concert, she turned to Peter. “That was a great concert, but we need to talk about something else,” she said. “This girl—she just got off the caravan from El Salvador. We have to keep her safe.” “Who is she?” he asked. “Judith,” she replied. “How can we keep her safe?” “I don’t know, Peter,” she admitted. “But we have to.” She was speaking from a place deep inside her, not logical or reasonable but intuitive. Peter understood instantly. “Let’s start a non-profit,” he said. “We’ll raise money for the migrants—and keeping her safe will be central part to our work.” Neither of them doubted they could do it. The next day, they founded One Story at a Time, arranged the first concert in her hometown of Corvallis, Oregon, and helped Judith’s family find shelter, safety and a new life. From that first connection, One Story grew, offering safety, education, and hope to countless people in need. Orquesta Guadalupe was born under the dedicated care of Ron Wakefield, several kids were encouraged and then sponsored to finish school and go on to college , medical needs were cared for, eyeglasses purchased and a badly burned child was supported to go to Shriners in the USA. Along the way, the two of them forged a friendship so profound that they became part of each other’s families. Their bond was unshakeable, filled with trust and honesty. In their darkest moments, they called each other. In brighter times, they shared bad jokes that were always funny. When she turned 80, Peter promised he would be there. True to his word, even as the cancer moved swiftly, he set up a Zoom call from NYC to Portland. He filled the room with his magic, exuberance, and unwavering belief in peace and kindness. He made everyone laugh and weep at the same time—it was his special gift. My darling Peter, because of the work you have done all your life, and despite those who have tried to extinguish it, your light has never gone out. And it won’t now. Even as you leave us, it will continue to shine through the millions of lives you’ve touched and cared for. One of the deepest blessings of my life is our friendship—knowing your beautiful family, making mischief, and creating magic together for so many years. ​ - Linda Carroll My Brother, word has reached us that your challenges are great and that your spirit is indomitable. I am glad and honored to be among the cohort of your loved ones, collaborators, and allies, and to contribute something for you at this time. The message is simple: I love you; and in this declaration I speak for Liam and Katrina who know of what I speak and do likewise. I have been invited to remenisce with you about our times together now measured in decades: from our firsrt collaboration with Rod Kennedy (who would be here had he not gone before) over the Napa Folk Festival. Do you remember the night our dear Odetta was having so much fun that she wouldn’t leave the stage? or the day you married me and Katrina in the park; don’t forget the wedding ring you found for me and the hilarious way you carried away my ring size with a trinket-ring purchased at a seedy deli near the bus stop where we were awaiting the airporter; to the extraordinary trips to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Viet Nam; to the seranade (Day Is Done) we gave to Alex in his cell over the telephone the night before his paarole hearing; to the dress rehearsals before Carneigie Christmas programs; to the gifts you were always finding for Liam; through love affairs and painful breakups; the incubabtion of Don’t Laugh At Me. It is hard to stop. Where does the list end? It doesn’t. Remembering that memories are inherently retrospective, and that there is also the future, I remind myself that over the decades we have been absent from one another far more days than not. But I have not felt apart from you during those absences. I have always been able to find you in the light dancing in the trees, and grass, and flowers, and - of course - in the music. This togetherness I do not expect to leave you and me - ever. With all our heart, Bro Gene, Katrina, and Liam I’m 72 and you’ve been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember. As a teenager, you made me think about war on a very personal level, “Cruel War,” “Where Have All the Flowers Gone”. Then my next door neighbor in the small town where I grew up and everyone felt like extended family, was killed in Vietnam. “Blowing in the Wind” In college I sold my viola to buy a guitar so I could play and sing. I bought all your cassettes and later, CDs. I got my first teaching credential when schools were cutting music from the curriculum. For the next 21 years, my students, from 6th grade through high school, would sit on the floor learning many of your songs from stapled copies of a mimeographed song book. I especially want to thank you for one particular song, “Weave Me the Sunshine.” It has been my musical mantra through many hard times and I am so grateful! A few years ago, I saw you and Paul at Freight and Salvage in Berkeley, California. The entire concert filled my heart to overflowing, but when you sang, “Weave Me the Sunshine,” I felt like you were telling me for a lifetime to keep faith and hope, to carry on in goodness and love! Thank you, Peter Yarrow, for your profound influence in guiding and strengthening me to help the light of this world to grow. In love and gratitude, Cathy Lair Hi Peter, Chris Chandler here There are so many ways that you have touched and impacted my life, not the least of which is the admirable way in which you put your activism so squarely in the middle of your art. I have always seen you as a role model kind of tried to emulate the importance of the message in the art that I create I am also deeply appreciative of the way in which you went to bat for me at the Kerrville folk festival, even agreeing to let me release a live recording of one of our performances. Performing with you has been one of the highlights of my life. Also recording Our mutual, dear friend Anne Feeney‘s important song. Have you been to jail for justice? Is something for which she was most pleased. The visibility that you gave her helped the two of us find more rewarding work and helped get our message out to larger audiences. My life is much richer and Fuller because you are in it. Thank you for helping me to become the person that I am. I love you Chris Chandler Dear Peter, “Thank you” just doesn’t seem to cut it when talking about someone who has been there for someone without having any idea. I was just a kid and I needed something; something that would help me put our crazy world into some sort of perspective. And then I realized that the “answer is blowing in the wind.” Thank you for your heart, your love, for singing “bring back the baby, she’s part of the song” as I was walking my crying 9 month old out of your concert in 2001, thank you for your hugs throughout the years and for letting me indulge in sharing pictures of my grandson, Levi on text. Thank you for agreeing to sing with Caitie last year. It meant so much to her family and to me. Thank you for being the catalyst for Rich and me to meet Sherrie Rosenberg. Your influence, music, and acts of love and kindness will carry on through everybody you’ve touched. You are such a beautiful soul and I thank God we have been blessed to come in contact with it. It is now intertwined with mine. Love you so much. Brenda and Rich Goldman Hello Peter, It's been a long while since we last spoke. I'm very sorry to hear that you've been ill. You have definitely been in my thoughts lately. I want to thank Bethany and Christopher for their thoughtfulness in reaching out to your extended family and friends across the land, around the world via this social media connection to be able to reconnect and show how much you are loved by so many. Throughout the decades of your life and ours, with your tireless dedication, thank you for unselfishly standing up and giving a voice for others through your voice and music...you are truly a gift. Behind your gentle kindness, soft spoken calming voice and sparking smiling eyes is a powerful tsunami of awareness and overflowing passion for your fellow man, woman and the Earth. I'm so glad that one of those waves passed my way back in 1990. Seeing you at the festival over the years was always a sweet blessing and I'm glad that my daughter and I could call you \"family.\" Much love to you and your family. ~Shirlynn~ I am so sad to see this news. One of my fondest memories was meeting Peter and Noel Stookey with you during your visit to Los Angeles when we went to the Writers’ Guild Theater. The songs they sang that night, some of which I had not remembered hearing, deeply touched my heart. I have never forgotten the feelings I experienced listening to them sing and speak, along with Theodore Bikel. Later, receiving the correspondence you and Peter shared made me realize the depth of his commitment to humanity, in addition to his musical gifts. Such a rare, loving and giving man. A true mensch, with a beautiful neshoma, whose life has enriched mine forever. I hope and pray that in Peter’s remaining time here he will be surrounded by love and comfort, knowing that he has truly made a difference in this world. Love and prayers, Aimee Dear Dear Peter, I saw you first in Denver CO around 1965 at a performance and I, along with everyone else was drawn to an undefined powerful energy field. Next, thanks to JK I met you on the Upper Wharf and your first for me a sing at Pony Pasture. Your visits to Shore House are in my heart with music, many jokes passed back and forth and when you cooked, delicious dining. You are a treasure in my heart. And then you gave up your wonderful home to fund raise for Arnie Arnesen For her run for GOV in NH. you also performed in Portsmouth NH where you stayed to sing after the main event sang and met with all the volunteers from her campaign. Sterling College was another time at your place with your singing and Jed playing the spoons! Thank you again. Your warm and kind generosity extended to our children as well. You are one of a kind and made the world a better place and certainly a wonderful friend. A big hug and lots of love always, Perry Williamson Thanksgiving 2024 Peter, my bro… My first memory of you was at a P.P.M concert in Salt Lake City 1965! Shortly after, Perry saw you in Denver. We were comparing or memories of that this morning. She’ll provide hers. Mine was joy, awe, and appreciation. Didn’t see you again until summer of 1972 on Naushon, where you, John Kerry, and George Butler had landed for a short break from your efforts with Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Your presence resulted in a good gathering for singing with family, and fun visits on walks and at Shore House, among other things. I even got to play spoons with you at the sing. So going forward, I could say, “Sure, I played in concert with him…” Memorable events together include more Naushon visits, the Arneson for Governor of NH campaign (Perry will fill in here), your hosting a fundraising event for us at our apartment when we were at Sterling College. The occasion was the opening of the iMax Endurance and Caroline Alexander holding forth at the Museum of Natural History, where Shackleton’s lifeboat “James Caird” was on display. You sang for our invited guests – and inspired some contributions! We will never forget the surprise you gave us by coming to Sterling College in 2006 to sing for the graduating class, their families, our board, and us in this, our retirement year. A total selfless surprise! And I got to be in concert with you again – playing spoons! Our last breaking of bread together was after a performance you and Paul did in Lebanon, NH in 2019… Sad that we did not have a chance to meet in person again, but grateful for being able to stay in touch. Your contributions to bringing different cultures and thereby steps forward toward world peace will live on – as will our remembrances of you and our many times together. Love always, Jed… Peter - I have been blessed to know and work with you for about fifteen years, although I have been a fan for my whole life. Your steadfast commitment to making the world a better place through song and activism is truly inspiring and it comes from the kindest of hearts. I’ve always loved the “sound” of the early PPM records, so I suppose I have you to partly thank for my becoming a sound engineer. And since 2003, my work at WFUV has enabled me to collaborate with many of my musical heroes. It has been my highest honor to mix sound for you not only in the studios of WFUV, but also at concert venues and special events in the New York area. Each and every time was a joy. I cannot thank you enough for your unwavering friendship, support, and encouragement over the years. You are a giant among men, and you truly mean the world to me. With gratitude, Jeremy Rainer I’ve known Peter for 71 - perhaps 72 years. At Music and Art High School he was a pretty annoying kid - But then he morphed into a brilliant songwriter and passionate fighter for the ideals we treasure. Peter is the most empathetic iconoclast who ever graced Planet Earth! When I was at home with my three year-old daughter on August 28, 1963, I watched Peter, Paul and Mary sing their hearts out at the March on Washington. For civil rights, for anti-bullying, for Jewish causes (e.g. “Light One Candle”), Peter fought the good fight. What a life! We love you, Peter Yarrow. ​ - Isabelle Ganz Peter, For more than 40 years we have been friends. My family grew up with “Uncle Peter” and now my grandson listens to your music in Israel. There will be many who will eloquently discuss the impact your music has made on generations of listeners and activists. I just want to praise and thank you, my friend. Together, we’ve been on a journey blending Judaism and activism. The Torah commands us to be pursuers of justice. No one I know has embodied this principle in every aspect of life. You are an example for me and millions of others who seek justice in a very painful world. You’ve been there… Been there for so many people and causes. And… You’ve always been there for me and my family. Long before my move east, I knew I always had a place to stay in NYC. You (and Penny) were kind and welcoming hosts. Most of those visits included time with Vera, z”l (of blessed memory) and dinner at some new restaurant. When Shira and Avi were born you were there for both to celebrate and rejoice with us. Somehow you found time to be there for each of them as they became bat and bar mitzvah. As the kids got older, you developed a relationship with each of them independent of their father. Our lives are deeply intertwined. So much so, that you sang at my wedding to Eve. We would occasionally join you for Thanksgiving in Manhattan and you are a frequent guest at our seder table (this year joined by MaryBeth!). We had some crazy moments together. I still recall a call late at night to have me hear a new song that led to the Don’t Laugh at Me Foundation and years of important work and blessing. We merged our activist lists for any number of good causes. You have always surrounded yourself with so many wonderful people including friends like Al Vorspan, z”l, David Broza, and so many others. For me and my family, you are always Peter, not the singer, recording artist, activist, etc.… just Peter. A steadfast and loyal friend with whom we share laughs, challenges, good times and bad and always, always… you are there. Love you my friend. Elliott Kleinman Dear Peter, My ears recently found their way to your music and my mind and spirit have relished in its messages. My two favorite songs of yours are \"The Great Mandala\" and \"The Young Grow Younger Every Day\" from Burt Bacharach's Futures album. I especially enjoy your performance of the former with the late, great Richie Havens. Last year I watched it regularly on YouTube. \"The Young Grow Younger Every Day\" takes me back to a time I've never known, yet allows me to feel as though I am there. Your songs have provided me with refuge and comfort. I thank you for your musical contributions to our world. You have made life here a more pleasant experience for so many, including myself. All love, Victoria Hart My father, Tim Michels, introduced me and my daughter, Cheyenne, to Peter at a small show in Zumbrota, MN. He, and his son Christopher, were amazing in talking with us and sharing memories they had of my Grandpa, Dr Roger Michels. They also had my daughter on stage...and I have photos of Peter holding my girl. They gave her a beautiful book of Puff the Magic Dragon that we still cherish 10 years later. His memory will live on through his music, his stories, and memories such as these. So thankful I got to meet him and have just a small glimpse into the amazing light he blessed the world with. From Jerusalem to New York, I have had the deep privilege to witness and participate in many of your peace-willing performances. To stand beside you and sing your songs along the pantheon of social justice melodies that you keep, fulfilled me in ways that my younger self only dreamed. Palestinians, Israelis and others believed in a shared future because of your efforts and music. Though the times of peace look bleak, I still believe and sing their truth. I have you to thank for this. You once called me a \"child of Woody Guthrie\" and can I hope to live up an ounce of this blessing. May the words of Rumi comfort you, \"Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I'll meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass, The world is too full to talk about ideas, language, even the phrase each other doesn't make any sense.\" ​ - Ami Yares Ahh, Peter, where to start? At the beginning I guess…1965 was my first PP&M concert in the old Sydney Stadium in Australia. I was 17, very young, very naive about concerts. I’d never heard of backstage passes, even autographs. I thought you went to the concert, thought you’d gone to heaven, then went home and waited for the next tour in 12-18 months time. I came from a small town, so I guess I can be excused…. So, after a number of Sydney concerts over the next four years, I started travelling, and have never stopped. I was picking apples in 1970 on an Israeli kibbutz when someone got word that PP&M had broken up. Say it isn’t so! More years travelling, some time back in Australia, more travelling, all the time working to pay for the travel… Fast forward to December 2005, Mary’s comeback concert at Carnegie Hall. after her leukaemia treatment. Now, I don’t do winter. But, there can be exceptions and this was to be one. What a joy! After the concert, I approached Peter as he was leaving, garbled something like “I’ve come from Australia for the concert”, to which he replied “come back to my place, I’m having some people over”. …..there were, I guess, over 100 people there: Operation Respect people, Senator John Kerry…and little me, made to feel as welcome and important as anyone else. Fast forward again ….my almost annual trips to North America invariably included concerts and equally invariably included being invited backstage before and after the concerts. Apart from the Covid years, I guess I saw at least 40 concerts. My most recent concert was in October last year at Lexington, MA. I’d hoped to catch up again in Ohio two months ago, but Peter’s health battles caused those to be cancelled. My most recent email was in July, still planning for those concerts, signed “much love, Pedro”. I’m a nobody. Just a kid from small town Australia who managed, for some obscure reason, to be included in the very broad “PP&M family”. For this, I will be forever grateful. But Peter, I have to mention: your attempt at an Australian accent is, well, simply dreadful. It needs a lot of work. Always happy to help out. You know where to find me. Much love, Carole Nash I was literally introduced to folk music the day I was born. My parents had Woody Guthrie’s “Songs To Grow On” the day they brought me home. Several years later sometime in the early 60’s, when I was around 8 years old, (in the heyday of the Civil Rights movement) they brought they brought me to a Peter, Paul and Mary concert. From that day on I couldn’t stop listening to PP and M. Peter’s soothing tenor and captivating voice was always comforting, especially in times of duress. Then several years later I was asked to perform at concert in Central Park. We went on right before PP and M. After our performance, while leaving the stage, Peter walked up to me, put his arm around my shoulder and said “great set! You have a beautiful voice. Keep on singing on..” I never wavered in my love and admiration for Peter Yarrow, the awesome tenor, his true compassion for humanity, his constant activism to save our planet from the ravages of war, climate change and all things evil! Though I never did get a chance to have him in my radio show, I have always held Peter Yarrow in high regard and always got a chill whenever he, and Paul and Mary were on PBS. To this day, Peter has always represented the best in humanity. Keep on, Peter, keep on!!!! With all my love and admiration, always!!! ​ - Jon Stein I believe that Peter and PPM were my first introduction to folk music. They exemplified the power of music to engender / communicate a deep spiritual connection through the synthesis of word, composition & performance emblematic of the idiom, 'More than the sum of its parts.' Peter & PPM had the unique gift to elevate a song whether of their own creation or written & composed by others. The earliest songs I recall are 'Puff the Magic Dragon' & 'Blowin' in the Wind.' Other tunes I'm quite fond of include: 'Music Speaks Louder than Words,' 'Jesus Met the Woman at the Well,' 'Don't Laugh at Me.' Perhaps my most favorite is 'The Great Mandala.' I am most grateful for how my life has been enriched ten-fold by Peter & PPM. (ANDREW SUSMAN) I have so many memories of Peter which start of course like many as a child and fan of PPM but as an adult as an activist I was fortunate enough to get to know Peter and then as SONiAs wife and manager I got to be friends with Peter thru Sonia. I was with her at kerrville folk festival when Peter walked her around the campfires to introduce her. He has always been so generous in his time to encourage young talent and even after performing that night he made sure everyone knew he thought they should hear Sonia. It’s something that we try to make sure we take the time to do ourselves and hope we make Peter proud. But one of my favorite memories is a personal day we spent hanging out in NY and as we sat at lunch at a little deli Peter gave us the new illustrated pop up Puff the Magic dragon which he had signed for us. He then proceeded to read the entire book to us right there in the deli. I truly wish I had video because I must have looked like my 5 year old self staring at this legend reading Puff the Magic Dragon to me. I love you Peter and if I were able to travel myself right now I would give anything to have one more hug. You have worked so hard for so long to make things better for all of us and I promise we will keep on working when you finally rest. You will live on forever in your legacy of love, activism and the community you built. So grateful to call you my friend. ​ - Terry Irons Several years ago during a performance at Kerrville with the Billy Jonas Band, Peter Yarrow sat in the audience to watch us. The following morning, I saw him at breakfast in the hotel and he stopped me as I walked by him. After some small talk, he asked me why I hadn't worn a dress onstage the day before. He smiled and teased, \"A woman should always perform in a dress.\" We laughed, and I explained to him that I had not brought any dresses with me on this particular tour. We happily chatted for a few more minutes and then said goodbye. That evening, we left Kerrville. A week later, I received a package from him. In the package was a beautiful blue dress. I still have that dress! ​ - Ashley Jo Farmer Dear Peter, For more than half of my life I have watched you on stage annually at the Kerrville Folk Festival. You are an inspiration musically as well as fatherly as my relationship has been more with your son Chris than it has been with you personally. But in your son, I have seen the potential for being a great Dad to my own sons. My youngest son Marlon is a lot like Chris. A shining light always on the search for his greatest contribution in the moment. Your music has been a inspiration to so many, but I believe that our real legacy is in how we raise and nurture our children and how they as beacons of light lead others to their own greatest good. You have done great work and shared the Love so that it can continue to grow. For that you have my greatest thanks and respect and I pray that when you decide to cross the road, there will be nothing but light and love in your path. ​ - Joseph Nipper Where do I begin, I do not remember a time in my life that didn’t have the trio in it. Dad worked for them all through the 60’s as their pilot and travel manager. I met Peter in 1978 at a concert in Santa Barbara. Little did I know the next time I saw him Dad would be dead (81) and I would be back stage in the Sydney Opera House (86) turning 16 being surrounded by the trio and Dick with all of them crying about his loss. It was from the stories Mary and “Uncle” Peter told of dad that I learned so much about him and about myself that night and on every additional visit. Working at folk festivals, Peter would always take time when he was there to catch up and tell me more stories about dad. Peter, I love you and am sending love and light your way and to Bethany, Christopher, and the rest of your family. Thank you for being a part of mine and my history. Your memories will always be for a blessing to me. XOXO Doc Shannon Stanek Oh, so many stories, so many memories. The Christmas/Chanukah concerts, the dinners, Fire Island, a special event honoring Peter at LaGuardia High School (aka the High School of Music and Art), West 67th Street encounters and impromptu sidewalk chats. Of all of the memories, the one that stands out most vividly goes back years, and involves our oldest granddaughter Julia. Julia was about ten years old at the time, and already an aspiring performer with an angelic voice. We were all at the Kovners for dinner when Peter joined us, as he so often did, carrying his guitar. Sarah introduced him to Julia and her parents, who were visiting New York from LA. Julia's eyes widened. \"Peter Yarrow?\" she intoned. \"Peter of 'Peter, Paul and Mary?' \" She was gobsmacked, totally stunned. Peter smiled, and asked her a few questions about herself and her aspirations to put her at ease, then asked if she wanted to hear a song. Did she ever! She was so excited at the prospect of hearing Peter sing that she could only nod -- vigorously. He sang \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" of course, and Julia was in heaven. With Peter's encouragement, she sang the chorus with him, and soon we all joined in, enjoying an old-fashioned sing-along. Julia, now 25 and making her way as an actress and singer in New York, was thrilled, and remembers the evening to this day. We do, too, not only because it was a magical (pun intended) moment, but because of Peter's kindness. He is not only a brilliant musician, but a warm, generous person who understood Julia's excitement and made an indelible and happy memory for a starstruck child. He will always live in Julia's heart and in ours. ​ - Max Frankel & Joyce Purnick It’s appropriate that I write this tribute to Peter on Thanksgiving Day because his friendship for some 50 years is one of the things that I’m most grateful for. I met him through our friends Carl and Debbie in California and when Peter, Mary Beth, Bethany and Christopher moved to New York CIty our friendship deepened. I often stayed at their apartment when they were out of town as a “homework helper” LOL. Besides his natural family, like so many, I felt a part of his extended one. There are so many memories of joining him at demonstrations at which he often performed with Petter, Paul and Mary or alone and celebrations, singing along at his concerts, laughing at our foibles and those of others, rejoicing when our favored politicians won and commiserating when they lost vowing to continue the good fight for those who work for social justice. I’m reminded of this quote from John Ruskin, \"What we think, or what we know, or what we believe is, in the end, of little consequence. The only consequence is what we do\" because it’s what Peter taught me through his example. His life and his impact on so many lives will always be with us. Siempre adelante! Margot Jones My wife and I have been long fans of Peter, Paul and Mary. We are currently watching the Holiday Celebration over and over on TUBI. That was a great performance. Continues to inspire us to this day. My wife sings Light One Candle endlessly and to all our neighbors through the walls of our apartment each time it is played or seen on TV. I think the Campfire CD is something like a pinnacle for Peter, Paul and Mary as it sums up well not only the years of your singing well together but what is most important for all of us in life--in this world and the next--namely, family, as you have emphasized and spoken and sung about also in all your performances around the world. So, we pray for your recovery and continued success and share your songs and CDs with others whenever we can. Sincerely, Eric and Barb Dohrmann. I first got to know Peter when we worked on an event together in 2020 for Georgia’s senate seat. He was as charming as could be from day one. He put so much thought, care, and intention into what he put out into the world. What started as helping Peter with best utilizing technology for his video, quickly became beautiful calls & voicemails just checking in on me and my family. When I was going through some health issues he connected me with a healer and even paid for our first session. He sent us artwork created by his family when we moved into our new home. He took me under his wing for a little while and showed me what it means to not stand up for a cause when it is convenient or timely, but how to engage on a daily level, never taking your foot off the gas, fighting for what is right. ​ - Kunj & Sara Shah My dear Peter, for twenty years we traveled the world with so many wonderful people on a special mission, Operation Respect. I'm so grateful that Bethany and the family and Tony have brought us together to share this feeling of gratitude for being in Peter's universe. I think it has given every one of us a deeper sense of purpose, love and joy. You showed me early on that the way that Peter, Paul and Mary brought their love and joy to the stage seemed to ignite the audience and so it was for the work of Operation Respect. It was magic. And I believed it. \"It's Magic\" is a less well-known song that truly inspired me. I am so grateful to have traveled this journey with you and with all who are writing and honoring you and who love you. We hope we can ease the burden and we will carry it on knowing that you will always be with us. We love you. - Mark and Janie Weiss Dearest Peter, You came into my life when I was a college student at UC Berkeley in the late 60’s. Of course, it was at a distance then, as your music was the background for my budding passion for social justice. Through your music and social activism, you represented the hope and possibility we could help make a better world. Years later, as I began work on bullying prevention in the school district of our small township of Bexley, Ohio, I was introduced to you personally by Irene and Lee Hess and Rich Stoff at a small breakfast in Columbus where you shared your work with Operation Respect and the “Don’t Laugh at Me” program. I was star struck. But you looked at me and said “Let me know if I can help. I will come.” I doubted how that might be possible given the breadth of your musical and political activity. But I didn’t know you yet. My team worked for months organizing the students and school staff to create art, conversations about kindness, learning to sing “Puff,” and planning. A community-wide evening program about respect, caring and kindness was the launch of “Bexley Operation Respect.” While it turned out you could not personally attend, you asked Bethany to stand in for you. Bethany came (nursing her three-month old Valentina) and worked with our students and staff with all the magnificent passion and creativity of her father. But Peter, you felt so badly for me and my disappointment in not having you lead our program, you came several days later just to visit and sing with Larry and me in our living room. That’s when I knew firsthand your empathy and concern for others were boundless. From that moment on, I have been blessed with your friendship and presence in my life and the life of my family. The memories of our times together bring me great joy. Thank you for this gift. I love you, Susan Steinman REMINESCENT BLESSINGS My love for the most wonderful folk group was prevalent almost immediately when I first heard “LEMON TREE” playing on the radio. The trio consisted of three talented and capturing voices giving warmth and love to all listeners. The woman's voice fit beautifully with her two male singers and included the tenor as well as the baritone blend brought interest and light into my life. After that I followed closely with this trio and occasionally learned facts about them. We are focusing today in the beloved tenor voice of Peter Yarrow. I always purchased the albums when they became available and thoroughly identified with the content of the songs and the spirit of folk music which warmed my heart totaly. The fourth album introduced us to live performances and we learned even more about them individually and as a success group. One thing that caught my attention was Peter's ability to bring the audience together as a group and enthusiastic participants warmed to the challenge. We also noted a surprise as Peter sang words of a French song and I personally was awed by that experience. My words remain as English based writing. As time passsed, I continued following my wonderful trio and was delighted when they participated in “THE JACK BENNY SHOW” two consecutive appearances. Added delight to my love for them I memorized so very many of the songs and my sister and I sang occasionallly from time to time. We also sang songs from other folk artists as well. I actualy developed a little talent for instruments that were of interest to me. I played bongos a little, also the auto harp and eukelele and finally developed a knack to play guitar. How I became a loyal enthusiast and that is said lightly because I truly allowed the music to enter my heart, soul and spirit. I was quite a basket case when this trio ceased singing and playing together. But they truly were, at that time, and remain an inspiration for me even after all these years. The care and love they truly showed us was a healing for my life and I can't describe it in any form to modify the depth I feel. Any time I think back to that time in my life, I realize that I have been very blessed and Peter is truly number one along with others and that emotion continues today. I will be adding more content to this historical story with this folk based rendition and it should appear soon. Love and blessigs, carlene It was so hard to hear re how Peter is doing... I've been feeling kind of glazed this week, thinking of Peters' uniqueness of spirit and integrity and really standing up for so many important issues, (the Civil Rights Movement March on Washington being a pivotal moment for him), in a way that also inspires others to do so, as well and his fun spirit and wonderful little pictures he draws spontaneously and the multitude of wonderful inspirational songs and impact over the years. I first got to know him, a friendship that started in the 80's, through talking with him about one of his songs that I wanted to share with others (at a future work event) after a concert (Light One Candle). He gave me a card to contact him about getting the lyrics, I left a message, thinking it was an office number, one day I get back, my roommate says, You'll never guess who called! It was Peter, they got into a conversation about her work as a special ed teacher, I called back, we spoke on the phone for an hour and also got together that night and by a couple hours later, spoke about many aspects of our lives. (I spoke of my work as a social worker at Fountain House, a revolutionary mental health program, which spurred an international clubhouse movement, effectively integrating people with major mental health challenges into work, education, and life in the outside community by valuing what each persons' unique talents and spirit were) very similar to the way Peter relates to people. He recalled that he was at college, considering psychology and doing music on the side and when he saw how much he was reaching people with music, switched gears to do music as his main thing. Peter has a unique quality of being an always friend. It didn't matter if we had last connected days, weeks, months or years ago, each time we talked, emailed, texted, it was as though we had just been speaking. It has a warmth, integrity and steadfastness to it and will always be treasured. Many years ago when I was volunteering overnight at a shelter, I heard and was upset about Iran having fired scud missiles into Israel, I called Peter and he helped me to feel less stressed about it, and after that call, the homeless guys staying at the shelter helped with that also. When his mother Vera was alive, I would sometimes visit her and true to her teaching background, would always learn something interesting from her. At one point, Peter passed on to me a piece of art given to him that he thought I would appreciate and as I knew my mother would love it, it ended up adorning my mothers' apartment, so that covers the mothers connection! Children-Peter, is like a pied piper in the way he relates to children at various events, especially at the PS 6 annual concerts (you would see drawings of dragons in the hallways). He so integrated kids into the process, so that at a young age, they felt appreciated and that they had a right to be there in their uniqueness. I was involved in connecting the Walkabout Clearwater Chorus to perform with him at a Clearwater Festival and we were in a PBS special program that he organized and that was done at Ethical Culture on the UWS and he made sure that I was included in that program. Over the years, I have raised some money from free will donations I asked people to give, at some of my events, to Operation Respect, an organization he has strong leadership in, creating harmony in the classroom and against bullying. (I also explored connecting for a while with Braver Angels, an organization that he was committed to, in relation to Walkabout and our connecting with a chorus that thinks differently from us, but that didn't end up being a direction the chorus wanted to go in at the time) While I have written a number of songs, as they are nowhere near the caliber of his songs, I did not feel comfortable sharing them with him... I did get to sing a couple of them (including one about gun violence) at Peoples' Voice Cafe this season and, as President of the Board of Peoples' Voice Cafe, I had also talked with him about his doing a benefit concert for Peoples Voice Cafe, which he had generously agreed to do. The one song of his that beats right in the center of my spirit is and always will be Sweet Survivor; with his determination to be a gentle and strong, clarion call for carrying it on, no matter what...cannot think of a message more important in these extraordinarily challenging times. At a Thanksgiving gathering with friends last night, without saying who it was for, after sharing the song Sweet Survivor, in relation to these times, I asked people, in relation to a friend who worked constantly to make the world a better place and was facing extraordinary challenges, to take a minute to close their eyes and hold him in light and love. The breadth of his spirit will always stay with me. Like the song Light One Candle, Peter continues to light candles in peoples' souls. I feel blessed to know him and have him as a friend With love, Bracha Who isn't a Peter Paul and Mary fan! Growing up in Montreal, Canada in the 70's, of course my parents had the \"Peter, Paul and Mary\" album and I became such a fan of theirs, and especially that album. I would stare at the cover while listening and imagine where that picture of the three of them up against that wall might have been taken. Fast forward to my living in NY City. As a musician myself, there was the first time I played The Bitter End. I stood there staring at that wall on stage and then of course, looked up to “THE” album hanging up on “THAT” wall. I couldn’t help but cry with a big smile on my face. A full circle moment for me that I will never forget. Throughout the years, I saw PP&M a few times. I also had the incredible opportunity to accompany Peter in a small showcase room at a Folk Alliance Conference. I then was working for the Northeast Regional Folk Alliance, and we hosted Peter and Noel. I will also never forget my first time at the Kerrville Folk Festival where my husband and I sat right beside Peter in a songwriter round and got to play a song while he listened. Our lives come full circle in so many ways. Now I read that his is coming to an end. Thank you, Peter, for your gift of music and for all the love and joy you brought to so many. Cheryl Prashker At the Kerrville Folk Festival, there was a camp named by the inimitable Tim Henderson as Camp Moco Verde. (For those non-Spanish speaking folk - Camp Green Booger) Every first Saturday night we had Bawdy Song Night. It was our excuse to drink copious amounts of Mescal, Tequila, Whiskey, beer.... or any other liquor for that matter... and smoke pot and sing bawdy songs. There were no rules. We warned everyone that walked up that this was a special night and that we'd be back to more tame singer/songwriter circles the next night. Every now and then, someone would sneek up from the shadows and be surprised by the unadulterated, uncensored songs. This was one of those incidents. I went through a \"spoof\" phase, spoofing a lot of different songs, making them pretty obviously dirty or off color. I had spoofed Puff The Magic Dragon - Biff The Tragic Drag Queen. As I was singing it - I should disclose here that I was under the influence of Mescal worms - a couple of people were trying to surreptitiously inform me of something... My clouded mind couldn't compute. When I was finished, a few people laughed nervously. Then I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked back and there stood Peter himself. He sighed and said,\"Graham, spoofing songs is a legitimate art form.......... but........... I really didn't like that one. Please promise me that you will never sing that song in public again.\" I laughed, but, through my mescal addled brain fog, I realzed that he was serious. So, I promised. And I have kept that promise. Peter has been such an inspiration to me. I had been playing Puff for decades. All my kids know ALL of the words and can sing them to their kids now. At one point, all of my girls have sung Puff with him on stage. Even my grandkids have sung with him. Those moments are precious to me. And it has been precious to them as well. I gave Peter a pecan for his 60th birthday. I told him to go plant it and make sure that it was watered so that when he was an old man, he'd have a shady place to sit and pick his guitar. On his 80th birthday, he said he didn't remember that, however, that is a lesson to remember to plant and care for seeds for the future trees... whether in the literal sense or a figurative sense. Thank you Peter for all of these precious moments and for the love you have spread through your lifetime. I love you!! Graham Warwick My mother would play Pat Boone or Elvis records on her small turn table that she brought from her real home with my grandparents. She'd order a pizza and just sat there ignoring me for hours on end. Every once in a while, she'd beg me to understand what it was that she was listening to ,but I well, just didn't feel anything. We had a neighbor, who I called Uncle Sid, who loved folk music. He played Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Peter, Paul and Mary. One day, as I was sitting in his living room, \"Motherless Child\" sung by Mary Travers came filling the space. I cried. Someone understood how I was feeling and it made a difference in my life. I get the anti war music and I get protest songs, but to me, the way Peter, Paul, and Mary just told a story reached down into my Soul bringing me pure light. Later on, I met a boy who I just loved with all that I am. And your music brought us to concerts, hours spinning songs together, and being happy in each others company. You helped me craft memories that last a lifetime. Music changes people. It changed me for the better. Music can change the world especially when we can all join voices and sing together. Although I never met you, know that your music and pure heart just filled my life in the darkest of times and into the light. Thank you. You made a difference for one little girl who just didn't belong anywhere. ​ - Andrea Perez In October of 2009 my brother David and I organized a \"get-out-the-vote\" rally at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland, OH. We were on the verge of electing our first African American president. We had a large and diverse slate of some of the best local talent. Peter and I had a mutual friend in Cleveland, Chuck Fink, and it was through him that I was able to contact Peter. I left a message at whatever number he gave me and didn't really expect much to come of it. I figured it would go through Peter's management or whatever and disappear. Imagine my surprise when several weeks later I heard Peter's voice - that unmistakable voice - on my own voicemail. Peter showed up. It remains one of my great privileges as a musician and as an activist to have shared the stage with one of my heroes that night. Thank you, Peter, for that and for all you've given us over a lifetime of service. ​ - Noah Budin Dear Peter, I met you only a few times, but the deep impression you left on me will last my lifetime. You were planning a concert for Native Americans in the midwest and wanted my assistance. My help was nothing compared to the work that you put into it. To me, your commitment to justice for all people was admirable not only in the words you spoke, but the actions you took. And that is of course on top of your artistry, for which you will have enduring fame. Indeed you are an immortal now. You have joined the ranks of those who time will not forget, and if anything, as technology advances, you will grow larger than life. In the years that come your music, your commitment to justice, will become all the more important. A steady keel to hold an unsteady ship the world has become. I am honoured to have met you. I am saddened to hear your time is near, but glad to know you will go with a glorious celebration, the celebration of a life well and justly lived, a glory that no riches can buy, and no power can take. May I see you again in the world that comes, so that you may inspire me more to do what is good and do what is right. Your friend, Alex Ewen I was a little kid probably 5. And it was Sunday morning and the sun rays were poring through my parents bedroom window across the hallway into my eyes waking me to the day and I turned around and in the morning sun beaming was the Peter Paul and Mary album in full color Movin’ with Puff and all his glorious friends. It was my very second album in my two album collection-The first was Herman’s Hermits. My uncle Kevin Gilles was Mary’s guitar player when PPM took a break in the early 70s. I met Mary and Mary her tour manager back stage at the then Capitol Center Arena when she was on tour with Seals and Crofts. Meeting them again at Kerrville Folk Frstival was wonderful. Being around Peter and Noel and Mary always feels like part real part dream because they made the path for me to walk in. Which I do every breath of everyday of my life. That music is a way out of misery and defeat and a way fortified possibility in equality love and peace. And that a guitar and a voice were all you need to walk on through the reign. I was just getting the love at Kerrville when Peter took me around the campfires where no logs are necessary and introduced me as the next PPM - never in my ever did I see that coming although - the magic of their spirits is quite aligned with the almighty and it doesn’t get better than that. Watching thousands sing out on their songs fills my heart with joy. Later a gathering in March 2001 to stop a military invasion of Iraq we sang together in the night with a misty light rain on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with PPM at the center and Bethany and myself and others praying and singing that no violence - no war- no more. The media was scared and barely covered this peaceful action. Even though there are 4000 protesters the news minimized this action and skinned us down to 400. I was there and that was simply not true. But fear prevailed. It was backstage that we heard the news that Rachel Cory had been mowed down and died in an occupation protest in Israel. I remember sitting next to Peter at the Threadgill theater and we heard Nic and Ellen’s song By My Silence. I turned to Peter and said you guys should record this song to which he said - “Sonia, You should record this song”. And so I did. My love for Peter and PPM is full of gratitude and gratitude and gratitude. I have learned so much and yet hardly begun. Love you always Peter. Love Sonia Rutstein Dear Peter, Meeting you at the Black Hills Unity Concert is one of the highlights of my life. You embody a different way of living as an elder with love and wisdom. This is something I hope to live up to in my own way. I'll never forget you leading the children in a sweet singalong onstage with Christopher and Bethany. Love was definitely in the air. In the game 'Who's the most famous person in your phone?' your name often makes me the winner!\" lol Even though we haven't talked in years, I think of you often. Your contributions to justice in this life are really too numerous to count. I'm so grateful that our lives have touched. Love to you and blessings on your journey, Donna Melcher If I had never met you, Peter, I would still love you for the music you gave to the world. Throughout my 20’s I was angry and sad, a lot; I would soak in PP&M’s music like medicine. Emotionally numb, I remember times clutching a boom box against my body, wishing the shear vibration of Mon Vrai Destin or 500 Miles or the Unicorn Song or Weave Me the Sunshine could--like a defibrillator--jolt me back to life. If you only gave this world your beautiful, hopeful, healing music, it would have been enough! But you wanted to know my story. Why didn’t my sadness drive you away? I came to realize it wasn’t entirely unusual for someone touched by a song to come pour out their heart to you. Peter, if you had offered kind words and encouragement to me one time, it would have been enough. But like Puff the Magic Dragon, who in the animated series would drop out of the sky to help a troubled child find perspective and courage, out of the blue you would call me to check on me. With you, I could laugh at absurdity. You gave me dignity. It took years, but I reached a place of peace. I knew on one level that you were a man who sang for John F. Kennedy, for Martin Luther King, for Cory Aquino and the Dalai Lama. You were flying around the United States helping raise money for good political candidates, making regular appearances to sing to hospice patients and other patients, then later flying around the world with Operation Respect. And yet you made time for me. I sometimes worried you were too giving and too generous and too trusting with strangers. I knew the fate of your friend Allard Lowenstein. But how could I tell you to dial it back when it was that very kindness that lifted me? I knew you were thoughtfully living the words of your songs: The longer I live the more I find that people seldom take the time To really get to know a stranger and make him a friend. Thank you a million times for taking that time with me, Peter, and so many others: backstage crowds, coffeehouse friends, activist friends et al. May those ripples of love and peace that you sent to all of us come flowing back to you, now; may you know they will forever swirl through this world, stirred by the wings of the thousands of little dragons you helped fly. Love, always. Dolores de Vera writer, teacher, union activist Dear, sweet Peter. I am flooded with so many memories of the past 50 years. Late night Japanese dinners with you and Mary Beth and a multitude of friends after concerts in Manhattan; visits with Vera; lunches with Penny; a summer night in Willmar with Mary Beth’s dad using his fogger to attempt to control the mosquitoes; Bethany and Christopher covered in sand at Broadbeach Road and many wonderful PP&M concerts. How fortunate I was to meet you through my budding relationship with your brother by choice Carl Rogers. A decade and a half later, in1984, you sat in our Venice, bungalow, cradling and singing to our newborn son. Fast forward to 2016, two weeks after Carl died you wrapped me in a warm blue shawl and a comforting hug before sharing a lovely meal at the Santa Monica Pier. Five months later, you once again flew across the country to sing Carl’s requests at his memorial. For us and so many others, you not only filled our hearts and heads with song, but somehow found time to be present for us as individuals. All the while, you were busy creating and nurturing innumerable organizations to give us direction and hope. I can’t imagine the world without you. We will have to somehow carry on… To walk in your footsteps to honor you and all you’ve worked for, for the world, we are leaving to our children and grandchildren… and all the children of the world. We will certainly get cues from your daughter and granddaughter. I send you and the family abundant love. I hope you are comfortable and that you are able to take in all of the love that you were surrounded by, both in person and digitally. I love you, dear Peter. Debrah Wiley Dear Friend Peter: “We are the boat. We are the sea. I sail in you, you sail in me.” As we were together with people from many countries, teachers from many places, many fields studying our environment at Land Between the Lakes in Tennessee, we sang together. Our hearts were joined there as we broke bread before we sang. Yet the words rang out that when we work together, when we feel together, we are the boat and the sea. We sailed together and we felt a kinship with one another. It mattered that our voices and hearts felt the need to be one to make our world a better place. The “magic dragon” spiriting us on to believe in the value of joining together in song. Because as you have reminded us, music does “speak louder than words” Going back to the workshop Mark and you did for 500 people in Operation Respect and the KY School Safety program at Murray State University; you Stewball to a group of those assembled. In the moment you asked someone to join you on stage, that person connected to their life and that song as you encouraged her to interpret the song in the context of her heart and mind. Instantly, without hesitation, she shared a very piquant moment in her life, something that was deeply seated. She shared how that song really connected to her life’s learnings, and it mattered. It was so seamless and an important moment that I recall it as though your song rang out and beckoned her to think, to feel, to see how the music and lyrics had a deeper and resonant meaning. I had asked if you would sing at the opening of the North American Association for Environmental Education. You led 1000 people in the audience with Bethany to believe in themselves to make a difference by working together, as they sang together. You beckoned us to join you on stage and sing. This Land Was Made for You and Me, as the chorus of dissonant voices joined one another in feeling the oneness of that moment. Never had I seen a moment where environmental educators and our association persons felt the need to have a common voice, the feeling that we can, when we take the time to feel our sisterhood and brotherhood. Your selflessness has made me think of the importance of the difference you have made in our lives. We have sailed on the sea of lives together. Each time I have asked for you help you have transcended any shortage you have had of time because there has never been a time when you have not found a way to spirit us together with thought and song. I hope you know how much I have valued your friendship and your willingness to help us to think with song how important it is to “work together”. It is interesting I was about to ask you if you had thought about a time when a group of people from across the globe could sing like “We Are the World,” the song, “Blowing in the Wind.” The need to encourage “oneness” in these times made me think of you as the “Magic Dragon” spiriting us into a global effort to sing and think and feel “together.” Uncanny that this came to me the other day as I thought of you and what you have done to help me and many others in environmental education. Surely I would be happy to help in any way in something along these lines. But this is not to ask you do anything, it is my attempt to be grateful on this Thanksgiving for your manifold gifts to me and many others. What is most important to me is to let you know how your kindness has mattered in my life and to those you have touched in my small sphere. Gail and I are sending our love because we have found that love and music are essentials to our lives and we know this also from the way you have spirited us on to believe in the value of love. I see more clearly now, “we are the boat, we are the sea, I sail in you, you sail in me. Sending to you from Gail and me our gratitude and love, Joe (Baust) I am writing to express appreciation for Peter Yarrow's great legacy of movement-building through music, and other means through which he has created and carried a lineage of ways to imagine and organize together for the greater good. I met him at gatherings hosted by his daughter Bethany at her home in upstate New York that were full of activists, artists, local community members, folks from far and wide, plenty of good people just looking to live their lives to help others, in offbeat and/or on-beat ways. It was fun, and actually there were important eco-justice initiatives organized there too! Peter shared songs and stories and deep words of hard-won wisdom and encouragement. We should not forget the courage it took to be fighting Jim Crow and racial terror in the deep South of the 1960s or to oppose the Vietnam War when so many powerful forces wanted to suppress the truth. Also, when he talks about contemporary social problems, he brings an intelligence about the need for healing and repair that is rare in today's polarized, and combative world. I also heard him share like this in New York City and in the Black Hills. Peter reminds us that creativity, humor and kindness nurture courage. He reminds us that adversity can strengthen character. And that we can grow our imagination in community. Through his beloved Mary Beth, Christopher and Bethany, he has radiated out a culture of loving family that is happy to enfold and include others from all walks of life. I am among the many who are grateful to Peter for his life's work. Sincerely, Karenna Gore Peter, Words can barely describe the impact you have had on my life. From the moment I met you - some 30 years ago when you called me in Columbus, OH. I came home one night from synagogue, and I asked if anyone called. William, then maybe 5, said someone called. When I asked who, he said he didn’t know. When I started to chastise him for not getting a name, he said, “but he told me to tell you that “Puff” called.” Without context, I didn’t know who it was. And then the phone rang. It was you and after an hour conversation, you invited me to bring our children to hear you present “Don’t Laugh At Me” to Columbus school teachers. And when I told you, “but it’s a school day,” you asked how many days do they go to school? I replied every day. And you asked, “And how many times do they get to sing with Puff?” Well, of course, we came. And when we walked in, though we had never met in person, you saw our kids - and welcomed Elana and William up to join you to sing Puff the Magic Dragon. When I saw the 3 of you up there, my heart melted. You were stuck with us as friends. Whether the times you stayed in our home, you played on the Shabbat before Elana became a Bat Mitzvah, when Elana worked for you, when Elana and I met you in Jerusalem, or when you played on the night before she and Noah were married, when you took time to meet my Confirmation class at a NY restaurant and serenaded them for an hour…my heart was filled with love and joy. Each time we spoke, you called me your brother (I know you had LOTS of brothers and sisters). But as I witnessed on so many occasions with others, when you were with me…you were with me 100%. And I felt embraced. I will be forever grateful that you came into my life…years after you made an impact with your music on Leslie and me. Our children grew up on your music before they met you. Then, they - too - came to know you and came to know your passion. Just three months ago, while spending time with our granddaughter and grandson, we sang Puff and told them about you. To have them learn your music brought unbridled happiness to us all. Peter, as the the poet Hannah Sennech wrote, “There are stars up above, so far away we only see their light long long after the star itself is gone.” Your light has shone on my family for all my 7 decades. And your light will continue to shine long into the future…for me…for my family…and for so many others. P.S. Elana just (day before Thanksgiving) gave birth to her first child, a beautiful baby girl. She - we - will sing her your songs. We will tell her our stories of you. And she, too, will believe in the magic of Puff. Here are three pictures that I cherish - you and me; and you and Elana at her wedding; and you serenading my mother-in-law the night before Elana and Noah’s wedding. All our love, Art, Leslie, Elana, Noah, William, and Ali (and our 3 grandchildren representing the next generation). Peter personally taught my father Denny to play the guitar when my dad was young. It was an experience my dad talked about and was very proud of. My father kept a handwritten notebook with songs and their chords including Peter’s songs and other folk songs too since that time, adding to it over the years. My father in turn taught me to play the guitar from the same handwritten notebook. It’s all I asked to have from him when he recently passed on. When I was old enough, as a young teen, my father took me to see Peter perform. By then I knew what an important and amazing person Peter is and the message he shares with the world. Weave Me the Sunshine is our favorite song, and our family theme song. It is the song I loved playing with my father the most. I hope to share it with my children. Thank you for contributing so positively to my family and the world. ​ - Susan Gladstone Dearest Brother Peter, I have been reflecting a lot about all the times I have been honored to be on the journey with you of sacred activism. Each day as I do my walking meditation, I have been bringing your presence along and will continue to do that for a while dear brother. We are a decade apart in age and you have been my guide of what the next decade of my life might look that if one faithfully commits to answering the call of what it is I am to do to continue heal the world. You embody such compassion and love Peter that you have been able to know from the deepest parts of your being, when, where and with whom you need to be with to do the soul work of the world. So many moments that have come to mind that I have been in your presence have to do with your deep love and commitment to the children of the world. Here are a few I remember: You choosing to spend your 50th Birthday singing to over thousand children in Prospect Park who were part of then Model Peace Education Program singing with them \"I am going to lay down my sword and shield down by the riverside, ain't goin to study war no more.\" Do you remember the time you beckoned me to come to a café in Greenwich Village as you took out your guitar and sang \"Don't Laugh at Me\" to me. You were holding a big vision of what could happen with this song and by the time we were leaving I was convinced it would happen and I needed to also answer the call in how I was to be used. That day Operation Respect started to become a living reality and as a result millions of children have been deeply affected by that work in the world and feel more loved, seen and heard as a result. Do you remember being in the Philippines singing to over two million people because you and Paul and Mary were invited to the anniversary of the nonviolent revolution and because those who were nonviolently marching before tanks were singing Peter, Paul, and Mary songs? And then to be able to gift President Aquino the 100 top essays from American children of what the nonviolent Philippine Revolution means to them. And finally visiting several other sites with you where children were waiting patiently to catch a glimpse of the three of you - and especially you because you used this opportunity to bring the message of nonviolence to thousands of American children first in doing that essay contest. As you approach this next threshold in the journey we call life dear one, may you take some moments to look back and see, really see, the thousands of children who are more loved, seen and heard because you chose to live a life of action and service in the way that you did. I love you dearly and know that you will continue to be a living inspiration to me and so many others that your work will continue to affect so many more children and adults forever. \"Some day we will all have perfect wings\" - you dear one are ready for that. May you feel deeply the depth of the love and compassion and renewed purpose people feel just by touching into your soul right now. ​ - Linda Lantieri Peter Yarrow has lived his life defying earth’s gravitational force beyond human boundaries and limitations. SpaceX’s recent advanced rockets and space travel - have nothing on Peter. “We are not human beings on a spiritual journey, we are spiritual beings on a human journey.” Teilhard de Chardin Peter - an unattached vessel through which the world seems to filter. He is a universal collective human archetype embodying the universe. “There is only one river There is only one sea And it flows through you And it flows through me” Peter IS the quintessential manifestation of “flow” - a state of consciousness of optimal experience transcending time and space without need of material possessions. A gregarious mystic. During Covid, Peter left Manhattan and stayed for many months at his assistant Tony’s house in upstate NY in a small sparse room with one window. He loved it. “This is all I need.” In 1979, I first met Peter in Rochester, MN when he was performing at a fundraiser for the Wilmar 8. He arrived with no idea where he would sleep but always knew a bed would surface - like a wandering monk. One of my fellow organizers asked if Peter could stay at my apt. We had recently moved to Rochester - only had a coat as a blanket and a sofa to sleep on. Peter could not have been more grateful - arriving late and leaving at the crack of dawn - quintessential Peter. To Peter, it’s only sleep - his focus is always on the cause. Thirty five+ years later, Peter stayed at my house in DC and once again slept on a pull-out sofa in the library - gratitude from Peter to have a place to lay his head - off we went in the morning to another cause. When you get near Peter or involved in any of his cause-driven projects, you are pulled in by a centrifugal force that whirls into a turbocharger animating anyone in its wake to respond immediately to whatever. is needed. For many events with Peter in Washington, DC (and there were many), I assisted in whatever way I could - also inviting everyone I knew and everyone I didn’t know - to get involved. Peter treated DC like his nearby neighborhood - location and time were irrelevant, and he miraculously always FINDS time in his busy schedule for everyone and every cause. Peter’s quintessential assistant Elizabeth Kolodny always kept Peter on track, and Peter’s schedule went smoothly with Tony Arancio, Peter’s steadfast logistician. Peter always found the time to say “yes”. I have never heard Peter say “no”, and if Peter is tired, he simply ignores it. In 1991, when I asked Peter to sing at the Washington Monument for the Peace Corps’s 30th anniversary for 7,000 RPCVs (Returned Peace Corps Volunteers), he accepted immediately reliving a cherished memory of PP&M’s March on Washington in the ‘60s. It was the highlight of the celebration. Peter is indefatigable - flying directly from the Middle East to DC just to perform at an Alliance for Peace benefit that Chic Dambach and I organized hosted by longtime friends Sally Epstein and Don Collins, Peter arrived directly from the DC airport with his suitcase - transcending jet lag and fatigue and gave a moving performance on peace and justice continuing to mix for hours with the eclectic group. Peter also sang his song “The Children are Listening” for the first time to Sally and Don at their home before we went to Capitol Hill to advocate for Operation Respect. A memorable event we all organized was at the home of Peter’s friend Ambassador Elizabeth Bagley: grand success - over capacity - with a lot of schmoozing and connecting with potential supporters and faithful ones. Senator John Kerry, Senator Harris Wofford and Elizabeth Bagley gave glowing tributes to Peter and the important work of Operation Respect. For decades, Peter volunteered and sang at Returned Peace Corps Volunteer/RPCV events. Peter and RPCVs fit like hand and glove, and he has been a beloved ally and advocate for decades performing at events organized by RPCVS, i.e. Kae and Don Dakin; Phi Lilienthal, Global Camps Africa and many more. Peter also lugged his guitar on his back throughout the Halls of Congress while participating in the RPCV’s annual Advocacy Day on Capitol Hill - ending with a song fest in the office of RPCV CA Congressman John Garamendi. For many years, Peter sang at RPCVs Congressman John and Patti Garamendis’ ranch in CA for John’s annual barbecues. Flying from NY to CA in the early morning and singing to hundreds that same afternoon was Peter’s way of life. Peter’s performance was always a highlight, and the Garamendi family is always so welcoming and generous. For World Learning/The Experiment in International Living/SIT, Peter once again happily agreed to perform for two Global Citizen Award events for Senator Patrick Leahy and also for Senator Harris Wofford in DC - both events attracted hundreds with monumental appreciation especially from Leahy and Wofford. In 2016, when Senator Harris Wofford married at the age of 90, Harris was interested in Peter singing, and Peter was delighted to be asked and flew to Nantucket for a celebration. His songs melted all hearts - especially the “Wedding Song: There is Love” composed by Noel Stookey’s for Peter’s wedding. Afterwards was a rejuvenating weekend at the ocean and sand dunes. Elizabeth Vale was our generous host. In 2019, for Harris Wofford’s memorial, the Wofford family was full of gratitude that Peter was going to sing. Peter pulled together a remarkable tribute on Zoom to 1000 attendees. In 2008, Peter agreed wholeheartedly to sing at an Obama campaign benefit. In record time, Peter recruited John Lawrence (Rep Nancy Pelosi’s Chief of Staff) and John Kerry (with whom Peter had been involved in the ‘60s anti-Vietnam movement). Sen Harris Wofford also spoke. It raised more funds than we anticipated - standing room only. Peter was the magnet with his rousing political activism songs. And then there were the back stage passes for “Peter, Paul and Mary” concerts at Wolftrap for the Performing Arts. For many years, we all truly enjoyed these concerts. Peter wanted to meet my son Otis and left extra tickets at the box office for Otis and friends. Otis loved the concert and meeting Peter backstage. In 1998, Peter met my daughter Hiliary at one of his performances in DC. With his advice, she and her friend Elizabeth Schroth created “People for Peace” at Stone Ridge school and raised funds for Albanian refugees, Later Peter sang for the receptive students and staff at a school assembly. When they received an award from Youth Service America, Peter once again came down from Manhattan to perform at the Kennedy Center’s Millennium Stage to support their volunteer efforts with a message read from Sargent Shriver. Attending were many old friends and colleagues. Peter also so generously wrote Hiliary’s college recommendations, On a phone call a few months ago, Peter asked if I would put my three year old grandson Thomas on, and Peter sang, “Puff the Magic Dragon” which Thomas continued to sing every night at bedtime - with no prompting. Thomas had been listening and singing Peter’s songs which were sung with daughter Bethany from Peter Yarrow’s Songbook, Favorite Folk Songs every morning on a CD in the car. Another loving gesture: Many years ago when my niece Kiera in Chicago attended a PP&M concert, Peter insisted on meeting her back stage. Peter is always the connector. The more the better. How could one person pack so much love and music into one lifetime? “The day will come when, after harnessing the winds, the tides and gravity, we shall harness the energies of love. And, on that day, for the second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire.” Pierre Teilhard de Chardin And Peter’s fire of love will continue to light the world ad infinitum. I love you, Peter, and your spirit will always be with me. With overflowing love, appreciation & gratitude, Geri Critchley For over 60 years I have had the great pleasure of knowing Peter Yarrow, my husband's partner. From the very beginning, in those crazy early days of PP&M, newly married and very unfamiliar with backstage etiquette, (if such a thing exists) it would have been easy for Peter to be annoyed at my presence, concerned that I would distract Noel from rehearsing. But Peter always made me feel welcome, kindness spilling out of his eyes, a broad smile on his face and arms reaching around me in a huge hug. He had a generosity of spirit that reached far beyond words. If you were a friend, and even with those who weren't close, he was always ready to jump in to help, regardless of the cost to himself. He helped both of us in countless ways, from doctor referrals to counseling words when needed and even came to the aid of one of our daughters when she was in trouble. And the list goes on and on.... I will remember Peter's kindness, his humor, his giggle, his wisdom and oh, how I will miss him! with love always Betty Stookey One word describes Peter Yarrow. And that one word is what embodies him. It exudes from him. The moment he enters the room it is felt. And it is so genuine. The moment we first met he gave me what seemed to be a 10 minute brotherly embrace. He whispered into my ear that he love me and my beautiful youth orchestra. He treated me like we had known each other for a lifetime. He sat with my young musicians, singing to them, hugging them, encouraging them, praising them for their performance. He was unaware of the pain and suffering many of those young musicians endure growing up in marginalized Tijuana, Mexico. Yet there he was treating them all with dignity and respect. He was unaware that he played a role in healing wounds in some of those young hearts. It’s that one word that describes Peter Yarrow that, when presented in its purest form, conquers all. That is why Peter and his music conquered a restless world. And of course that one word that describes Peter Yarrow is LOVE. Pure LOVE. Thank you for loving the world, Peter Yarrow. Thank you for loving Orquesta Guadalupana Baja California. We all love you! ​ - Ron Wakefield Back in the late 60's, early 70's, I was in school and it was the era of the Vietnam war. When it seemed like the government would not listen to the people and countless young people were being drafted for a war that Congress had not declared, some fantastic talented and brave people stepped up to become our heroes and lead the nation to a peaceful conclusion of that war. Peter, Paul and Mary were right there in the top of the list of American heroes who will forever go down in history for their own personal approach to making this country great! ​ - Olivia Ambert As a Millennial, I first discovered Peter, Paul and Mary when PBS aired the trio’s televised Holiday Concert in 1989. But it was when I was 12 years old in 1996 when I became enamored with PP&M’s music and message of hope, encouragement, inspiration, love, and sociopolitical conscientiousness. Peter, it was then when you became my permanent role model! Your sensitivity, articulate voice, words of wisdom, genuinely sweet nature, enthusiasm, passion, and massive musical talents gave me something and someone special to look up to in times of trouble from that point forward in my life. And whenever I listen to your music and the music of Peter, Paul and Mary, I always feel a sense of internal comfort and reassurance. Thank you, Peter, for your loving affection. Thank you for keeping an open mind and heart to everyone. Thank you for being a gift to the world. And, thank you for sharing my first name! ​ - Peter Felton Hi Chris and Bethany and Hi Peter! How do I pick just one story? I have a childhood of memories with your family as I hold Chris as one of my dearest childhood friends. It started at P.S.6 in NYC where Peter would come into our class and sing to us. He sat at the front of the room with his friendly smile, talking in different funny voices and singing songs like “Jimmy Cracked Corn and I Don’t Care” and, of course, “Puff….”. And I remember spending countless hours in the apartment (Chris cutting his hand was HIS own darn fault, Peter!”) and how loving every interaction with Peter was, and I am sure still is. And then, of course, there was Snowbird. And, though a teen at this point, I still thought how strange it was that everyone was making such a big deal about Peter…he’s Chris’ dad…that’s it. LOL. I could go on with little flashes of vignettes…P.S.6, Riverdale, Astros, sleepovers. I am forever grateful for the warmth and love to have received from the Yarrow family…Peter, Chris, Bethany (always so cool) and Mary Beth. My warmest wishes to you, Peter. Thank you for showing us - and singing to us - about how the world can and should be. XO ​ - Greg Boosin I first experienced Peter's big heart and generous spirit when he showed up as a surprise guest lecturer for my freshman Psychology class at Cornell in 1969, the morning after he'd performed in the Barton Hall gym with Noel and Mary. But the time he really showed so much kindness was when I went to the \"backstage\" area at a folk festival in Sonoma county, California to speak with him and hand him my first cassette album. He was talking to someone else, but he motioned me to come close, and he took my hand, and squeezed it repeatedly while he finished his conversation, then turned to me and offered me to kindest attention. He was interested in the Israeli peace group I told about, and he graciously accepted my cassette album, opened his guitar case and placed it there, telling me he planned to listen when he got home. I'd be nervous about speaking to this well-known and accomplished performer, and his warmth and care meant a lot to me at that time. I thought of his song, \"And if you take my hand, my son, all will be well when the day is done.\" May the kindness and comfort he offered so naturally flow forever in the hearts of all of you who've been close to Peter, even as his time with us grows short. Blessings, and peace, Will Fudeman In 1969, when I was 6 years old, my camp counselor taught us two songs, If I Had a Hammer and Puff the Magic Dragon. Those songs stuck with me. A few years later, I learned to play them on guitar while I sang them, and I bought my first Peter, Paul & Mary album. The group was a big inspiration and influence for me. I love the songs, and the harmonies made a big impression on me. More than 25 years ago, I attended a World Hunger Year benefit at Peter's apartment in Manhattan. I appreciate his work to help sustain WHY. Several years back (I believe it was 2008 in Wichita), I attended the North American Assn. for Environmental Education (NAAEE) conference at which Peter was a guest speaker and performer. It was a special experience for me and many at the conference. I got to have lunch with Peter and a small group of my fellow environmental educators during that conference. We all shared about what we had been working on. Peter told me I was \"a keeper\". Sadly, I didn't get to continue working with him, but I appreciated that he felt that way in the moment. I was still in high school when a friend taught me the song \"Sweet Survivor\", co-written by Peter along with Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann. Over the years, and especially since the 9/11 attacks 23 years ago, I have sung that song at many peace and environmental events. I am so happy to be able to share the song with both young people and audiences filled with people I know have been dedicating themselves to making positive changes in our society for decades. Bless you, your talent, and your life's work, Peter Yarrow. We may lose you soon, but the Heavenly choir awaits your sweet tones. With love to you, your lovely and talented daughter, Bethany, and your whole family. ​ - Sharon Abreu I have had the privilege of meeting Peter several times when he visited California for his book signings and concerts. I've been a lifelong fan and Peter, Paul & Mary. My fondest memory was bringing my younger son to Barnes and Noble for his signing of \"Day is Done\". It was only a few weeks after Mary had passed, and we were all missing her so much. Daniel, though, was very excited to hear the concert and enjoying the music so much that Peter invited him to the stage to sing along and turn the pages to his book! We stayed afterwards for the signing and Peter had very encouraging words for me, the mom of a sensitive child whose soul Peter really saw. It about brought me to tears. Peter gave me his email address and phone number and invited me to call him if we ever needed his encouragement. I was far too shy to take him up on his offer, but I still have them and his note carefully placed in the book he signed. Peter - your kind words and songs have kept me going through some hard times. Thank you for sharing your kindness, your gift, your songs with us. Thank you for your words and generosity you shared with my little boy. He is a grown man now, and he remembers you fondly. You and Mary and Paul have made a real difference in the world and in our lives. Just, thank you. ​ - Julie Ellingson My dearest Peter, You have always been such a loving and kind part of my life. The music that runs through our entire family is a gift that I treasure. I'm honored to have been able to share it with you on a few occasions. The two most beautiful memories that I have of times spent with you are both fairly recent. The first was at a concert you were giving. I was with my mom and with my husband, Jose. Jose had been in a pretty bad and very depressed mood all day. He almost didn't go to the concert but Mimi and I persuaded him to come with us. When you introduced the two of us to the audience, I saw his beautiful smile for the first time that day. Your beautiful spirit and inspiring music lifted him from his depression. When you invited us onto the stage to sing with you, it was a moment that I will always treasure. The other memory was on the saddest (and yet uplifting) of all occasions. It was at the memorial to my mother following her passing. I can't thank you enough for spending that day with us. The moment that we lifted up our voices together in her honor, I know she heard us. I'm sure she joined in with you, me, and with my sister Wendy as we all harmonized on Blowing In The Wind. I will never forget it. I love you very much, my dear cousin. ​ - Brian Gold Dear Peter, I don’t know how to say goodbye. I don’t want to. You have been such a loving, motivating and inspirational part of my life. You gave the best advice and moved me to action, to lead when needed, to follow when needed, and to give the world the best of me. I will carry your love to my own dying day. Some memories: The first time I met you, I was volunteering for Allard Lowenstein’s congressional campaign. You came in to sing to the volunteers. I was annoyed because we were so busy – and now we had to stop to have a sing-along. Al found it funny and introduced the cranky teenager to you. You were very sweet and I said, “I thought being a folk singer meant you were dead.” Lovely, right? It’s amazing we ended up being friends after that. I got to know you though after Al had died. Working on a memorial out of I think Muffy Huffington’s apartment. I think. That was followed by your PS 6 concert, the only one I attended as part of the audience. I went with Mike Klesh. We loved it. When you announced that this would become an annual concert, I thought I could be helpful to make the day run better – and volunteered. You allowed me the honor of working with you on what seemed a bazillion of those – until the school’s Principal assured me, and then you, that they no longer required the supplemental funding. Over time, we introduced that audience to members of the NY Choral Society, Ed McCurdy, Tom Chapin, David Buskin, Doug Katsaros, Peter Cofield, Joe D’Urso, Chris Brown, David Roth and Cantor Bruce Benson. I have already sent you photos of some of those performances – shot by Evyonne Baker. There was a formatted invitation ostensibly written by you to the parents’ body, inviting them to be sponsors at various levels and every year the names of the sponsorships were tweaked to match that year’s concert theme. I wrote the 1st draft and faxed it to you for editing. One year, after hearing you call people mufkie puffkie and other adorable names just once too often, I renamed the sponsors to something like Mufkie Puffkie Sponsor, Doophie Dumpher Sponor, etc. You swore revenge. Thank G-d you never really exacted a price! After the PS 6 run ended, I told you I would help on any project if the money was needed. You called me with Barry Nisman of On Our Way. You don’t know this ... Barry and his wife Barb have become among my and Marsha’s dearest friends. (They have just become grandparents by the way of a beautiful girl – Riley). In July 1985, I was volunteering with World Hunger Year (now WhyHunger) and it was the time of the then annual Harry Chapin Memorial Concert at The Bottom Line. The lineup of performers was supposed to be Tom and Steve Chapin, Harry’s band, and Tom Paxton. A week before the show, Paxton had to cancel his appearance. They had sold a lot of tickets because of Paxton. Allan Pepper suggested the charity replace Paxton with someone at least on his celebrity level. I called you ... and YOU SAID YES. You were always saying ‘YES” when I needed help. I joined the staff in August 1985. I was charged with producing fundraising concerts at Town Hall – with a budget of $0.00. I was telling you about the challenge of communicating that a concert was to take place with no budget. “Sweetheart, you need to place ads in the NY Times, Village Voice, and get mentions in newspaper calendars.” Of course. I knew that. But I had literally $0.00 to work with. You paid for the ads as a donation. OMG – you really saved the charity’s butt. When I asked a few performing artists to help design holiday cards to be sold by the charity, you and Noel painted beautiful art. And Mary painted the back end of a horse with its tail in defecating position. That was memorable. I remember helping Penny to study for her American Citizenship exam. I was quizzing her. When I asked her where the White House was located, you, just passing through from the kitchen to your living room, adlibbed “at the end of the march”. That derailed us all for a few minutes. For a few years I drove a Pontiac Aster – a terrible car. One year, both of us were invited to Thanksgiving at Dotty and Sonny DiCintio’s house. It was cold outside. And then there was an awful smell inside the car – as the exhaust started coming into the car. We drove with the windows open. When we got to Dotty’s, you walked in – pointed at me and informed her that I had tried to kill you. Nice! I considered making you walk back to Manhattan, but ... nah. You welcomed my friends into your loving circle. You showed such compassion when Judy Zdziera needed a brain tumor surgery. Oh, how you loved on her and made her feel so safe. When David Buskin and Robin Batteau parted ways for a few years, you made David feel wanted and welcome when he needed it the most. When it was time for me to finally leave WhyHunger, they gave me a goodbye party – and you came to sing for me. I will always treasure that sweetness. You sang “The Great Mandala”; “Bob Dylan’s Dream” and “Sweet Survivor”. Those lyrics are haunting me now. Carry on my sweet survivor, carry on my lonely friend Don't give up on the dream, and don't you let it end. Carry on my sweet survivor, Though you know that something's gone For everything that matters carry on. Peter, I promise you that all of us you leave behind, will carry on for everything and everyone that matters. It’s the very least we owe you. I love you dear Peter, my dear, dear friend. Love, Sue Leventhal Dear Peter: I was too young for the New York folk revival, and on the wrong side of the Atlantic. But I remember hearing Peter, Paul & Mary as a very young child and loving your songs, all so beautifully harmonised. Your music, and that of your great contemporaries, spoke to me even when I was too young to understand all that you were saying. I saw you live in London in 1982, on a PP&M reunion tour, the Royal Albert Hall. I was with my old friend and mentor Bob Shelton, and we all hung out a bit during sound check. The concert was wonderful. Fast forward to 2015, and the launch of FOLK CITY at the MCNY - a wonderful show and a moving performance. We spoke briefly and I told you about my idea for a festival celebrating Greenwich Village. You said we should talk and you called a couple of days later and offered lots of encouragement and advice. You said the festival must include activism. Fast forward again, to 2022, the fourth VILLAGE TRIP, and you came to the Bitter End for our celebration of Phil Ochs. And then, in September 2023, you asked if you might come and sing at LET FREEDOM RING, our evening of words and music honouring 60 years since the March on Washington and the continuing fight for justice for all. And you did come and sing, many songs, and everyone joined you on stage with Bethany at the Great Hall in Cooper Union. Cliff Pearson and I were so moved and teary-eyed. To have you with us meant so much - so too the wonderful email you sent a few days later. And then in April this year, I saw you and Noel in Boston, for the inaugural FOLK AMERICANA ROOTS HALL OF FAME AWARDS, when you were among the honorees and spoke so lovingly of Mary and your time together. And then you and Noel joined Joan Baez for 'Blowin' in the Wind'. Such an amazing conclusion to a weekend I will never forget. You have been a loving inspiration to so many, a light in the darkness, a voice in the wilderness. Because of you, the festival I crazily dreamed up is now titled THE VILLAGE TRIP - A CELEBRATION OF ARTS & ACTIVISM IN GREENWICH VILLAGE & THE EAST VILLAGE. Next year and always, we will honour your music and your memory. Your day will never been done, Peter. With love and deep respect, Liz and Cliff xxxx My dearest friend and brother, Peter, Well, I can't begin to pretend there's anything ordinary about this missive, and the raw bittersweet emotion that accompanies it. It is, in fact, the most difficult I've ever written to you. In composing this, I find myself steeped in great sorrow and anticipated grief, yet with a heart full of joy and nothing short of the gratitude and love I feel for you. Ours has always been a friendship rooted in honesty, forthrightness, and completeness - words left unsaid were never our nature. And, here we are, and here I am. Yet another opportunity to express the deep love, admiration and gratitude I have for you, and to tell you what a profound, once in a lifetime difference you’ve made in my life, in particular. I’m forever indebted to you, for the love, compassion, kindness and acceptance you graced upon us all over these past forty-three years. This message I post now will deviate somewhat from the text I sent earlier, which I hope was read aloud to you. You know me - I have to share some of my prized memories of being together in your good company... the best company, really. But, where to begin! That was January in 1980, when I attended my first concert at the Front Row Theatre here in Cleveland. When I saw that the group would be performing, yet being only a little familiar to me—I still knew I wanted to go. It was just three days after my grandfather - my mom's father - passed away. My dad and I had planned to attend together, but he opted to stay home for shiva, so a neighbor accompanied me instead. After the show, when I mentioned playing guitar, you wrote down your address and phone number, telling me to send you a cassette to critique. That critique would finally occur when you invited our whole family to a show in Toledo in April 1981. I'll never forget playing those songs for you and Noel backstage on a borrowed guitar. That’s when our friendship really began. Then life took that hard turn in November 1981, when my father passed away suddenly. You stepped in exactly when I needed it most, becoming what you later described in those college recommendation letters you’d write on my behalf, as \"a combination of uncle, mentor, teacher and friend.\" Once I asked why you'd taken such interest in a fourteen-year-old kid, and you said you saw both a need in me and yourself as a young man. That was so you - always seeing straight to the heart of things. And the memories just flood in! Remember surprising me at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in '82? Well, I do. There I was, a camper attending Kutz Camp in Warwick that summer. And during our day visit to the City, it was planned that I’d meet your assistant Kathleen, already a familiar voice to me, for lunch, in your absence. But, unbeknownst to me, you rearranged your schedule, and to my great delight and surprise— it was YOU who greeted me on the steps! Jennifer Alden was visiting at the time, and the three of us just cavorted through the museum, arm in arm. You had to show us your favorite—the armor room, no doubt! Then you sent us back to the apartment by cab, where Penny made us lunch of macaroni and cheese, watermelon, and milk. Such simple things become sacred memories. You've been there for all our simchas and sorrows, haven't you? Even when you couldn't make Lisa and Jay's wedding, you flew in for that crazy post-wedding celebration dinner with all the bells and whistles, and then after we all sat in a circle at the house, serenading the new couple for hours. During our Mom's illnesses, your visits lifted her spirits like nothing and no one else could. Even stuck in that Colorado winter storm, you tried for hours to solidify plans to attend the funeral. The fact that you'd even consider leaving your once-a-year retreat still moves me deeply. But the inclement weather halted that plan. At your suggestion, a few months later, just after Madison's birth, we threw that celebration of life party for our dear mom Marsha-just like you'd done for Vera. It was exactly what we needed, and pure you to know that. I treasure all our drives together - those magical conversations to and from airports, hotels, shows. How many times did I get us lost in those pre-GPS days? Like that infamous time I dropped you at the wrong hotel! You insisted it looked familiar, so you went in and I left. I didn’t realize my mistake until your morning call, when you alerted me as to the correct hotel. I felt horrible about that, but it still makes for a great story! \"It's OK” you said, “everyone f**** up occasionally”. That was you - always showing such humanity, such patience, even when I tried it more than a few times over the years! And then there's the music. OY, the music - don't EVEN get me started! Your sweet, angelic voice that touches the highest clouds, and brighten even the darkest days - I'll never know another like you. You've shown me how to be strong yet gentle, brave yet sensitive, thoughtful yet free-spirited. \"You always have a choice,\" you'd say, and that's guided me more than you know. The other day, I saw this touching film of Einstein in his later years, standing with friends in his yard in 1946. A young girl there - now elderly – was interviewed, and said something that made me think of you instantly. She recounted him having \"tremendously twinkling eyes, like Santa Claus,” and, at other times, “he had extremely sad eyes—a very sad look, that held all the pain in his life. But they say the eyes are the window to the soul, and he had a very deep soul”. And that's you, my friend, with those sparkling and piercing eyes of yours—eyes that have seen so much and touched so many souls. I've watched them a million times - intense and hopeful, well-worn and tired, yet always with that spark of playfulness and joy that makes you purely you. And that’s how I’ll always remember you. I was just thinking back to the catharsis of being with you in New York, at the time of Mary’s memorial concert. It was, as you know, one of those occasions to remember and acknowledge her many gifts, and to reaffirm life. I remember us eating together at (your favorite) Chinese restaurant down the street on W.67th. I’m reminded of how you were clearly going through your own grief and pain, and the permission you gave yourself to just be with it all. I anticipate allowing myself the same permission in grieving your loss, even as I’ll struggle, and fight back the tears and learn to embrace and incorporate your strong spirit into my life, however differently. I'm not always sure where I am, but I'm always grounded in the love and gratitude I feel for you. You took that wide-eyed 13-year-old kid under your generous wing and taught him to fly. These last four decades have been an UNBELIEVABLE ride and gift, my friend. I’ll always cherish beyond measure, the gift of the friend that you’ve been to me. Here I am, quoting your own lyrics back to you. Words that I, and countless others, have long taken solace and comfort in… and you should, too. Thank you for all the joy and love and compassion you've given to me, and to the world. To say I'm better for having known you would be an understatement. Your beautiful spirit will continue to guide me and live within me, forever and always, and your sweet voice will continue to soothe and resonate through me, as long as I live. Go easy, my beloved and beautiful friend. With all the love in my heart, Chuck Fink My dear Peter, You have been such an inspiration in my life, and in so many ways. I first heard you singing. Those sounds stirred my heart. They were like a calling which made me dance. One of my first choreographies as Founder and Artistic Director of Australian Dance Theatre, which celebrates its 60th anniversary next year, was called ‘This Train’ and set to seven songs of Peter, Paul and Mary. This dance work became an iconic work for the company during its first ten years from 1965 - 1975. Over this period ‘This Train’ was performed nationally here in Australia and internationally to Europe and South East Asia. It was later remounted on several occasions with different groups of dancers around the world. I shall never forget our first meeting after one of your 1965 concerts in Adelaide, South Australia. The following night the three of you came, after your show, to see us dance ‘This Train’ especially for you all. It was an unforgettable night for us. You had also inspired me with your activism and fight for compassion, justice and peace in the world. In 1967 I made another work called ‘Sundown’ which was my expression as a call for peace in Vietnam during the time of that horrendous War. This was also set to songs of Peter, Paul and Mary. I met you later several times in Australia and in New York, often with my dancers who were also immensely inspired by you. During your visits to Adelaide my husband, Jan Dalman, took some wonderful photographs of all three of you, photographs which are still prominent in my collection. In the 1980s, I think it was, during the Peter, Paul and Mary 25th Anniversary tour, you sent me tickets for your concert in the Adelaide Festival Theatre. In that huge theatre you dedicated one of your songs about Stew Ball, the racehorse, to me. Oh, how that made me blush, but it also stirred me on in my activism for peace and justice through the vehicle of my art form, the Dance. I also visited you in New York and I constantly followed your career over the years. The last time we met was in 2019 when I was in New York with Michael Keegan-Dolan’s company Teaċ Daṁsa performing in Loch na hEala/Swan Lake. You came to see the show and then took me out to dinner. That was such a beautiful reunion with a sharing of our experiences over the past years. Peter, I feel so blessed to have met you, to have known you for almost sixty years and to have danced to your beautiful voice. Thank you for being in my life, and thank you for your wonderful work and artistry that you have shared around the world. Please know that I and my personal and dance families are thinking of you and sending you all our love. Elizabeth Cameron Dalman Peter, my friend and brother. We have known each other for only about 18 years, and in that time, it seems like a lifetime. We have had wonderful times together and created some very special books. And more importantly, a bond that is so important to me. Before we met, Peter, Paul and Mary were my musical heroes, with songs that meant something to the world, and spoke to your commitment to that world and all of us who live in it. You led, for my generation, in making sure that the world knew what was right and that something must be done. But for me, the absolute highlight was meeting you for the first time as we discussed publishing Puff the Magic Dragon. We had to compete with the giant publishers. You sat on the conference table and sang Puff, and almost every person at the company managed to walk by just to hear it. That was magical. You and I saw similar visions for the book, although I knew that it would be a battle to get you to agree to some of the thoughts. But you did and we had a tremendous bestseller, and I am prouder of that book than any other I have published over 50 years. But the best part was becoming your friend and brother, a designation that taught me the power of the human spirit, and the good things you can do if you go forward, not backward, to make the world a better place. Walking down the street with you was a unique experience. If you saw somebody that was homeless, you stopped to talk and to give them money to buy some food. If you saw somebody who needed a shoulder to cry on, you were there. If we were at a restaurant, you talked to anybody that came by because they recognized you. It got to the point that I tried to make you sit with your back to the rest of the room. Not surprisingly, you managed to meet and greet anybody who came by. Our publicity tour for Puff was extraordinary. Sellout crowds everywhere, and people waiting on line to see you. And you saw every one of them. We missed a few flights because you would not leave if there was one more person to see. What an acknowledgement that was and you made sure to give them words of kindness. One of my memorable moments was your coming to the wedding of my son and singing. David didn’t think anybody would know you except the old people, but his husband told him to stop complaining and just let it happen. There were quite a number of gay couples there, and every camera was out and pictures taken. It was an unbelievable sight, and I even got a “sorry Dad, I was wrong” comment. At my 75th you sang a version of Puff that you made up to suit the occasion. It was so very special and meant a great deal to me. So much so that I forgot to thank Barbara for making the party. I’ll miss hours of talks and visits about the world and the climate of partisanship that has come to be. You have fought against that for your entire life, and that is testament to your deep commitment to the people of the world to make them aware of that and to overcome it. One can only hope somebody will pick up the torch that burned so brightly while you were here, but nobody will do it as well. Rest assured my friend, that those of us who were in your orbit will not forget and collectively we will keep the dedication alive. Rest in peace, my brother. Your work is done. Say hi to Puff for me. Charlie Nurnberg OH, WHAT A NIGHT!! For the past 15 years I’ve been writing creative Friday evening services in the hopes of putting more backsides in seats than we would have at an average Friday evening service; I’ve written about 28 of them, and we’ve done about 20 so far. We’ve prayed to three (3) Beatles’ Sabbaths, the songs of Billy Joel, Simon and Garfunkle, Broadway songs, & Motown to name a few, and every one put between 150 and 200 tushies in our pews. It’s not one or two prayers written to those songs, it’s the entire Friday evening service, from the beginning to the end of the service, but Friday evening, October 28th of this year was the most incredible of them all. It was Peter, Paul & Mary Shabbat. Peter and I met a few years earlier at the home of Linda Carroll and Bill Riley, my voice teachers, when their daughter Jennifer turned 16 (Peter is her godfather). When he walked into the room, my wife’s jaw dropped. He sat, guitar in hand, and began to sing; we all sang along. I told him that I was going to write a Friday evening service to many of the songs P, P & M made famous, and he, although a bit amused by that concept, said, Yeah, let me know when, and I’ll get there. My reply was, No, you tell me when, I’ll pick you up, and we’ll go from there. The following October, we picked him up, and we drove out to my synagogue. Incredible isn’t a strong enough adjective to describe that night with a very special guest on our pulpit: Peter Yarrow. “Do you think that they’ll, sing along with me,” he asked? He started singing “100 Miles.” “Trust me,” I said, ”they will all sing along with you,” and they did. 250+ people as one, softly, their voices rising, sang with Peter me, “If you miss the train I’m on…” and after one verse we went right into Shalom Aleichem: ​ Shalom Aleichem If you miss the train I'm on mal'achei hasharet you will know that I am gone mal'achei You can hear the whistle blow elyon a hundred miles Mimelech a hundred miles, a hundred miles malchei ham'lachim a hundred miles, a hundred miles Hakadosh You can hear the whistle blow baruch Hu a hundred miles, a hundred miles ​ We went on with the service, together chanting our prayers to various Peter, Paul & Mary tunes, and Peter, in the softest voice, spoke of his life, & the origins of the songs we used that night to enhance our Friday evening service. Instead of a sermon that evening we had a Q&A, and the first question was (of course) what is Puff The Magic Dragon about. I laughed, because when he got into our car, my wife Shelly had a question for him and before she could ask it he said: ”no, Puff… has nothing to do with drugs.” I told her that Puff… really was a song about a little boy with a toy dragon, and we both laughed. Sitting on a chair in the center of our Bimah, guitar in hand he smiled and said that when he wrote Puff… he didn’t have any of the data necessary to make it about drugs. On the other hand, he continued, had he written it a year or so later, it would have been a different story because he had lots of data by then. His answers were sweet and kind, and everything he did and said that night was with sweetness, and warmth, and there was no pretense; Peter is the genuine article, he is the real deal. If you believe that a synagogue is supposed to create a warm, spiritual community, and community is the operative word, you’re right. That night they were in that zone- they were a community- one community, 250+ voices strong, yet soft, together as one. In the 26 years that I’ve been on the pulpit at CBI, Peter, Paul & Mary Shabbat was the greatest night I’ve ever experienced. Many of the ‘old-timers’ told me that it was the greatest night since our synagogue was founded. I can’t begin to describe what was going through my body up on the pulpit as we chanted each prayer, softly, beautifully, with ONE VOICE. The air in the synagogue was electric and the spirituality lifted all of them as if they were floating above the pews. For me, a folk singer since the late 50s, sharing the pulpit with Peter Yarrow was incredible, but sharing that night with my congregation, their souls right on the pulpit with us that night was beyond mystical, beyond magical, and beyond Woodstock (and I was there). Peter wrote me a note 3 a.m. that morning- I’ll just keep the highlights: Dear Lenny, It was a joy to be with you and your congregation ... Thank you for the privilege of being with you, singing with you and meeting your open, embracing and so respectful and welcoming congregation. Love to you, Your dragon brother, Peter I can’t thank my congregation enough for allowing me the privilege of experiencing US that Friday evening. We were one, united in prayer, united in community and united in love. It was a moment in time that I pray remain with them forever; it will certainly be with me for as long as I live. Rabbi / Cantor Lenny Mandel Congregation B’nai Israel Dear Peter, We met briefly a couple of times at a Tech conference I used to attend in Orlando back in the early 2000s. I remember you being as pleasant as I imagined you would me. I was in ITS at The Citadel Military College of South Carolina back then, in my 40s, tall and thin with long dark hair. I don't expect you will remember me. There were a sea of techies for you to meet at that conference. So many people vying for your attention. It was an honor to meet you. Your music flavored my youth. I thank you for that. I enjoyed your songs so much that they gave me many hours of earworms back in the day, and maybe again today if I think about them. Sending you thoughts of comfort and healing. May this day be filled with many blessings. -Alice My mom was raised with Peter as a child, along with Peter’s sister Elena. Their mothers were sisters, and until they all followed their own paths as adults, the three were as close as if they were all siblings. My mom tills me that I meet Peter for the first time at a concert at the Woodstock Playhouse in the early 1960’s. My first memory of time with him was at a family Seder when I was around 5. He entertained me and my younger brother with children’s songs and stories, and kept us amused through what might have otherwise been a boring adult dinner. In 2014, I reconnected with Peter at a concert he performed with Noel (Paul) at Longwood Gardens in PA. From that time until a year or two ago, we stayed in periodic contact. In 2017, Peter hosted a family reunion at his home that connected my generation with cousins and stories that we’d never met or heard. It was an incredible evening of warmth, love and connection. Those are the qualities I will always associate with Peter: warmth, love and connection. I will miss knowing he’s in this world, but know that his legacy, personal and professional, will live on. ​ - Wendy Dear Peter, There are very few people in my life that have helped shaped me into the person I am now in the way that you have, and we are so sad to learn that you are not well. Just after finishing college and having grown up in the south, you took me under your wing as if I were your daughter, and you showed me the world. I remember interviewing with you on the phone, and you said to me, “If you get this job with me, it will be extremely demanding, but you will learn so much.” What an understatement. The 13 years of my life working with you were not only some of my most formative years, but I am still in awe of how much love can be spread by one person—and to literally everyone. You are a magnet, attracting not only like minded souls, but literally everyone who has had the good fortune to be near you, even if they disagree with you on many levels. I had the opportunity to watch the reactions of hundreds and thousands of people, as you spoke and sang to them, and I can’t name a single other person in my life that has had the ability to affect change in people night after night in the same capacity. Thank you, Peter, for your heart and for your persistence of not giving up the good fight, no matter how many times we are knocked down. It is a quality that I can only try to emulate, but it is one that I will hold dear to me for my entire life here on this earth. I don’t know how you instilled this in our daughter, Emilia, bc she was 4 or 5 years old that last time she saw you, but when things get difficult in her life, she somehow always thinks of you. The energy that you brought years ago is still resonating within her. You once rewrote the lyrics to “Lemon Tree” at Francesco’s and my wedding, for which we are still grateful. You changed a bitter song into something quite loving and sweet. My hope is that as you write this chapter of your life, it can be just as sweet and that all of the love and energy and peace that you have put out in the world can surround you and give you the biggest and warmest hug. We all love you so much and send love a hugs and healing energy your way, Beth, Francesco, Emilia and Nicolas Dear, Dear Peter, You have been a part of Deborah’s life since she was 10 years old, when she saw you at the Cow Palace. By the time PP&M were done singing “A Dog Named Blue,” she was absolutely enchanted by you. Little did she know that, around 40 years later, you would walk into her house and sing “Puff the Magic Dragon” to our young Emily. Ever since then, you have been a beloved member of our family. There are so many memories to share, including the many times the two of you sang together and, especially, your anthem “Don’t Laugh at Me.” A special moment that stands out is the time we brought Emily backstage to meet Mary and Noel, and she burst into tears because Mary didn’t look like the little goal “Peter, Paul, & Mommy.” With the few moments left before you went onstage, you brought Emily back into your practice room and sang “Froggy Went According” with her. When you asked me what froggies eat, Emily energetically replied “Ratatouille!” and we both laughed. Just as you have helped to heal the suffering of so many around the world who have been persecuted, hated, and marginalized, you have helped to heal our amazing daughter by bringing her into your magical world. There are no words to express how meaningful it has been to know you, how unbelievably fortunate we feel to have had you in our lives, and how grateful we are to the joy and self-confidence you have brought to Emily. Your generosity towards us, and to the world, has been unbounded. We’ve enjoyed traveling on your boat with billowed sails. We will never let your light go out, and we will make sure that it shines for years and years to come. So much love, Deborah, John, & Emily I will always remember a gathering that Peter hosted to benefit Operation Respect, the organization that he founded to combat bullying in school. Not only did he sing the song 'Don’t Laugh at Me,' which inspired him to start the organization, but he also taught us to sing it a few times, till we could all sing it together well. Peter’s work and life are a powerful lesson about the value of song and music as inspirations to all who seek social justice and a better world. Not just the written and the spoken word, but songs themselves can be powerful ways of creating solidarity and motivation. At so many of Peter’s gatherings, I think of the event at the Metropolitan Museum this year honoring him for donating a guitar, he closed with ‘If I had a Hammer’ the social justice anthem of generations, which never fails to move and inspire. ​ - Lawrence Hui It was Peter and PP&M's music in1963 that convinced me, as a 7th grader, playing the violin to switch to guitar and learn my first song, 500 Miles. I was invited to sing this at the school assembly. Fast forward to 8 years ago, my tribute group to Peter Paul and Mary, (Peter Paul and Mary Alive) went to see Peter at Pepperdine University in California to get his blessing. He not only embraced us but, called us up to the stage for the second half of his concert so sing with him. There I was with my mentor, perplexed, grateful and wondering if I should sing my part, which is Peter's part, or make up a fourth harmony....wow, what a blessing to be singing with him, and with Christopher there playing the washtub bass. Having shared our story with the audience, Christopher jokingly called me \"Dad\" because I sang the role of his father in my group. I truly love Peter Yarrow, my friend, and am so grateful for the inspiration he gave in the formation of my tribute group to his honor, as well as Mary's and Noel's. We are taking Peter's instruction to heart, \"Carry It On\". ​ - Peter Gordon To Peter, with love and gratitude for you: Thanksgiving though burdened by sorrowful past is a time of joyful communion On this day - in mountainous Sonoran Desert Bill and I hiked up our beloved trail along canyon rim - dry wash steeply below. At a sacred spot where clear echo rings out excited encouragement I sang a song of you to audience of thousands - the community of Saguaro cacti beings populating the slopes, big strong arms embracing all directions tops reaching for sky's bright blue and passing clouds. I began, fortissimo, despite old voice quavers, to sing my gratitude to you - focusing on distant slope where one familiar Saguaro stands out tall -and golden. Thank you my dear cousin - loving family member waterfall of giving generous contributor to a better and just future creator of beautiful melodies, harmonies, moving lyrics brave fighter for your own life, too - winning many battles and returning to give even more. Your courage to right wrongs stand up rise up inspired me stronger grateful for your greatness walking an effusive Love path designed by your own daring hopes and dreams so that LOVE WILL PREVAIL I love, love, love you Peter and wish for you even before you make the Great Transition that your heart rests in the peace you have always envisioned and in the harmonies that you brought to this life. Always in my heart, Cousin Karen Dearest Peter, You are my hero. You Live and Breathe Action and Impact. You are an activist that happened to express it so effectively through music. You are my idol. Such Passion, such generosity, such love! I already miss your hugs and kisses. We met through the Ranch and my choir. These photos are of the last Sonidos de Sanacion practice that you attended at Professor’s Park. Wearing my headband and Packer mittens! This same choir that found us working together. At first to find and sing to the shelter for men and children in TJ, and then helped us in so many ways with One Story At a Time. I will never forget the amazing energy and inspiration you were with Linda to create our action oriented Non-profit, then all of the humble advice you gave us along the way. We have enjoyed many a stroll and song together in Tecate. Thank you for being the inspiration that you are. Always with a sense of humor, always with witty intellect, always with a compassionate heart, always willing to DO! To ACT! To be fearless for CHANGE. Love, Love, Love, Jill As an early aspiring folk singer in the mid-60's, my main source of inspiration was Peter, Paul and Mary. In fact, the first song I ever learned to play on guitar and to sing was a P,P &M song (Polly Von). Peter's voice and guitar playing continued to inspire me throughout my life and career as a semi-professional musician. Fast forward ten years when I met Dianne in Boston. Imagine my thrill when I learned that Peter Yarrow was a cousin! After all my years of adoration, now I was related, if only through marriage. Through the years our many meetings at concerts, family gatherings and culminating with our being able to host Peter and Christopher in our house, when they played together at our local Music Hall, I was able to learn what a caring and loving soul Peter is. These qualities eclipsed his talent as a singer and musician and made me forever grateful to be part of another wonderful family. My love and thanks go out to you, Peter. Jim Sardonis Dearest Peter, cousin Dianne here. One of my favorite memories from the earlier days was when we were in Woodstock with Bob Dylan and his girl friend and my Mom. Dylan and I had a swimming race and I remember you yelling to me \"for the family, Dianne!!\" I did win sort of but I was given a head start-what fun!! I also remember you saying to us \"he is going to be famous'\" and you were so right - such a great memory! Thank you for all the great memories! I love, you Peter! Dianne Burt Sardonis Peter, my dear friend and brother. We have known each other for only about 18 years, and in that time, it seems like a lifetime. We have had wonderful times together and created some very special books. And more importantly, a bond that is so important to me. Before we met, Peter, Paul and Mary were my musical heroes, with songs that meant something to the world, and spoke to your commitment to that world and all of us who live in it. You led, for my generation, in making sure that the world knew what was right and that something must be done. But for me, the absolute highlight was meeting you for the first time as we discussed publishing Puff the Magic Dragon. We had to compete with the giant publishers. You sat on the conference table and sang Puff, and almost every person at the company managed to walk by just to hear it. That was magical. You and I saw similar visions for the book, although I knew that it would be a battle to get you to agree to some of the thoughts. But you did and we had a tremendous bestseller, and I am prouder of that book than any other I have published over 50 years. But the best part was becoming your friend and brother, a designation that taught me the power of the human spirit, and the good things you can do if you go forward, not backward, to make the world a better place. Walking down the street with you was a unique experience. If you saw somebody that was homeless, you stopped to talk and to give them money to buy some food. If you saw somebody who needed a shoulder to cry on, you were there. If we were at a restaurant, you talked to anybody that came by because they recognized you. It got to the point that I tried to make you sit with your back to the rest of the room. Not surprisingly, you managed to meet and greet anybody who came by. Our publicity tour for Puff was extraordinary. Sellout crowds everywhere, and people waiting on line to see you. And you saw every one of them. We missed a few flights because you would not leave if there was one more person to see. What an acknowledgement that was and you made sure to give them words of kindness. One of my memorable moments was your coming to the wedding of my son and singing. David didn’t think anybody would know you except the old people, but his husband told him to stop complaining and just let it happen. There were quite a number of gay couples there, and every camera was out and pictures taken. It was an unbelievable sight, and I even got a “sorry Dad, I was wrong” comment. At my 75th you sang a version of Puff that you made up to suit the occasion. It was so very special and meant a great deal to me. So much so that I forgot to thank Barbara for making the party. I’ll miss hours of talks and visits about the world and the climate of partisanship that has come to be. You have fought against that for your entire life, and that is testament to your deep commitment to the people of the world to make them aware of that and to overcome it. One can only hope somebody will pick up the torch that burned so brightly while you were here, but nobody will do it as well. Rest assured my friend, that those of us who were in your orbit will not forget and collectively we will keep the dedication alive. Barbara & Charlie Nurnberg PS to PY I don’t like to clog up this page, but I keep thinking of things I should have said previously. Firstly, your YouTube podcast thing during lockdown. I don’t think anyone else has mentioned this, but it was a daily ritual for me here in the Land of the Lockdowns…generally, it was around 11am my time. I live on the northern beaches of Sydney and we were in a Covid cluster (remember clusters?)….we took lockdowns very seriously, in retrospect perhaps too seriously, but they no doubt prevented many deaths and even more hospitalisations. For a while I was limited to a seven kilometre radius for socially distant exercising….no real hardship in such a beautiful part of the world. I’d set out with my camera, my Covid-gifted photography obsession, but make sure I was always back home for your podcast. A time of singing and talking, real time interaction with other participants, a lifeline and a window into what was happening elsewhere in the world. Through this, I could catch up with other PP&M friends, and make new ones. Andi (Akiko) Ogawa was one of the new ones. We’re almost neighbours, Tokyo being only an hour away in time zones, and we are now in at least weekly contact. Secondly, the friendships created and sustained through PP&M. One of the most deeply entrenched is with the Prestopinos. I often acted as Paul’s unofficial roadie and was deeply distressed by his oh so premature death. Sara remains a constant in my life, a source of comfort. There are others, too numerous to mention, some I’m in contact with regularly both in writing and physically when I’m in their part of the world….others I would see at concerts and we’d catch up with our news. My life has been incalculably enriched by my PP&M connections. Your acceptance and inclusion of this crazy Australian, along with that of Mary and Noel, has been as wonderful as it’s been unexpected. And tell Noel I have some more, much travelled, Berocca vitamins for him, next time I see him. They’ve been to Ohio and back, but they are still good to go. Thanks again for everything and may you be surrounded by peace and love. Carole Nash I think what I most appreciate about you, Peter, is this: You care about others. For more than five decades that caring has been expressed through ORGANIZING, through bringing people together through music, through getting GOOD THINGS DONE. With your every breath you have endeavoured to \"repair the world\", and do the Creator's work. I've been witnessing your particular brand of magic since the 1960's, and have been privileged to receive a few \"Peter hugs\" along the way. Yes, that puts me in the exclusive company of about 1,000,000 other people, but it still makes me feel very, very special. Along the way I've taken photographs of you in performance, like the one I've included here. It shows you, your daughter and granddaughter at the Woodstock Playhouse, on the occasion of DIck Kniss's memorial celebration in Woodstock over ten years ago. For me it captures three generations of Yarrows, getting together, inspiring others, and continuing to get GOOD THINGS DONE. - Mike Giovinazzo I'll never forget one of the first times I met Peter. I was home on break from college, maybe 20 years old or so. He was on one of his many frequent visits to Columbus, staying at my parents' (Rich and Carol Stoff) home, in my childhood bedroom (I stayed in the guest bedroom). I came downstairs in the morning only to hear a slow and soft \"mmmmmm.... ohhhmmmmm\" coming from the den. I crept into the den slowly, and saw Peter in full headstand with his back against a wall. \"Helloooooo Jenniiiiiiii\" he said slowly in his low, melodic voice, his eyes remaining closed. I backed up warily, tiptoeing back upstairs, to let him finish his morning devotional. I'll never forget the image, and we'll never forget you, Peter. Peter, the lives you've inspired are countless. The little bright bursts of joy that each PP&M fan feels each time they hum along to a song or lock into the perfect harmony singing along with you, last them a lifetime. Trust us, you will never be forgotten. Your light will live on for generations and generations to come. With love, Jenni Stoff Sood (with love also sent by Sumit, Maya, and Sadie Sood) Peter was an early supporter of my work - as he was of so many others. He provided a blurb for my first album back in 1988, which helped gain the ears of not a few DJs, venue owners and folk fans ever after. I would like him to know that even though I was only modestly successful as a musician, it is definitely what me into med school, and I have had a fulfilling mid-life career as a family doctor for the last 20 years. I am still grateful (and my mother would be too!). Of course, there was also that year when my toddler sons wouldn’t go to sleep without me singing “Puff” to them first - and we were certainly not alone. With great affection, Hugh As a junior at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, I for the first time saw Peter, Paul & Mary live in a concert on the night of the Vietnam War Moratorium. I had always enjoyed their music, but was blown away seeing how they engaged and motivated a large audience. Years later, after they had spent a few years pursuing solo careers and had reunited, I saw them again at Harrahs in Lake Tahoe where I was able to see several shows and, taking advantage of the bribable nature of casino properties, was able to buy my way into front row seats for a series of shows. I loved being able to sing along, and was especially gratified that they not only put up with my singing but encouraged it. After about five of those shows, Mary was nice enough to invite me backstage and I was fortunate to meet all of the members of the group and that was the start of many beautiful friendships which have lasted for decades. I always appreciated that Peter, Noel, and Mary all walked the talk - each was genuinely invested in being the best person that they could be and, notwithstanding the burdens of celebrity, did their best to maintain their humanity and their care for others. I was also greatly impressed at one factor that is rarely commented upon, which is how bright and well educated each of the members of the group was, which is, in my view, was what, combined with their awesome musical talents, enabled them to communicate so effectively. Peter, particularly, has always had such a beautiful way of cutting through the polarization of our times and delivering a message which resonates to all. I'm a lifelong conservative, and while I might disagree on issues with Peter, I have never questioned the sincerity and beauty of his feelings and compassion. I've always believed that liberals and conservatives all want the same things, peace, prosperity, and a better world - we just disagree on how to get there. Peter never failed to move me with his love and concern for others. When my daughter was critically ill, Peter took the time to put me together with medical professionals who offered their assistance - something for which I will be forever grateful. I also will forever appreciate Peter taking the time to come to my wedding and be a part of the ceremony. I just want to express my thanks and appreciation to Peter for being a part of my life and just for being who he is - a beautiful human being. The world needs more Peters. ​ - Todd Rothbard Peter and I have been friends for over 45 years, through my job as a Kerrville Folk Festival Staff Photographer, I've taken hundreds of photos of him during that time, including one he told me was his Mother's favorite image of him! I got to document Bethany and Cristopher over the years as they began to perform with him, and watched them become wonderful musicians in their own right! Once, about this time of year, a relative who was visiting brought in the mail and handed me a letter. Looking at the return address, 'Peter, Paul and Mary', he asked, \"You get personal mail from Peter Yarrow?\" I opened the envelope and read out loud, \"Dear Merri Lu, This year It's time for a new ornament on the tree...this one's for you!\" I was so touched!!! Another year, while I was photographing the Festival, my sweet husband, Rick, stayed home in British Columbia, on a job. Normally, he and Peter shared birthdays during the fest. Staff had presented Peter with a cake on stage and afterward he'd wandered all over the 60 acres visiting with people, and listening to them sing, About 1AM, he turned to me and said, \"Let's walk to the office together. I want to call Rick and wish him a Happy Birthday.\" We did and he even sang to Rick! He's one of the most thoughtful, passionate and compassionate people I've ever known. I'm certain everyone feels they are extra special to him, because he shares himself so fully and open heartedly with them, too. All blessings on your upcoming journey, Peter. I love you dearly and you're a treasure in my life! Merri Lu Park My dear, dear friend, Peter, As you – both on your own and as part to P,P,& M -- have been the sound track for social justice in America for over 60 years, so you have played that role in so much of my own life. We have protested together and marched together; we have campaigned together and, with Mary and Noel, gone to jail together (protesting apartheid); we have participated in memorial services together (from Allard Lowenstein to Mary); and we have celebrated together at important life cycle moments of joy and sadness from my wedding, where you sang so beautifully, to your 85th at which I was honored to offer a tribute. With other champions of social justice, among them President Clinton, Ted Kennedy and an array of civil, women’s and gay rights leaders, you were always a star -- and played a key role at the Religious Action Center’s (the RAC’s) 25th and, ten years later, at my own 25th at the helm of the RAC. And these kindnesses with which you have graced my life, are just one person’s memories of the vast array of ways you have been there, when you were need and have enriched the lives of so many of those who are blessed to call you “friend,” as well as too many political candidates and good causes to count -- as has been reflected in the beautiful tributes Bethany and Christopher have gathered. But, then, dear Peter, you’ve literally touched the lives of millions for the better, over all these decades. A special thanks, Peter, for your contributions to the communal life of the Reform Jewish Movement. At so many of our national Reform Jewish Movement gatherings, your songs and messages inspired and mobilized our social justice activists and leaders. You and I had fun recording our “Sing Out for Justice” album, debating the words for “Light One Candle” (and took pride that one of those conventions was one of the first places you performed it). Of course sitting through one of your sound checks was -- an intense experience. These are challenging days for you Peter, and for all who love you – and you are deeply in my thoughts , in my heart, and in my prayers for comfort and blessing. With abiding affection and boundless appreciation for all you have meant to me, my family and the cause of tikkun olam, David Saperstein and Ellen, Danny and Ari When I knocked on your door the day we met, I was soaking wet and out of breath after running most of the way to your apartment from the east side. I thought I’d left myself enough time but I underestimated how long it took to get a taxi in the rain at five o’clock. All you said was how alive I looked, were my cheeks naturally that rosy, and would I like a towel. The first of many lessons on grace that I would learn from you. We spent the next three hours talking, watching videos, and listening to music in what was by far the strangest and best job interview I have ever had. Gigi was moving on and you needed a new personal assistant, facts I only learned hours before meeting you. See, earlier that week I had a call from a headhunter who had tried briefly to help me find work when I first arrived in New York City. I’d moved there with my band, a suitcase full of art supplies, and a philosophy degree from University of California. I had no idea what to do with my life and neither did the headhunter. Fast-forward a year: I’m at my desk in a windowless office doing mind-numbing administrative work for a couple of shady ex-stockbrokers when the phone rings. It’s the headhunter. He says, “I don’t know if you’re still looking for a job but I think I have something for you. In fact you’re the ONLY person I could think of for this opportunity because it’s not like anything else. Just like you!” (It wasn’t a compliment.) He said I’d be working for a “pop icon” but that’s all he would tell me until two and a half hours before I showed up dripping all over your welcome mat. “It’s Peter Yarrow,” he proclaims on the phone. Ever heard of him?” Uh, yeah. You were only my first and arguably most important musical influence ever to that point. “Yeah, I know who he is.” “Right. See? I knew you were a good candidate for this. Now don’t act starstruck okay?” Yeah, I said again. I got it. And thank god I was 23 and full of myself because if I had to meet you for the first time today, there’s no way I’d make that promise. I hung up the phone and ran from third avenue. We mostly talked about Operation Respect and how to build a grassroots movement. I’m sure we talked about music too, Kant and Aristotle, and the sacrifices involved with being a personal assistant. It was a wonderful three hours, for both of us, I think. So you can imagine my surprise when Gigi called a few days later to say I hadn’t gotten the job, ostensibly because I was too young and busy with my music and whatnot. But in the next breath she said, “Hold on, we’re not done. I’m fighting for you. You’re just like I was when I started here, and I will make him remember.” That’s the first time anyone had ever done anything like that for me before. And soon enough I was out of my miserable east side office doing god knows what for god knows who — nothing and nobody good. And I was going to work with Gigi, Ali, Lizzie, Caroline, Mark, and you, learning how to REALLY change the world hand-in-hand with some of the best people in it. You gave me so much in those years, and so much you never knew. So I’ll tell you now: You gave me the ability to see my own superpowers and put them to use for good in the world. You showed me how to think 10 steps ahead of anything and anyone, how to lay a foundation for massive social change, and how the same heart connection you can make with one person can be made with every person across the globe. You gave me a lifetime of love, and lifelong friendships. You showed me that if you can get really, really good at something, no one can take that away from you. Not schoolyard bullies, not senators, not CEOs. You can be serious and silly. Careworn and effortless. Planned, practiced, prepared, and still full of childlike wonder. You can be all of it, all at once, and it will be magic. Even when it’s hard. Even when it’s sad. Even when it hurts so much that you don’t know if it’s a light at the end of the tunnel or an oncoming train. It will still be magic. Thank you, Peter, for the magic. ​ - Katherine Nudelman Thank you Peter, for the music and the love. We started attending PP+M concerts in the late 1960s. In the 1980s and early 90s we took our two daughters to 7 or 8 shows. Carly, the eldest, came with us to a show at the Sunrise Musical Theater in 1985; at age 6. She carried white roses to give to Mary and at the end of intermission walked to the stage. Peter invited her up. Mary picked her up and thanked her. Peter then asked her a few questions. Carly politely asked Peter if he could hurry up as she had to go to the bathroom badly. Peter said sure as he said… “ I understand that very well”. 5000 concert goers burst out laughing. Over the years we attended many shows and met Peter at FAI several times. He is always generous with his time and we have been singing his music for decades. Thank you Peter. We love you. The Engels Family Hollywood Florida Oh, Peter -- thank you! Thank you for the first concert I attended at eleven years of age, and thank you for all 77 Peter, Paul, and Mary concerts that I have attended through the years (not counting the PYNPS concerts, and your solo concerts). Presto used to say that that was a fine kind of madness... You have inspired, entertained, and given us hope, when it seems hope is gone. Yes, you have provided much of the soundtrack of my life. You have never given up on us, and perhaps your courage, your willingness to speak the truth when it is hard, and your kindness and accessibility are things that, along with your music, will live on. Your memory will always be a blessing. The Peter salads before the concerts, the amazing hour long sound checks, your attention to detail -- I will always treasure these memories. The party at your apartment after the Holiday Concert at Carnegie Hall (with John Kerry in attendance), and the patience backstage after the shows when you were exhausted, but you stayed to meet and greet the people whose lives you inspired. It's hard for me to pick one image to include, but I chose this one of you and Presto at Ocean Grove. The love that goes out to you from all your \"little dragons\" is immeasurable. You are loved, and will be loved, always. ​ - Rebecca Russell McFee Dearest Peter, You have been part of my family since the reunion tour in 1978(?). You graciously met with concert goers after the show, and that started a lifelong friendship. My parents brought Philip and I to see PP&M the following year when you toured in Detroit and I was awestruck. You have been there for most of the pivotal events in my life, always with a shoulder to lean on, and sage advice to a young, shy, woman trying to figure out my place in the world. We have lost touch over the years, one of my biggest regrets, but please know that you remain one of the biggest influences in my life, and not a day goes by that I don’t think of you. Your guidance and passion for outing injustice has taken me from Nicaragua in 1991, to participation in countless medical missions in the Caribbean and Central America, translating your message of service to my area of talent (nursing and anesthesia). My life has lead me from New York to finding my passion providing anesthesia to the underserved area of northern New Mexico. Your kind support has lead that shy girl to become a leader that is not afraid to speak the truth, now able to stand up for what is right in my little slice of the world (my hospital and the Taos community). You once told me that I reminded you of yourself (a VERY high compliment!), and I have very much taken that to heart, trying to emulate your example in my own world. My biggest regret in losing touch with you is that my son (who is now 10!) hasn’t had the opportunity to meet you. He hears stories about you and PP&M all the time though and has listened to your music all along. Much love to you Peter. I wish you a journey of peace and love. I’m thinking of you constantly, please feel my warm hug coming from the mountains of northern New Mexico. Thank you for all of it. I would not be the brave, outspoken fighter for justice without all you have taught me. Much love, Kim Brandt (and son Declan) Dear Peter, You've always been a special presence in my life. I first saw Peter, Paul, and Mary perform when I was a young kid interested in music, and your dedication and musicality was inspirational. I've always found you to be a warm and giving person. When I needed someone to do a benefit for my son's school, your first response was: \"I'll be there.\" And at that time, playing a benefit for a bunch of kids with attention deficit disorders was no simple task - but you handled it masterfully. Not only that, but you made the whole process seamless and beautiful. There's a saying that I've always loved, which is, \"Those who give quickly give twice.\" You've been giving your entire life, quickly and three times over. Your music and your commitment to helping others through music has been a shining star in a world where often we can often only see the dark of night. Much love, Jeff I will never forget watching you sing one New Years Eve at the Golden Cliff Restaurant and Lodge in Snowbird, Utah, in the early 80’s. I was working at the front desk of lodge, and got to sneak away and catch part of your show while peaking over the balcony from the lounge above. What made it so special was that the love of my life, eventually my husband of almost 40 years now, had driven from Wisconsin up into the Utah mountains to spend New Years Eve with me. Watching you, listening to you sing the songs that filled our souls with so many emotions and truths for as long as we could remember, made that evening magical, and set our forever love on its path. Thank you for always, way before that fateful New Years Eve, for always guiding us and sharing the way to love and live through your music, for filling our hearts and souls with goodness and light, through good times and bad. As life goes on, it turns out that one of our greatest gifts is that our sons are musicians now, and hopefully passing on a little bit of your light through their songs as they reach people through their music. Thank you for everything. Thank you for making a difference. Wishing you love and peace, we are humbled in your presence. With gratitude, Deb and Tom Lynch Dear Peter, We are writing to say thank you for all the wonderful times we have shared together as family. Your music has brought us together by your talent, artistry and magical lyrics. Your love and friendship have kept us together over the years and continues to bind us even though we are apart. For this we are forever grateful, and that you have invited us to be a part of your life. Your guidance and vision have given us so much and the memories of our times together will last and guide us with a hopeful loving path forward. We hope you find peace and love with family and friends in this difficult time. With love, Tom, Gail, Brian and Melissa Enright We met Peter's son Christopher at a festival in Happy Valley Oregon around 2010, and started jamming. Christopher played a bucket bass. Because my husband Miri and I have a photography company, a year or two later, Christopher asked us to meet him and his father Peter at Mount Tabor, in Portland. What an honor! The session was fun, but it was a very cold day, so we didn't linger longer than we needed to. We thought we had gotten enough good shots, but at the last minute, Miri said, \"hey hold that bucket up over your heads\" and then the best shot of the day happened. A couple years later, we did a couple of more formal sessions with Peter, and once again, he was completely playful yet professional, helping with the art direction for more serious shots by saying things like \"Don't laugh -- think of sick puppies!\" Peter's energy and absolutely hilarious sense of humor always made for amazing images. Thank you Peter for allowing us to see your brilliant mind at work! We will always remember those times with great fondness -- and btw, that image of Peter and Christopher with the bucket has been hanging on our wall prominently for the last 12 years. Sending hugs to Peter and everyone who cares about him!!! ​ - Darka & Miri Stebivka I met Peter during a very difficult period in my life. My health was extremely frail and I had been encouraged to reach out to meet Peter, Paul and Mary, as their music had been a lifeline for me during many years of health challenges. I was gifted back stage passes in 2004 and Peter embraced me with a huge hug and so much love and support. He became a huge support, a fierce advocate and most importantly a dear friend. Shortly after we met, he helped me fight for a diagnosis of what was causing my extreme headaches along with many other challenging symptoms. We found out I had chiari malformation, neck and spinal cord complications. Peter got on a plane to be by my side in the ICU to help me get thru many very painful and complex operations. My conditions do not have a cure, the surgeries only help relieve some of the many difficult symptoms. When I have had severe pain flares that I’ve needed to be hospitalized for, he has called to sing to and support me many, many times. Since we first connected in 2004 my life has taken many twists and turns and led me to sing to patients who are in hospice care. He has been a huge supporter of me doing this sacred work. Peter’s love, support, music and advocacy have literally kept me alive while living with incurable health challenges. I’ve had the immense joy and honor of singing with Peter at some of the Don’t Laugh At Me presentations and at Kerrville, those experiences will stay with me until my final days. Peter, thank you for your friendship, for the beautiful music, for believing that I could stabilize when everyone else had given up over and over again. Thank you for the pony song, which helps me find a way to hold on in the darkest hours. Please know how much I love you and that I am sending you so much love. I treasure our friendship more than I have words for you. I love you, dear one. ​ - Gillian Trumbull Dearest Peter, As I ponder the words to send to you, many sweet memories come forward. You, along with Mary and Noel, have brought inspiration and joy into most of my life. Among my very best birthdays was my 16th on January 28, 1966, when a sweet young man treated me to a PP&M concert at the Loyola Field House in New Orleans and 16 long stemmed red roses! After a joyous concert from my favorite group, we got to meet and chat with each of you afterwards. It was truly an evening to remember! Over the years, I have enjoyed many evenings at your concerts in person or on TV, and have spent many hours listening or singing along to your records, tapes, CDs and DVDs. You have been with me as I sang with my friends, and learned of peace, injustice, and love from you. I sang your songs to, and with, my three children and my students; oh, how they all love Puff, and were delighted that I had met Puff’s Daddy! You welcomed me into your home on September 21, 2010, with a kiss on each cheek when I attended your fundraiser for Why Hunger with my friend Sue Leventhal. Your warmth that evening was palpable as you gave of yourself, as you always have, giving your time, talents, and even your home, to raise up your brothers and sisters in need. You generously gave me your Operation Respect Don’t Laugh at Me curriculum, not once but twice, and to my husband Larkin, also, for his classes. I left my first set with my successor in California, then you provided it for me again when I resumed teaching in Alaska. Peter, you touched the minds and hearts of all of our students, and through them, their families! What a magnificent program!! For several years, I took my 4th grade students in Willow, Alaska on a field trip on the only remaining flag stop train in the United States. Yes, we flagged her! As we studied and prepared for our trip, I taught them train songs to sing on the trip, including your This Train, Freight Train, and Morning Train. Many of our chaperones joined in! In February, 2018 you sent me a lovely personal note in response to one of our donations to Operation Respect, wishing me well after my heart surgery. How thoughtful and kind of you to take the time for me. You are a dear man and good friend. During the Covid lockdown, you came into our hearts and home via computer, calming our concerns and bringing us joy and comfort with your stories and songs. Peter, these are just a few of the many, many ways that you have been a part of my life, and of my family’s, friends’ and students’ lives. You are a model for how to live well, work for our beliefs, and above all to love. As a symbol of our love, admiration, and respect, we are again sending a donation in your honor to Operation Respect today. With much love, Suzanne Bounds Willow Alaska I was privileged to have booked Peter as the headliner for our 2013 Annual Savannah Folk Music Festival when I was President for the Savannah Folk Music Society / Festival Coordinator from 2011 to 2016. Peter and his son Christopher graced the stage and played 2 wonderful sets. In 1999 we were also able to bring Noel (Paul) as headliner for the Festival too. I grew up listening to Peter Paul and Mary from the early 60's in Bombay, India and still continue listening to / singing and playing their songs till this day after moving to Savannah since 1992. I too love the song \" Don't Laugh At Me\" and frequently perform it myself. Peter's contribution to the Music World as well as his passion to promote \"Anti- Bullying\" of children in particular is very noble and something that I support whole heartedly. Peter and I share one thing in common ..............both of us had our guitars stolen at different times. My precious 12 String Ovation - Glen Campbell model was taken from the Green Room area of Grayson Stadium after the 2013 Savannah Folk Music Festival, where I had brought the guitar so that Peter could sign it for me. While chatting on the way to drop Peter at the Savannah Airport, Peter shared his stolen guitar story with me..........he got his back after 10 years though!! Fortunately I was able to recover my guitar and when we visited New York for a friend's 60th Birthday, I was able to take my guitar to Peter's house, kind courtesy of David Tamulevich's assistance and finally did get him to sign it for me. Thank You Peter: for sharing your talent, vision and music with all of us worldwide as Peter Paul and Mary as well as your solo work and Project Respect ​ - Christopher Desa Peter, you changed my life. It goes back to a couple of specific times...raiding my older sister's record collection for all her PPM records when we were young kids in Chicago, to Kerrville New Folk in 1986 when you sat in the front row as I sang \"Manuel Garcia\" for one of the first times...and you came up to me afterwards and told me how you mom was struggling with cancer right then. That's how we became friends, and I had to pinch myself more than a few times over the years for our intersections...your 50th birthday celebration at Kerrville (that's WAY 'in the rear view mirror for me now at 71) and the continued celebrations in New York City which included a boat ride with friends and family on the Hudson River. You gave my dad Irving the biggest and longest hug he ever received in his life when I brought him backstage after your outdoor concert in Miami years later. What I want to say to you is that you've inspired me for a long time, and to know you even the littlest bit over the years has been very meaningful to me, it has encouraged me to be the best singer and songwriter I can be, and I will be forever grateful knowing we shared molecules at the same time on this spinning blue orb. Godspeed, and may we always be connected. ​ - David Roth My dearest, dearest peter. I want you to know that from the first time I met you as a little girl you meant the world to me. First you meant the world to me as an artist and someone I deeply admired, respected, and was following a path in the arts that I knew I too wanted to follow. I was in awe of you and everything you stood for. Then you meant the world to me as my dad’s friend who saw me and understood me. I felt seen by you in a way I rarely had as a young adult finding my way. You meant the world to me as a fierce social justice advocate and colleague. Serving on the board of operation respect was such an honor and privilege. The heart you wear on your sleeve for all who have been wronged and all the injustices in the world is a thing of sheer beauty. But most of all, you mean the world to me as a friend. I’ve always felt like a piece of my father has lived on in you and being in your presence is like being enveloped in the warmest hug. A hug I wish I could stay in forever. You will always live on in my heart and in the hearts of my children who already love listening to your music. You, peter, are the dragon who will live forever in all of us. With all my love and admiration forever and always ​ - Jaimie Mayer Dear Peter, Far too often we are selfish with our words and hold back, I wish I would have said these things to you years ago or at least the last time we saw each other. You, my friend, are an extraordinary human being. You have given so much of yourself to make the world, especially the musical world, a far better place...a world of hope and happiness. Your kindness and generosity are are apparent in every step you take and every note you sing. You and I do have something very special in common. Of course under completely different circumstances, we both became part of the incredible and loving McCarthy family. And that is how we met! Since that time, (1969 I believe) I have held you in awe and with great respect.My children and their children sing your songs and hum your tunes and even tear in empathy with Puff. Your music and its message will live on for generations and across the world. Thank you for everything. Maureen O'Hearn, Julie's college roommate. I was lucky to have inherited \"Uncle Peter\" through my husband, \"Matty\" (he & Peter were longtime friends before we married). Peter often stayed at our home in Miami Beach when performing in South Florida. And we spent time with him in Telluride one winter. Our sons, now 35 and 31, grew up listening to Peter's music, literally. I was very pregnant with Ryan, sitting in the front row at a PP&M concert - when the little guy in my belly started \"swaying with the music\" - awesome experience! One year, I convinced Peter to headline the Greater Miami Jewish Federation's annual Women's Day Luncheon, which I co-chaired. His \"Light One Candle\" earned a standing ovation! I have many fond memories of times spent with Peter. His kindness, generosity and dedication to manifesting \"good\" stand out in my mind. Sending hugs and love to Peter and family. ​ - Debra Leibowitz Hi Peter, The Light Ahead, the first song I ever wrote in 1998, reminds me of your strong determination towards hope, to bring out the light in everyone and to bring people together for good causes to create a better world. Thanks to my friend Joel Landy for producing the after the Elections program at PVC and for helping me to get my part in it to you. Am attaching the link, which should lead directly to it (let me know if it works) https://vimeo.com/1035826371?share=copy In light and love, Bracha I met Peter under the most unusual of circumstances. We have stayed in touch ever since and always get a laugh out of the experience. It was a Sunday afternoon back in the late 1990s. There was a fierce blizzard blanketing the Northeast and Peter and I happened to be across the isle on the same slow, snow delayed train from Boston to Penn Station, New York. At 11pm and about 5 miles from Penn Station, our train came to a halt. The snowbanks grew and the wind whistled. There was no electricity, no light and no heat. As you can imagine him doing, Peter reached up to the overhead and retrieved his guitar and began to play and sing. From 11 PM to about 2:30AM in the morning everyone in the entire train found their way to our car for what was and incredible, emotional and spontaneous sing-along with Peter. Every soul lucky enough to be on that train will remember and cherish the experience forever! To my great embarrassment, I didn’t know the identity of this talented musician. As the train lights flickered on, the heat came back and the train began moving again, Peter restored his guitar to its case and put it back overhead. “Wow” I said. “I don’t know what you do for a living but you ought to get yourself into music”. Peter smiled and everyone around us looked at me as the dumbest person on earth! Since that evening I have always tried to attend Peter’s many concerts in the Boston area and he would never fail to invite me backstage when the concert was over. One time, at the Golden Rooster in Scituate MA he told the train story and invited me to join him onstage to sing Puff the Magic Dragon! On my 50th birthday back in 2001, Peter appeared at my firm’s Boston Office and gave a surprise concert to our 2000 employees. He composed a funny song for the occasion about the train adventure. One of my favorite keepsakes is a Peter Paul and Mary legacy picture book. It contains the inscription “To my Train Buddy Digger, Thank you for your career advice. Peter”. Digger Donahue Dear Pater…I was the 10 year old in 1963 listening to my sister PP&M albums ..asking for a guitar that Christmas.. and determining my fate and faith as a folk singer in those moments. Never in my dreams did I think I would call you a friend! And here we are .. as I reach my 64th year as a folk performer.. ! Singing with you obviously a dream come true.. getting to know Christopher( I love you! ) and sharing stage moments and harmonies will fill me forever.. never can one person be so terrified as I onstage … when Peter says ‘Libby just sing .. “ if you miss the train I’m on” …. I’ll walk that tightrope again with you Pater…anytime ..everywhere.. so generous ..with deep love know that I am throwing you a kiss…. ​ ​ove to the family Libby Glover Mustard’s Retreat My dear brother, as you always called me: You are such special homosapien, some would say, “such a mench”, you have been such an influence in my life, and the life of my family. There is the family you inherit, and the family we choose; you, the Yarrows are the family we choose. I feel so close and connected to you, since our paths crossed during unique circumstances, we meet at a very sensitive period of your life, when you found out that your beloved daughter head a “brain” problem, it is such shocking, shaking news that confronts you; all types of questions, fears, run through your mind. I will never forget the intense conversation we had as we left the hospital. We talked about life, how we are, whom and how we love, how we care, being scared on behalf of your loved one, and it went on and on. We found out how many similarities we have, how compulsive, persistent, curious, intuitive we both are. You and Marybeth impressed me with how much you wanted to know, to understand what the problem was, and you did! In all my years as a doctor dealing with very complex, rare, life threating medical problems, I’ve interacted with all type of people of all type of backgrounds, but when you find a family like yours, so involved, wanting to learn, understand, it creates a special bond between the physician and the patient.And in this case, with this family, with this father, a homo sapiens like you…... it bonds your life for eternity. Thanks for so much you have done for all of us in this complex conflicting world, if we would have more people like you in this world, there would be an end to all the hate, violence and inequality, and it would be a better world. I love YOU BROTHER for eternity……. ​ - Alejandro Berenstein There are so many things I could say about Peter’s impact, passion or generosity over the years. But the things that comes to mind is his thoughtfulness just after my liver transplant. We hadn’t spoken or seen each other for at least a year. I was recuperating at home, mired in worries about returning to work and life, unsure of my ability to come back. One day the mail came including package from Washington state. The box was plainly wrapped with very little identification other than my address and Yarrow on the return. Upon opening I found a beautiful vase, obviously one of a kind from an artist with a note: “ From your buddy Puff!” The love out of the blue was just what I needed in that moment. A shot of love and remembrance in a time of doubt. Peter came through in a personal and heartfelt way caressing me as a friend. I’ll always remember! . Reggie Harris I had the honor of singing with Peter as part of New York Choral Society for one of the holiday concerts. Singing with him, Mary, and Noel was a childhood dream come true. I grew up with “Puff” and so many other songs. After singing with them, I downloaded their chronology and listened to it countless times. I now live in Arizona and had the privilege of seeing Peter and Noel at the Mesa Arts Center a couple of years ago. It was such a treat to sing along with them again to song like Weave Me The Sunshine and many others. My life is so much richer and fuller for having Peter and his music as a part of it. As you take your place on the Great Mandella, know that your are free now, you can heal now, you can love now, and now you can be sure the world will go on with you as eternally present in the consciousness and hearts of so many you have touched. With love and comfort, Jason Seth Beckerman, Ed.D. Peter you are such an important part of our family. When our mom, Harriet, passed away 30+ years ago, she was beyond touched by your incredible generosity, empathy and the extreme kindness you showed in composing \"Harriet's Song\",which meant the world to Harriet and to our family. We cannot thank you enough for your friendship and the selfless love you have shown our family. We love you, dear Peter, and will forever be eternally grateful to you. You are in our hearts and prayers. With much love always, Brent Nestor and the entire Nestor family Dear Peter, I can’t thank you enough for the hope, strength, and vision you and your music gave me and my whole generation back in the 60s. But, as great as that was, I REALLY loved your work with Don’t Laugh At Me. (By then I’d been teaching in public schools since 1970.) Not only did I have you open the school year at my school district in IL, but I had the privilege of co-presenting with you at education conferences and I know that DLAM touched not only thousands of students, but their teachers too. I love this picture of us. You’re wearing the shirt I gave you the night before you spoke at National Louis University graduation and received your honorary doctorate. Your life has inspired, challenged, and graced so many of us. You live on in our hearts and our lives. Well done Peter, well done. Sending you love and peace. Joan Maute, Ed.D. Dear, Sweet Peter, You have been in my constant thoughts these past few days… with a lump in my throat and heart breaking at the thought of you leaving this Earth plane. I have been reading some of the lovely memories and tributes sent to you by so many of us that you have so genuinely touched in your long, well-lived life. Your seemingly boundless energy and unwavering, deep love that you have shared with each of us is nothing short of a precious legacy! Even through my teary eyes, this makes me smile I promise to you that I will: - Go to jail for justice - Ring the bell of freedom - …and Carry On You have been a true force of nature packaged in a gentle, loving soul. Thank you for all of the wonderful songs that I will continue to sing and all of the fun we had driving around the Texas Hill Country! With my deepest love and gratitude… Barbara Burton Kerrville This is Peter Wong from Hong Kong ! Thanks so much for your coming to support Invitation Education through hosting concerts and sharing in our conference! Your singing and sharing had already touched many lives ! The Project Respect started because of your support in Hong Kong has provided tremendous impacts to hundreds of schools and helped thousands of children breaking through the trauma of bullying and know how to support each others!! The song ‘ Puff the magic dragon ‘ is in our school children’s song book and always sings by students of all ages as well as teachers !!We are so grateful for your friendship and generosity of sharing your beautiful life ! Your contribution to the world will be remembered eternally ! I send my love and want to say a big Thankyou on behalf of children and schools as well as families in Hong Kong ! We all send our very best and love to you! Peter , lots of love from your brother in Hong Kong , China ! - Peter Wong Peter. You are larger than life. Superman. I have a cousin who was part of Peter, Paul and Mary. Puff. But you were also a young super boy in the stories I grew up on from my mom, Mimi. I always heard stories about you, my mom and your big sister running around and playing like siblings. There was always a story about the young you. There are so many pictures of you before you were Puffs dad. That is who you are when i first think about you. First you were super boy. Then, I also remember listening to Peter,Paul and Mary records at home, then singing them endlessly in the car. My sister Dana and I giggled when we heard Boa Constrictor and we loved Going to the Zoo, no matter where we were going. When we went to concerts those were two songs we always waited for. You are two different people to me - Both Superman and super boy. I “met” you through stories of your childhood, then I found out you were pretty damned famous. You were the music of my childhood. You became the stories and music of my kids’ childhood. Peter, you knew then, and will always know, how to capture hearts. Years could go by without seeing you, but when we did, we could always count on a big big hug and then you listening to us like there was nobody else in the room. Then off to your full time job. Your hugs are something not soon forgotten. You are someone not soon forgotten. More recently I saw another side I had never seen. At some point my mom ended up with several old pictures you had painted. She kept them for decades. I gave them to you and you told me about how much you thought you would be an artist. Perhaps inconsequential and a small detail in the broader arc of your life, but I think it was introspective, interesting. Not a side i had ever personally known. You always were , and always will be an artist. Music became your canvas, thankfully. It turns out your music was way better than your 4th grade self portrait. My mom passed a few years ago but you are still her little brother. You will play with her again someday. You will both sing together someday. I think you are that inner child I heard stories about. You are a son, you are a father, you are an uncle you are a cousin. You helped change the world me and my kids live in. You are the music I grew up to, you are the music my kids sing. You are part of the family tree we put on post-it’s on your kitchen cabinets. Your family loves you so much. Thank you for being part of the lives of three generations of family. I love you for every part of you. You are also pretty damned good at leaving an impression. Hugs from me back to you. ​ - Karen James “My brother” - how I loved those two words you said when we would meet, your gentle eyes carrying that magic gleam the sages know well, a balance of youthful wonderment filtered in matured wisdom, a charismatic combo possessed by the few in this world that live this life fully. Most of us fall woefully short. Thank you for the generous windows into how it can be done. There is one night and morn in Mississippi I shall never forget … We are in Philadelphia - no not that one - but the small one much farther south. It is not 1964 but just a few years ago. Ever the genuine troubadour, you had just brought the sleepy town of Meridian to its feet with your two-hour, one-man command of song and story. I convince you to meet a philanthropist who sits on the arts board, a fan of yours and one of the state’s most wealthy, who could help support the Operation Respect mission (which he would soon do). He and his wife invite us to their elegant home. As the evening crosses midnight you two men are deep in discussion while I take a stroll in the dark into town where I locate the old police station, an historic marker indicating this was where the three Civil Rights workers, Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney, were held under arrest before their savage murders, an event that shook the nation and ushered in a seismic shift in American reckoning. When I return, you two men of similar age, but raised on completely opposite sides of the American fence, are deep in examination, recollection and reflection on the Mississippi and country you knew over a half-century ago. If a camera had been rolling it would have made for a sensational PBS special all its own. As the man’s wife and I stand in the wings we listen as you two open up to each other. It is confessional and revealing, redeeming and healing. At one moment the elder Mississippian admits, “Peter, I grew up here. I came into my own around that event. I knew some of the ones behind those killings.” You lock your solemn and compassionate eyes on him and reply, “I played at some of their funerals.” But the healing has only begun. The next morning we are called to join a Southern brunch feast the likes I had never seen before. It is a scene out of The Help, a half-dozen or so African-American housekeepers and cooks serving twenty guests with a spread fit for royalty. The attendees are in their Southern Sunday’s best, you are in jeans and tennis shoes as you retreat to the living room to harness the peace weapon of choice, your guitar … and the spiritual makeover commences. As you calmly and diplomatically break the morn’s formality we take positions on seats and the floor. To the temple of folk music we are welcomed. Then, with the help at the rear, swaying to your sweet songs and sermons, you shatter archaic protocol, calling the help to the front who, after an awkward second of hesitation, accept your kind gesture as proper permission, for it is. They sit at your feet as you declare, “I have been at this too long to see any of us divided between the living room and the kitchen.” Then you lead us in chorus with “ We Shall Overcome.” Yes, millions were moved by the moment on the Washington Mall with Martin Luther King, Jr. featuring PPM. However, a few of us were fortunate to see its meaning and purpose in real time some five decades later - one unforgettable moment in Philadelphia, Mississippi. My brother, thank you for revealing the true power of movements. They may be remembered in monumental moments, but they are shaped in fundamental kindness. When I was a little girl, my father would sing \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" when tucking me into bed. Then sometimes I would go around singing the song at school the next day. In high school I rediscovered Peter, Paul & Mary with \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" and since then I haven't stopped listening to Peter, Paul & Mary. As a history major, I of course took the opportunity to take a class on protest songs. And during introductions (on Zoom because the first day of class was a virtual snow day), I said that the reason I was taking this class was because I like Peter, Paul & Mary. In the background I had some of the albums from Peter, Paul & Mary on the wall, hoping my teacher would notice. I even had my teacher play Peter, Paul & Mary's version of \"The Times They are A Changin'.\" I also did a small project on the song \"The Great Mandella.\" Now I have many Peter, Paul and Mary albums on vinyl, and I always look for albums by Peter, Paul & Mary albums whenever I go to a used record store. I also keep a Peter, Paul & Mary CD in one of the 5 spots in my CD player in the car. In 2022 and 2023, Peter, Paul and Mary were the artist I listened to the most on Spotify, with a total of 43,611 minutes listened to Peter, Paul & Mary between the two years. Even decades later their music is still relatable and is still powerful. \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" will always be apart of my childhood, and has a special place in my heart being an adult now. Thank you for voice and thank you for your music. You weren't afraid to speak your mind and to stand up for what you thought was right. ​ - Emily Waggoner I first met Peter in 1981, the second year I was in The New York Choral Society, whose music director was Robert De Cormier, who was also the music director for PP&M. Starting that year, and continuing for over two decades, every other year PP&M and the chorus presented a Christmas Holiday Concert at Carnegie Hall. Working with this trio -- who performed with us for gratis -- was an unforgettable, magical experience each and every time. One year we did a week on Broadway with them performing this concert, and in 1988 we recorded the concert at Lehman College, which went on to become a PBS holiday staple, and can still be seen on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKwYE8DX0JY. Over the years Peter also used singers from our group to perform at schools and on recordings for special projects. I also had the privilege of dating Peter for a brief time, which I remember with fondness. Some years after that, during a rehearsal break with the chorus, he had time for a quick hug and I showed him my wedding ring. His eyes lit up and he asked \"are you happy\" and my reply \"So very much\" seemed to fill him with joy on my behalf and he gave me another hug. I admired him deeply for his commitment to the issues he believed in; he was an artist that never paid lip service to a cause but went all in. It was one of the reasons our chorus members never hesitated to step forward whenever he requested singers. We love him. ​ - Karen Snow From those magical days at Café Wha in the Village when we became instant friends to the years of career building, no matter the miles and events between us, we remained brothers. Our love of the music we sang and the joy in sharing it has kept you in the warm part of my spirit. I remember teaching you those Hebrew songs so you could join that Israeli music group and make a few bucks when you first hit the Village scene. Then, more than fifty years later, we sang one of those songs on stage in Phoenix together. You remembered every word and chord, and the years between us melted away. I remember the day in 1961 when you offered your precious song “Puff…” to me and my partner Paul so we could sing it on stage long before you recorded it. But mostly, the long night-after-night times in Greenwich Village when we were so young. We sang and played our music and watched the world come alive around us. We've lived blessed lives my brother... ​ - Art Podell On behalf of my sister Karen’s & my PARENTS: Little Cousin Peter- You were a great kid. We always loved babysitting you. Then to have a continuous stream of love and excitement throughout our lives as we got to bring our daughters to all your concerts within a drivable radius and meet with you backstage or go out to dinner! So inspired by and proud of you! And it all came full circle for us when you so generously came and got everybody singing at my (Bob’s) 100th Birthday party. We love you forever, and we hope we’ll get to meet you here in the ever after and sit on a heavenly cloud together to have Chinese food and some delectable desserts. Love from Bob and Lillian Word has gotten to us here in the San Juans that you are about to ‘walk on’ into the spangled Cosmos. Peter you are unique and extraordinary and you are the person in my life who most exemplifies the huge and sacred practice of tikkun olam! You have spent a life giving and fixing and loving and singing. And I don’t know about rest in peace. Can’t imagine you spending eternity resting. Maybe pause for a blink or two, but I think if there are things in that realm that need fixing you will be doing it. And personally speaking, I prefer your guitar to any harp. Vast thank you for your many blessings old friend. And especially thank you for the songs. If you get to heaven before I do please tell my friends that I’m a coming too. From Mount Wilson and Wilson Peak, from Sneffels and Ajax, the winds of love and sacred transformation are blowing from your mountains, with love, Pam and John and the Lifton-Zolines I am 73... I won a guitar at a carnival when I was 9. I learned to play by playing along with the first Peter Paul and Mary album.. First song I learned was Where Have All the Flowers Gone, and soon learned all of them. I remember listening to that album many many times until I knew all the words, all the notes, and eventually learned how to harmonize. I cannot tell you; there juat aren't any words big enough to describe the impact that your first album had on me. It changed how I looked at the world and forever changed the direction of my life. I am deeply thankful for your music. We have a mutual friend, Joanie, and we all had dinner together after one of your shows and it was a huge thrill to meet you and break bread with you. I just want to say how much you are loved, and thank you for the beautiful incredible influence you had on our generation... Michael Dearest Peter, I love you with my heart and soul! You have had a profound effect on me. Sharing so many deep, personal and political moments together over many years makes It difficult to express all that you mean to me. A few words: Best buddy, confidant , plus one, soul mate, political comrade, brother in arms, teacher, supporter, partner, companion and so many deep dimensions of the word “ friend”. The efforts and events we collaborated on are some I am proudest of. Our shared struggles: You introduced me to Caesar Chavez and together we did an event with him in DC. Together, along with other celebrities that you recruited, we travelled to Vista sites around the country culminating in a Kennedy Center event that put light on Vista’s value as the dark winds of Reagan seemed likely. Writing the score for the Vista Anniversary film and giving it emotional depth with your song “ Sweet Survivor “ Creating events at over 50 tour dates, to raise needed funds for progressive organizations and political candidates. Taking my input and sharing credit with me on “ No Easy Walk To Freedom” a song about events in South Africa. Along with Noel and Mary, getting arrested at the South African embassy as we protested Apartheid. Celebrating with song and speech, a star studded event at the Kennedy Center celebrating the work of the Free South Africa Movement. Traveling together throughout El Salvador and Nicaragua to witness the despair and upheaval being suffered by the people and calling out the damaging role played by U.S foreign policy. Making the film” Heartstrings” to take what we experienced to a wider public on PBS. Teaching me over so many years and issues that “ Music Speaks Louder Than Words”, an understanding that became such an important tool in my work for social change. While we worked so hard on these struggles, of equal importance are the many personal moments and memories we shared. From the very beginning you opened your home, family and dear friends to me and I did the same. We celebrated the wonder of several weddings together. Smith and Elizabeth’s, your Bethany’s, my Laurie’s and then your singing at my wedding to Earl. Sharing many wonderful holiday moments, vacations and visits in DC, Georgia, Nantucket, Telluride, Idaho and Mexico. Celebrating President Clinton’s inauguration together in DC. You were my best buddy, cheerleader and dear and constant friend during the years that I experienced a serious and very debilitating health situation. Seared in my memory forever are the many joyful moments we shared, along with some struggles and sadness. Now, my friend, it is time to for you to rest, and when the next journey begins you will be flying with the Angels. Where else would you possibly be? Margie Another story…. I was a 14 year old teenage girl and just beginning my search for meaning. It was summertime and I was visiting Asbury Park, NJ. I went to my first Peter, Paul & Mary Concert. That evening I saw and felt something that I had never experienced before. I witnessed the coming together of extraordinary talent, Values driven music that speaks to everyone. Three harmonies voicing a call for human dignity, justice, equality love and peace. Performers giving their all to the audience and then, inviting and leading a chorus composed of a large number of audience members to experience the reality of inclusion, connection, feeling understood, seen and true community by singing together. Thus began my journey seeking to create this feeling for the rest of my life. For many it is religion, for others the glory of nature but for me it was the feelings inspired at this performance. Luckily, I enjoyed many many more PP& M concerts that helped keep this light shining bright! Love you lots, Xoxo Marge “A dragon lives forever. . . not so little boys.” I wore out my 45 rpm record of Puff. I kept hoping the ending might change the next time I played the song. A childhood of summers at Chalk Hills Camp in Northern Wisconsin followed where we sang folk songs accompanied by Flow’s 12 string guitar. Flow taught all the songs from PP&M’s solo albums and we would scour cutout bins in record shops for Peter, Paul &, and Mary albums at our respective colleges to learn the lyrics. In 1978, we ended that summer at Summerfest in Milwaukee for PP&M’s Reunion Tour. Another counselor, Sinker, landed in St Charles, Minnesota as the Dover, Eyota, and St Charles’, Minnesota newspaper editor. She covered the filming of the Willmar 8 striking bank employees interviewing Mary Beth and Lee Grant for the paper. There she learned of a benefit concert at the Mayo Clinic Auditorium. Seven counselors made it to Rochester for the concert, sitting in the row behind the patron seats. We recognized most songs at the opening chord and not halfway through the chorus of Leaving on a Jet Plane. We were invited to the reception afterward and you named us the Rochester 7, impressed with our love of the music and driving from Milwaukee, Madison and LaCrosse, Wisconsin for the concert. We continued to meet for camp reunion/PP&M concert weekends around the Midwest and remained in contact about causes and your music. Countless conversations and connections. One song we loved, Wild Places, led to you mentioning a connection with nature on a small, pristine island near Martha’s Vineyard. That led to Tree’s efforts to get you to visit another wild place, the Boundary Waters in Minnesota. So many memories from the past 50 years. There was Eugene McCarthy’s 90th Birthday Party at the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul; seeing your last Holiday Concert at Carnegie Hall with Mary; and, catching the concert with you and Christopher playing his washtub bass and singing together in Rochester, Minnesota. Causes like your work with Educators for Social Responsibility to develop the valuable curriculum for Don’t Laugh at Me resonated with the school psychologist in me. Seeing Judy Collins sing with you and Noel at one of the DLAM Conferences in DC - another special memory. It amazes me that in your somewhat fragmented lifestyle performing around the world, you and PP&M had the propensity to connect with others based on our shared love of the music and so many good causes. What a privilege to witness so many moments and see the fruits of your labor flourish. It has enriched my life knowing you. Peace and Love, Ann ‘calico’ Drivas I had the incredible privilege of working with the legendary Peter Yarrow on the Peter, Paul and Mary Lifelines record, and I must say, it was an experience I will always treasure. Peter's passion, creativity, and kindness made every moment of our sessions a joy. His dedication to his craft is truly inspiring, and I feel grateful to have had the opportunity to learn so much from him. I have fond memories of our time together in the studio. Peter's enthusiasm was infectious, and his love for the music was evident in everything he did. He brought a sense of energy and focus to every session, and his passion was inspiring. I feel lucky to have had the chance to work with Peter Yarrow, and I will always be grateful for the experience. He is a true legend in the music industry, and I feel honored to have had the opportunity to be guided by him and work alongside him. Thank you, Peter, for being such a wonderful influence and guiding light.

As a teen, I understood the power of your many songs during turbulent times of war and Jim Crow racism. Your words and music have lubricated healing among so many in the face of racism in the U.S., South Africa, and other places. I witnessed your love and determination for healing again at the Unity Concert in South Dakota, where you and Bethany performed with many tribal musicians and dancers. You have been a humble witness to love, acceptance, and forgiveness. While the night air was bitter cold, the experience warmed our hearts. My heartfelt thanks for a life well lived. Larry Schweiger Recalling Many Blessings… My first sound gig with Peter, Paul, and Mary took place in December 1979 in Florida, coinciding with my birthday. Initially, there was uncertainty about the outcome. However, Peter complimented me on the sound and inquired about the AKG microphones. I informed him that I had purchased them specifically for the event. He appeared surprised that I had bought them myself. This interaction initiated a long-lasting and positive professional relationship with Peter, Paul, and Mary. From there, our journey took us to prestigious venues around the world, including the Buddha Khan, the Sydney Opera House, Royal Albert Hall, and Carnegie Hall. We performed everywhere from Bleeker Street to Broadway, along with numerous anniversary specials for PBS. Our group was very close-knit, and although I did not play an instrument, the trio treated me as if I were a member of the ensemble. I may be one of the few people to have heard \"Puff, the Magic Dragon\" over 1,000 times; yet I never grew tired of it because each venue presented a unique challenge and learning experience because of Peter. Each audience was distinct, providing new insights every time. Touring with Peter, Paul, and Mary was immensely fulfilling. Peter is known for his meticulous approach, often pausing a concert for an impromptu sound check or adjusting a speaker by mere inches. While some groups spend a couple of hours on a sound check, Peter and I would frequently dedicate up to six hours to ensure optimal sound quality. This dedication to excellence made the work profoundly rewarding for me. At times, working at a concert venue makes it challenging to discern whether one is in Minnesota or Manhattan. However, the return performance at The Bitter End in 1985 evoked memories of the early days of folk music. This period was marked by social protest conveyed through three-part harmonies on intimate stages. It reminded me of the first instance I heard Peter, Paul, and Mary on the radio in my basement. More recently, I was impressed beyond the music when Peter contributed to the development of Braver Angels, a bipartisan organization that utilizes dialogue processes to enhance approaches to conflict resolution among Americans across the political spectrum. Following the concerts where he conveyed this idea through his music, I was compelled to commend him, recognizing the significant positive impact such initiatives have on society today. I have served as the sound engineer for Peter, Paul, and Mary for 45 years. Noel exemplified the qualities of a true Christian friend, while Mary consistently offered reliable and practical advice on nearly any subject. The group has imparted valuable lessons and highlighted the importance of listening to the lyrics instead of just the tones and melodies. However, it was Peter who encouraged me to remain with them. He assumed a father-like role, imparting essential life lessons that have made it difficult to imagine life without him. Peter, until we meet again With all my love, Davey Peter two little Jewish teachings for you: in the Torah it is said for one who is passing that \"he is gathered unto his people\"-- va'yea'sef el amav. This beautiful expression, said of Ya'akov and Aharon and Moshe --- is not merely poetic. To be gathered unto one's people is to merge with the eternity of one's roots and offshoots, one's ancestors and children. It is to become alive--in the people with whom your soul has been gathered--including us. The welcome of your people--ancestors and descendants, students, friends, fans--is with open arms, because the soul will dwell again in unity, its true place. the Hebrew word for love is ahavah (אהבה) -- it's numerological value is 13. When you double ahavah --- when love is met by ahavah rabbah (the great love) you get 13 + 13 = 26. 26 is the value of the four-letter name of g-d, Y - H - V - H, which means \"WAS, IS, WILL BE\". WAS, IS, WILL-BE is an all-encompassing, total loving of the world and of each of us in body and soul. May our lower loves--our deep and longingest loves--be merged in the Great Love, and may the Great Love be magnified through our loves. Love Jorian Polis Schutz Thanking someone for a lifetime of love and support is impossible. I first met Peter shortly after I graduated from Berkeley in the late 1970’s with a degree in Conservation of Natural Resources. Unable to find a job I took a short-term position with an anti-war organization. Peter came to California to do some fundraising concerts at Cal. After his performance we spent a long time talking about the environment and all the things that needed to be done in the world to make it better. Peter flew back home, but we continued talking on the phone. One time he even sang the song “Light One Candle” over the phone. I remember him telling me he was still writing it, but it was so moving I cried. When I landed a job in DC with Congressman Dick Ottinger (D-NY) with Peter’s help, we continued to stay in touch. I joined Peter, and his good friend Trudy Mason, for the rally at the conclusion of the ‘Great Peace March’ that went from Los Angeles to Washington, DC. At other times when I was in NYC I saw PP&M perform their annual holiday concert at Carnegie Hall. While working for Congressman Ottinger, Peter sent me a copy of an article that Christopher Yarrow wrote. That article was then published in the Congressional Record. Peter opened doors for me that I have benefited from to this day. I went from Congressman Ottinger (D-NY) to Congressman Torres (D-CA) and then was appointed by President Clinton as the nation’s first Federal Environmental Executive. Peter’s most recent impact was when he sent letters to adoption agencies on my behalf allowing me and my husband to bring home two beautiful boys from Russia in the early 1990’s. A few years later, my husband, Ron McHugh and I, took our two boys to the Filene Center at Wolf Trap National Park in Vienna Virginia and were honored to have been invited by Peter to have them meet PP&M backstage after the concert. The boys were really thrilled, and Peter was so generous with his time. As I said in the beginning, thanking someone for a lifetime of love and support is impossible, but Peter has the love and support of my entire family, especially mine. ​ Peter: You are the best – The Family Mc-Mc Fran McPoland, Ron, Alexi & Nick McHugh For Our Magic Dragon Peter Yarrow With great love and gratitude, Laura Parker Roerden I first met Peter Yarrow in 1998, when I attended a launch meeting at McGraw Hill in New York City for Operation Respect representing Educators for Social Responsibility. I wasn’t supposed to be there. Our star curriculum writer Bill Kreidler was ill, and I was asked to cover the meeting in his place. I had just moved to Italy and had not yet received the boxes we had shipped from the States, which meant I did not have business clothes with me. So I bought what I could purchase quickly—a very formal, dark charcoal suit. As I was rushing to the airport in Milan, I took out enormously big, bright blue butterfly earrings I had in my purse and put them on, worried that I was overdressed. Yet even for a meeting with a folk musician, the earrings were a bold choice. Perhaps too bold. In the taxi to the meeting, I took the butterfly earrings on and off at least twice, because I was anxious about this meeting with a celebrity. At McGraw’s offices I was met by an impressive older woman, who was introduced to me as a vice president and promptly asked, “Who are you and why are you here?” As I fumbled to explain why the senior writer she had expected was missing, Peter waltzed in joyfully with his guitar on his back, hugged me and sensing the discomfort in the room said, “I just love your butterfly earrings. You are going to be perfect. I’m Peter.” Within minutes, the air in the room had shifted and we were all singing “Puff the Magic Dragon,” now smiling with a childlike receptivity and kindness, because that is how Peter Yarrow does things. So began a quarter-century of a deep friendship, collaboration, mentorship and a very special experience of Peter’s unique magic. As the primary writer of the Operation Respect curriculum, I was fortunate to work closely with Peter. Early on I had asked Peter what his goals for the project were, expecting to hear the usual litany of metrics folks like to use: reduction of bullying behaviors, improvement in attendance, reduction in detentions. Peter simply and confidently answered, “World peace.” I laughed, because certainly he was joking. But I saw immediately: he was not. This was the moment when it hit me that Peter is a Jedi and I merely his trainee. Peter had been motivated after the Columbine shooting to do something about the increasing violence that was threatening our children in places like schools, where sanctuary from bullets should be non-negotiable. Peter understood, though, that violence is a cultural issue, and creating safety is not merely a matter of hardening buildings. He wanted to spark a movement that would ripple out from children everywhere into the world. If we could stop bullets from flying in schools and teach children the power in nonviolence, as well as the skills of resolving conflict in community, of course we could put world peace back on the table. And no one would argue that Peter Yarrow knew something about social movements, having stood on the stage with MLK, Jr. singing “Blowing in the Wind” with Peter, Paul & Mary so many years before in that and in his other many acts in the righteous fight for civil rights. Through Operation Respect, Peter was not simply preaching nonviolence or advocating for the absence of bullying. He believed the work had something to do with seating people back into their purest hearts. He felt the program needed an anthem and he found it in the beautiful Allen Shamblin and Steve Seskin song “Don’t Laugh at Me.” The song asks us to consider the perspective of those different from us and cautions to not get “pleasure from (another’s) pain.” But it does more. “Don’t Laugh at Me” points true north like a compass to our shared human vulnerability, as well as fallibility, which was beautifully captured in the Peter, Paul & Mary recording and video that became the centerpiece of the anti-bullying programming. ‘Cause I’m fat, I’m thin, I’m short, I’m tall I’m deaf, I’m blind, . . . Hey, aren't we all?” What might be possible in a world where people could truly see and acknowledge one another’s pain and vulnerability? What problems might be connected to these threads of bullying that enshrine overpowering others as a solution? How might we create a world where we could restructure the dynamics that keep us imagining violence as the only way? I remember a few weeks after 9/11, Peter and I were scheduled to present an e-learning concept for the Operation Respect curriculum at TechLearn in Orlando to gain support for spreading the work. Planes had only recently begun flying again; our nation still in shock. I had prepared a prototype of the project, with some fancy bells and whistles. But Peter wisely told me to simply put it away. He asked me instead to create a slide show featuring images of people from all over the world, of all ethnicities, abilities, and ages. While the montage playing behind us on a massive screen, Peter invited CTOs from Fortune 500 companies to cross arms and link hands. Then together they sang “We Shall Overcome” with Peter humbly accompanying on guitar. I shouldn’t have been surprised when it happened, but I’ll never forget it. The air crackled with emotion as a ballroom full of executives in suits began swaying, tears streaming down many of their faces as they sang holding hands, “Deep in my heart, I do believe, that we shall overcome. . .some. . .day.” Peter has always been fond of using terms like “catalyzing hope through song” or “activating hearts” to describe the work, but it is so much deeper than that. His commitment has been to heal the dark places by bringing a light so strong that even hate could not consume it. Peter’s celebrity opened doors for Operation Respect and along with it for bullying prevention and social and emotional learning programs across the U.S. It would not be an exaggeration to say he had an impact on an entire field of education by bringing lessons from movement building to the important work of making children everywhere emotionally healthy and safe. Peter did the rounds presenting at every national teacher conference you could name—singing, healing, and uniting teachers’ and administrators’ hearts—before even suggesting we do the same for children. He simply refused to do the work in the wooden, orthodox way that is so common in curriculum rollout and adoption. This is, I believe, where his brilliance lay. We’d ask for strategic plans and he’d instead eye the horizon for opportunity. We’d think of roles we needed filled, and he’d take people who had a heart for the work and develop them. We’d press to leverage his famous contacts and he’d put on the brakes for a better time, because of an innately uncanny sense for timing. But what else would one expect from a master musician? Peter was bringing artistry to the task of peacemaking. Other education programs unfolded in predictable ways: first pilot, then research, then revision and rollout, but Operation Respect began to have uniquely extraordinary moments. After we created a version of the program for summer camps, Peter created a youth march on Washington, with representatives like John Kerry in attendance and young people holding anti-bullying signs they had created. I believe I was the one crying that time: it was the most beautiful combination of youth empowerment and leadership with the support of powerful adults paying attention that I have ever seen. I’d be hard-pressed to think of another program that can say it was adopted by 200,000 sites in 50 countries, like Operation Respect can say of its programs. Peter’s keen intelligence and extraordinary vision was indeed drawing world attention, as the Don’t Laugh at Me curriculum was translated and rolled out into places like the Ukraine and the Middle East. Seeing children from Palestine and Israel singing together, their hearts connected and open across their differences, meant world peace no longer seemed to be so far out of reach. Spending time with Peter meant you would occasionally bump into his celebrity, even if his humility meant that most of the time you entirely forgot how famous he is. He’d take the very cheap Fung Wah bus when he travelled between NYC and Boston. He would sleep on a couch without complaint. If Peter was recognized on the street or stopped for an autograph, he would always take the time to engage sincerely and authentically. His fans would be much better described as “new friends.” If you introduced someone to Peter, you’d also have to prepare them for the embracing hug and cheek kiss they were about to get. No one was a stranger to Peter for long and everyone was worthy of his rapt attention. He simply did not have anything but wide-open love and joy in his heart for others. I remember once Peter was staying with my family in our small town in Massachusetts while we were working on a new curriculum to celebrate teachers. We took a break and walked into our downtown antique store—Peter loves antiques—and I introduced him to the owner of the store who was named Paul. I simply said, “Peter, this is Paul.” And Paul said to me without missing a beat, “Then you must be Mary.” He was making a joke to the actual Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul & Mary about the band, without even knowing this Peter was that Peter. I looked at Peter; he looked at me. And Peter said nothing. We laughed heartily when we left the store, but Peter had no desire to out himself as a celebrity. He simply took those moments in stride. Likewise, Peter could tell some of the best stories, so many of them intersecting with historic moments, most of them also very funny. I’d mention a heartbreak from my early days in high school and he’d counter: “Oh, right. That’s the worst. I remember a time that Ringo Starr stole my bird right in front of me.” When I told him I wanted to use the song “Blowin’ in the Wind” for the camp curriculum, he responded, “Let’s get Bobby on the phone now to ask.” And there you were: talking to Bob Dylan like it was the most natural thing in the world to do. Or you’d walk into his apartment and Gloria Steinem would be standing there, because they were working on a project together. Peter is simply a treasure trove of deep perspective on historic moments, largely because he has been so central to them. Peter has been mostly a mentor to me, but also is one of the best friends you could ever have. When my mother died, Peter took it upon himself to help care for my father and created quite an independent friendship with him, inviting him to his concerts and other events. When my father died, he took time out of his busy schedule to be there at his funeral bringing song as balm, singing with us in church and at graveside. I know my father would have really loved that. The joy pouring so naturally out of Peter helped us manage our grief and connected our hearts at a time when we needed one another so much. Peter would often refer of those moments as a “mitzvah for a mitzvah.” But you always knew: he wasn’t keeping score. He was freely handing out blessings wherever he went. Peter simply supported anything that the people he cares about cared about. When I wanted to start my own nonprofit, Ocean Matters, centered on youth leadership in marine conservation, Peter said yes to every request I made: from being on the board of directors, to hosting a fundraiser at his apartment, to coming with his family to Hawaii and performing a concert for an impossibly challenging fundraising trip. He even came scuba diving with the Ocean Matters staff; Peter was always game for an adventure no matter how daring. I remember once pointing out that being on our Ocean Matters incorporation papers as a director might open him to liability and he said, “I didn’t get where I got by letting risk stop me.” He was always a brave dragon, which gave us all license to be the same. I was on the phone with Peter when my sister-in-law was calling from the hospital to tell me my brother had died of a heart attack at age 52. When I called Peter back, heaving in tears and explaining that I couldn’t imagine life without my brother, he said, “Then I’ll be your brother.” That is how extraordinarily generous Peter is. Always. He promptly became Uncle Peter to our three children. As the years spun on, so did the work, as Peter was truly “weaving sunshine out of the falling rain.” There was the work with Olympians to bring character messages into schools; a curriculum devoted to acknowledging teachers built around a PBS documentary; then another program created for school children about gratitude and its place in our lives. Later when the political polarization of our nation became so intense and damaging, Peter pivoted to building bridges and supporting work that brought Democrats and Republicans together for productive and heart expanding conversations through the organization Braver Angels. After the Parkland shooting, Peter, his daughter Bethany, and Steve Seskin supported the teenage survivors through songwriting about their experience. Even though that project also bumped up against the pandemic, it resulted in a beautifully moving CD and video that showed how healing and powerful voices in service to truth can be. He empowered the teens to turn their grief into action. The last project Peter and I did together was in 2022 in response to the mental health crisis in children post-pandemic. We created an activist curriculum to empower young people in similar projects for teens as the songwriting with the Parkland survivors had done. Peter never stopped responding to the world’s pain. He simply always showed up. I remember when we were working on the curriculum about gratitude, Peter said something that has resonated deeply with me ever since. He said, “I choose to live my life from the vantage of gratitude.” “I choose. . .” is such an important way to think about our emotional life. But then again, you’d expect those sorts of deep insights from a true Jedi. When I heard this week that Peter would soon be passing into the ages, I was filled with deep sadness and loss. But I also chose to be filled with deep gratitude for the light and love he has brought so generously to me and to so many. And I also chose to return the mitzvah that knowing him has been. As the Talmud states, “Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world's grief. Do justly now, love mercy now, walk humbly now. You are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon it.” I have no doubt the best way to honor Peter is to live up to the words he penned in “Light One Candle” by continuing his important work to create a just and peaceful world: “Don't let the light go out. It’s lasted for so many years. Don’t let the light go out. Let it shine through our hope and our tears.” My Dear Peter, You are simply exceptional. In every way. Your genuine warmth, caring, authenticity, talent, have changed the world, have changed me. Thank you for showing me what it means to both live a life of service, while not forgetting the importance of presence and joy in one’s personal life. You embody love. Your love for your family, your friends, your communities, your belief in the goodness inherent in each human being, your commitment to Tikkun Olam. Thank you for being such a friend and partner in activism to my mom and dad. They adore you more than words can say. As do I. One of my favorite Peter moments: standing in your NYC apartment at an event, you feeding me and other guests with chopsticks. What a memory that was! Your vivacious and giving nature is a truly beautiful thing to witness. Thank you for everything you’ve done, and more importantly, for everything you are. You continue to inspire me, and you always will. With so much love, Danielle Moses Dear \"Uncle\" Peter, It was such an utter delight to get to know you and share so many stages with you on tour with Lonesome Traveler. Performing with you was one of the great honors of our lives and an experience that we will hold close to our hearts forever. We treasure those memories of hearing your stories, enjoying your mischievous sense of humor, and learning so much from the way you perform by fully embracing your audience with overflowing love, compassion, and humanity. Your indefatigability was and is an inspiration. Just a couple weeks ago at a gig we played together with our band we were remembering something you told us - that whenever someone performs, whether the music is political or not, just gathering a group of people together to share the experience of music is a revolutionary and world-changing act. Thank you for all you have meant to us and to the world. Much love, Justin Flagg Matt Gelfer Sam Gelfer Beau Moore Dearest Peter, I guess it’s been about 63 years you’ve had a home in my heart. A door began to open as I heard your beautifully plaintive voice on that first PP&M album in Albert Grossman’s office. Albert was convincing my grateful father, Richard, to hire PP&M to perform at Sage Hall, Smith College (the group’s first concert as it happened - sly Albert hadn’t mentioned that little fact). Following that your impish smile juxtaposed against your very serious attention to detail regarding the room’s sound at Sage Hall opened more of my heart space to you. Then you, Noel and Mary ran onto that stage and magic struck. My Aunt Georgie was sitting beside me that night. Between tunes I heard her exclaimed “I think that’s Vera Yarrow’s son Peter!”. At that my heart new space became a room. As it turned out Aunt Georgie and your mum had taught together at M&A and for me that was enough to claim you as family. Throughout the years I’ve revered your intelligence, your kindness, your creativity and maybe most of all your generosity of spirit and fostering of talent. My life has been immeasurably enriched by your presence on this planet. Your room in my heart has always been filled with light. One of the loveliest light filled memories from my youth was walking with you along Lexington Ave., to go somewhere for lunch. You turned to me, asked me to wait, crossed the street to briefly speak with someone then returned to continue our walk. When I asked who the person was you didn’t know but said you thought they looked wonderful and wanted to tell them. I’d noticed they walked a little bit prouder after your compliment. Since that day I’ve never let an opportunity pass to tell strangers when I think they look fabulous. These comments have always been met with a smile and a thank you. They feel lifted. I feel lifted. My thanks to you for that insight and those moments. People all over the world have been profoundly touched by your musical gifts, your art and benevolence. I know you have a home in each of their hearts as well. You’ve gathered a very large extended family and our love for you feels eloquent beyond words. It’s love bonded by humanity. All these many years I’ve wondered what takes us, in your sphere, beyond mere admirers no matter how or how well we’ve known you. You gave me the answer. You received the eloquence to describe it for us all - “We are all one spirit” “From the dawn of creation We are one”. And so Peter, as “it flows through you it flows through me”. Shalom, Lee I didn't sing in high school, and played clarinet. Then a group of teachers played songs at an assembly, and one was Puff, The Magic Dragon. I looked into the group Peter, Paul, and Mary and was hooked on folk music. And when you did Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane,\" and Lightfoot's \"Early Morning Rain,\" I bought a guitar my senior year (Mom helped). 52 years later I am a songwriter (folksy stuff or ballads), songlead at church, and learned to sing harmony. I owe you and your friends for that beautiful addition to my life story. Many of my values are based in songs you did. It started with Puff and his dragon. I consider myself to identify most with you, in the threesome. The highest compliment someone gave me once was that I reminded her of you. THANK YOU for the music, the messae, and the life you have lived. ​ - Tom Langr You made me the person I am today. You , Mary and Noel were my idols. I was a fat , shy kid in the 60’s who had a couple of friends. I did have a decent voice but seldom used it. Another girl and I would listen to your albums over and over till we knew every song by heart. We started a folk Mass at church and would end with The Song is Love. We acquired two guys who were great guitarists and became The Russet Mantle. We sang at local colleges for special events. Never a big deal but we loved it and people loved us. The shy girl I was became a woman who loved herself. I knew I could sing on that stage and sing better than 90% of the people there. I wouldn’t hide in a corner trying to vanish. I’m 75 now and I go and drag the person out of the corner and make them sing with us. I’m still overweight but no one will ever believe I was shy. It’s all because of you and your magnificent group. I still try to stand up for what’s right and you helped me learn that too. I’m an old lady and still sing at wine bars and cabarets occasionally. I just wanted to say thank you for making me, me. ​ - Linda Martin When I was young, I heard Peter and the group sing on an album at a friend's house. To say I was instantly smitten is an understatement. Unable to get to concerts, I played records and tapes til they wore right out. Later, as an adult, for several years, we attended Peter Paul and Mary concerts at Wolftrap as part of fundraisers for the local non-profit TV channel. We were taken to meet Peter and Mary a few times, with our then-small daughter. Peter was wonderful with her, playing with her, singing gently with her. His presence really made those concerts special. The memories are touchstones for us to this day. I also remember one concert where the audience would NOT quit singing along. Peter got a bit firm with us, and actually got quiet for a song or two before the whole sing-along thing started over again. What he and Mary and Noel put up with from their fans! ​ - Carolle Cox Dearest Peter, Although you don’t know me… I was lucky enough, many years ago, to go back stage at the Greek Theatre to meet you after a beautiful heart felt concert! You were both kind, genuine and responsive and I was forever grateful for that! Very often, you grow to love the artists that you follow because of similar dreams and hopes you share…. We certainly shared the same passion for peace and compassion. I went to every concert that I was able to attend in California… I always kept my antennae up! I, too, battled cancer and can relate to what you’re going through…I am sending good wishes and kind thoughts for you To stay strong and free from pain .thank you for all the pleasure and enjoyment you have given me thru your music . Warmly , Murphy Romano A lady from California Like so many of my generation - of many generations - Peter's music has been part of the soundtrack of my life. I heard the trio sing \"Day in Done\" in a concert in Madison in 1969 and then heard the trio the next week at the big anti-war march in DC. It became a go-to song for me to sing to my kids. And there are personal moments as well. When my wife and I heard him sing \"With Your Fade to the Wind (Harriet's Song)\" at a concert in Madison WI, we knew it would be an important song for a friend who was an avid cyclist and who was dying of cancer. But it was not yet on an album, We reached out to Peter and he sent a us a cassette tape (remember those?) recorded in his apartment and later we played it at our friend's funeral. The words he wrote then fit him now - \"Yes, there are hands here to comfort you / And if you need there are tears to cry with you too.\" I had the pleasure of meeting him a few times over the years. A gentle sprit, a committed activist, a catalyst for change and an amazing musician. He is always a blessing to our world. ​ - Phil Haslanger My first introduction to Peter, Paul, and Mary was when I was 6 years old. My dad called me into the room to watch you perform Puff the Magic Dragon. It was the first time I ever heard it, and I will never forget it. I fell in love with that song and that dragon. Then a few years later, my dad bought a cassette tape of Peter, Paul, and Mary’s greatest hits, and I was hooked. I was that shy, scared, weird (would later find out autistic), bullied kid at school —the kid who never said a word—when I was in 5th grade, the 6th graders made a wish board, and one wish was that I had a voice. It took me a long time to find a voice, but I have your music to thank for it. I remember in high school, I used to carry a stack of Peter, Paul, and Mary cd’s for comfort. I had my headphones on whenever I could get away with it. I have seen Peter, Paul, and Mary in concert at least half a dozen times, and in November of 2023, I had the pleasure of taking my 16 year old daughter, Abigail, to your concert with Paul at the Genesee Theater in Waukegan (front row right hand side). I got to watch my daughter cry tears of joy just as I had the first time I saw you guys perform (at the Midland Theater in KC)—when I was around her age. In fact, she has become such a fan, she has taught herself to play many of your songs on her guitar. I remember when I was around 18 years old, I worked so hard to win some tickets to a concert you were doing in Kansas City (at Starlight theater), and I won them, but I got terrible seats so far back that I couldn’t see you guys. I was so upset, my mom somehow got me backstage passes to your show in Denver (Fiddler’s Green). My dad drove through the night to get us there, and I got to take pictures with you and Paul, and Mary gave me a hug, and I so wanted to tell you how much your music meant to me, but I didn’t have a voice at that time, and I didn’t say a word, and I’ve always regretted it. Peter, Paul and Mary kept me going through hard times. They helped me survive the bullying. I have been very blessed to have your music in my life, and I am so happy to see my children (all 8 of them—especially my daughter Abby—now 17) love your music the way I have and always will. Thank you for being there for me when I needed you the most. Thank you for helping me find my voice. ​ - Jennifer Vanags I was nine years old when first introduced to Peter, Paul and Mary’s music. It was magical! Got my first guitar at the age of 10, and have been singing and playing ever since. Many kids are beginning to form their world views and social consciousness at around 10 yrs. old, and I have to say that PPM, as well as others in the folk movement, had a huge influence on my formation. I was thrilled to have experienced a couple of PPM concerts through the years, and even more thrilled to have met Peter at a Madison bookstore when he signed one of his books for me, then kissed my hand when he learned I was a teacher. I considered not washing my hand for a while, but as it was mid-flu season in kindergarten - it got washed! I used his books and CDs at school, as well as singing with my guitar regularly. As I am now retired, I still meet former students who, if they remember little else, still remember the music with love! I may be only one little teacher, impacting just a few lives at a time - certainly not the millions over the years, that PPM have impacted - but my hope is that my own impact has moved like concentric circles, inspiring kids to love others, act with kindness, without bullying, and make their own positive impact, large or small, on this world that so needs hope and activism. I have PPM to thank for their influence, and I am so grateful for that! Now battling ovarian cancer myself, I have some idea of what our beloved Peter is going through. I do pray that God will wrap loving arms around Peter, comfort him and his family, and welcome him home when the time is right. Lovingly, Carolyn My parents met Peter, Paul, and Mary on one of their first dates - My dad was working backstage at a concert venue, and he snuck my mom in. She got their autographs on a slip of paper, each were written in pencil. When I came along, they sang me your songs as lullabies. My first concert was Peter, Paul and Mary, when I was five years old. I sat transfixed, singing along with the songs that I knew. Many years later, I was living in Boston and Peter was giving a reading at a book store for his Puff the Magic Dragon book (It was the day after President Obama was elected the first time - Hope and change were in the air!). I went, and listened to Peter read, and sing for just a small group of us. Afterwards he took his time speaking with each one of us. I told him about my experience at that concert as a child, and he held my hands and asked \"how old were you?\" - \"five\" I said, and he said \"you'll always be five to me.\" I cried! I had booked tickets for my parents, my partner, and I to see Peter at the concert here in Whitehall Michigan (I live just down the street from the Playhouse) which was cancelled. I am so glad that he has been such a big part of my life. Thank you Peter for everything. ​ - Jenna Brown I was driving Peter from his apartment to a LI theater where he was headlining a benefit concert for my special needs program. We talked about everything; he got a call from out of state, might have been Christopher, who was visiting family....Peter said \"yes, yes, put him on.....\" and I believe he said \"HI Mac\" as it was Gene McCarthy. It was a kick to hear Peter's side of the conversation.....He said goodbye, turned to me and said \"where were we ?.......oh yes, the secret to a successful marriage, in fact any long term relationship ?.......................share a public bath with your partner........you won't believe how that brings people together\" ...I told my wife later on, she was willing to share a bath with me, but ixnayed the 'public' part, to which I said \"Barb, he was very adamant about it being a public bath\" LOL...............Peter< I wasn't the only one with whom you shared that secret, was I ?? I love you, always, and may I thank you, Noel and Mary, the music was essential to my Life, to many, but you and your partners did something more than symbolic. You often sang in a semi circle, it enabled you to sing and look at the other 2, but it also brought the audience into that broken circle, we were a part of something more than a concert. ​ - Barry Nisman Watching PBS’s Frontline and Associated Press’ Korea’s Adoption Reckoning Documentary in late September ignited a personal reckoning for me as I am processing my identity as a Korean Adoptee now in reunion. As I listened to Korea’s adoption history and how international players led to more than 200,000 Korean adoptions, I woke up. For 40 years I let others tell my story and let my life story happen to me. After watching this PBS documentary my Korean Adoptee (KAD) voice had an internal reckoning of my own psyche, identity, and purpose. My own reckoning brought up a so many questions about war and humans response to society's problem. I have been afraid to publicly share my response as I have been fearful of my own voice and (imagined) violation of “the rules of response.” Yet as the seasons change and the freezing winter weather brings snow to my motherland South Korea and the cold air surrounds me in my Maryland home, the fearfulness of my own adoptee voice freezing up reignites the fire inside me. Now is the time for me to share my own adoption story as it is happening. Yes, the story of war trauma and adoption trauma continues because I am the story, I am a Korean Adoptee- Chana Bilek. Here is my response to the PBS Documentary: Korea’s Adoption Reckoning. As I tried to figure out my response, I felt the confusion and pain deep in my gut. I then heard the stanza repeat over and over again in my head “Where have all the flowers gone?”. Finally I asked myself the question “Where have all the fathers gone?” and this is what bloomed. Inspired by Peter Paul and Mary’s Song: Where Have All The Flowers Gone (1962). Oh, When Will They Ever Learn Chana Bilek (October 2024) Who must you listen to now? Strong KAD, KAD voices. Who must you listen to now? You gave no choices. What did the agencies fail? Failed man's morality. What did the agencies fail? Accountability. Oh, When will they ever learn? Learn, learn The Creator's Truth. Oh, When will they ever learn? Which ways will adoption change? Answers lie in questions of rage. Which ways will adoption change? Adult adoptees will take stage. Where did all the fathers go? They ran, ran away. Where did all the fathers go? They must also pay. Oh, When will they ever learn? Learn, learn The Creator's Truth. Oh, When will they ever learn? Where have all the mothers been? Been shut down and out. Where have all the mothers been? No one let them shout. Where have all the children gone? Thousands were sent far, far, far away. Where have all the children gone? Governments let money lead the way. Oh, When will they ever learn? Learn, learn The Creator's Truth. Oh, When will they ever learn? Why don't we start learning now? Hold guilt, pride, happiness, and shame. Why don't we start learning now? Relationship laws guide life's game. How can I not find my voice? To ignore the complexity is a choice. How now can I find my voice? Leave the adoption fog and truly rejoice. Oh, When will they ever learn? Learn, learn The Creator's Truth. Oh, When will they ever learn? I humbly thank you Peter Yarrow for inspiring me! P.S. I'm also very blessed to have had a chance to see you perform with Paul in Baltimore Maryland a few years ago at the JCC Pikesville. With love and gratitude, Chana Bilek I was working with Peter, Noel and Mary as the Associate Producer of A Peter, Paul & Mary Holiday Concert for PBS. I was a bit of a fan girl, having grown up with the trio’s music since I was a little girl and learning to play it all on my guitar. I flew in from Los Angeles for prep and we held a rehearsal at Lincoln Center. My car pulled up and Peter was there at the entrance to the rehearsal space. He said, “you must be heidi….so nice to finally meet you in person”. I followed Peter into the space. He introduced me to Noel and Mary and Dick Kniss and Shelly Belusar. The hall was empty except for the sound and lighting people, me, Rudi Goldman (EP & Director), Ken Fritz & Martha Hertzberg. The trio was on stage and thru his microphone, Peter said, “Let’s warm up. Heidi, I heard that your favorite song is Day is Done. We will play that for you now.” It was a dream come true. Peter, your kindness and thoughtfulness always meant the world to me. We have many memories and laughs together; stories too numerous to mention. Peter, I am sending you strength and peace. You are the most amazing and gifted soul. R’fuah Shlema. I love you. xoxo Heidi Maybe about ..mmmm...10 years ago Peter appeared at The State Room in Salt Lake City and I had tickets. At the last minute my wife found that she could not go, so I took my daughter who was a young Writing student at the University of Utah. I thought that it would be special for her to meet someone who had such an impact on our history, my history. At the end of the show Peter was standing at the edge of the stage talking to people. I introduced my daughter to him and next thing I knew Peter's hand was on my shoulder as he used me as support to climb down off of the stage to speak to my daughter face to face. He asked her what she was inspired by and listened intently to her answers. He gave her encouragement. It was like there was no one else in the room as he encouraged her to follow her dreams. What an amazing man. I hope my daughter remembers it, I certainly will never forget it. ​ - Michael Downie Way back in the 60s, PP&M were at the coliseum in Winston-Salem, NC. I was a student at Wake Forest University. I went with friends to see the concert. We hung around after hoping to meet them and when most everybody had left and no one stopped us, we walked behind the stage through a curtain opening. Paul was standing over near a car talking with several people. We saw an open door and walked unto basically a “green” room. Several people were sitting on benches talking with Mary and Peter. We were invited to join them. I asked about the D-28 Martin he was playing. After about 30 minutes, things were winding down and Peter asked, “Who was the one who was going to carry his guitar to the car?” I assumed it was me and so I did. What a kind man he was. Over the years I saw them 7 times in concert. What a group! Love you Peter Yarrow. Fight the good fight as long as you can. God bless your soul! ​ - Jerry McDowell The first song I ever learned was “freight train“; I was familiar with that song by Peter Paul and Mary. My friend taught me how to do a four finger finger pic but wouldn’t lend me his guitar. So I built on a block of 2 x 4 six wires and practiced. The next week when I showed him That I could do the finger pick key showed me how to make a chord (I think it was C; circa 1960s, late) Today, from some friends, I hadn’t seen in 40 years. I’ve acquired a guitar that Peter had drawn a caricature of himself and signed for station KTWU in Topeka, KS, For a fundraiser. I’m very happy to have this, it makes me smile. I saw Peter at the Jewish community center event (annual)) in Kansas City years ago, it made me smile then as well. I’m gratified to have this guitar. I’m playing it tomorrow at the Jam at my local coffee shop and I’m grateful, Baruch Hashem, That Peter is still with us. Thank you, Peter for so much for so long Alan Dear Peter, Yes, I do feel I can call you Peter and not Mr. Yarrow because you, your music and your passion for equality and justice have always been a part of my life. I was born the year the \"In Concert\" album was released and I grew up listening to it and all the other albums. As I child I simply loved the music, as an adult I came to love and appreciate your commitment to the causes of peace, equality and justice and have, especially in the past decade, looked to you for inspiration and guidance in navigating the political climate we have found ourselves in. The world is a better place today because of you and your legacy will live on through your music and your family. To Bethany, Christopher and the rest of your family and friends, thank you for sharing Peter with us for so many years. Sending lots of positive thoughts and energy your way. ​ - Janet Bradshaw I graduated from high school in 1969. That should give you a good idea of the world I lived in. The songs that Peter, along with Noel Paul and Mary, sang to us inspired, soothed and taught us about laughter, the world around us, acceptance of each other and how to be better people. My children were introduced to their songs from the time they were born. My four year old granddaughter will be the next generation to sing those songs. Numerous concerts over the years have truly enriched our lives. One stands out for me. It was an evening with just Peter in a barn-like theater during a snowstorm. The power went out but the show went on thanks to cellphone flashlights. It was wonderful and so much more personal. Afterwards, I went to say thank you to Peter and we ended up talking about my job at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Hospital and about my Vietnam Veteran husband. I’ve never forgotten those special moments of personal time I got to spend with an incredible, empathetic, genuinely caring man. For seven years, I took care of two children who lived across the street from us. Because they are Jewish and we aren’t, I learned a great deal about myself. Together, we learned to sing “Light One Candle “, year round! Peter, you are truly loved and have been a great blessing for my family. Thank you for being who you are. ​ - Jan Mohrfeld My husband and I attended five or six separate concert of PP&M during our marriage. It was one of the things that bound us together, our love for their music. We had all the recordings, both in vinyl and CD. Whenever we took a road trip, that is what we sang along to, as well as John Denver. Since my husband’s death, I find comfort in listening to those songs again, it brings him close to me. Another important thing, when I was in grade school, in the early 1970s, one of my favorite teachers and her husband sort of adopted my two older sisters and me. I was probably 8 or 9 at the time. I remember going to their house and singing along to PP&M tunes and shaking maracas and playing other instruments. Those songs were what I used to reunite with my sisters after a long estrangement. I sent each of them a copy of the CD of the album I remembered. It helped us to communicate again. Thank you Peter, you have been part of my life for nearly 60 years. ​ - Joan Diamond I was 10, and Woodstock was a wonderment a long ways away. I was in Montana, and couldn't drive. There was an old school bus the teenagers were painting and I painted a flower on it. All the colors were considered psychedelic ( totally cool) . I wanted to go soooo bad but my parents were not having that at 10 . The day the bus left, man I was bummed. This older girl told me she was going to the coffee house to listen in to tunes and asked me if I wanted to go. WOW it sounded pretty cool. So I went. It was a broken down 2 story apartment building. Outside their was gray tarpaper shingles, WOW on the inside, pillows on the floor, (thought was weird) black light posters, more peace signs and a massive stereo system. So I was watching my first lava lamp, and this song came on that caught my attention fast. It was called Blowin in the Wind. It was deep. And I listened to the rest of the album with all these ( older) teenagers. And when John flipped the album , I asked who the group was. Low and behold it was Peter, Paul and Mary. I was so excited , I played the guitar, not hard to follow the music, I was playing their tunes. I told my new found ...older friends I was playing them , I got invited to play with them. So all of my extremely great new experiences, were thanks to Peter , Paul and Mary ​ - Connie Dauch I had the unbelievable honor and great pleasure of being the \"promoter\" for two PP&M benefit concerts for Habitat for Humanity in Melbourne, Florida in 1990 and 1991. The first concert in 1990 raised over $25,000, which was enough to fully fund a HFH house at the time. It was an amazing experience. But perhaps even more amazing was the second show, almost two years later (delayed over six months as Mary had to recover from a severe case of laryngitis and it took that long before Peter, Noel Paul and Mary could work out the rescheduling because of their busy individual schedules). I remember that second event primarily because of Peter and several things he did - the first was the fact that he had his right arm in a cast, as he'd broken it in a skiing accident but had told his doctor in no uncertain terms that the cast must be applied and his arm set in a manner where he could still play his guitar, as there were shows to perform. His wishes were met and, indeed, he played our benefit performance with that right arm in a cast and his fingers held in place by the cast such that he could still hold his guitar pick. The second was the moment he and the other two members of the trio entered the green room for their pre-show dinner. The meal was only chicken (we were attempting to keep costs down, of course, as we sought to maximize the funds raised), although finely prepared by a local caterer with linen table cloths and good china. We'd used the same caterer (and nice settings) the first time around. Peter absolutely lit up when he came into the room and saw the preparations, exclaiming \"I REMEMBER THIS ROOM!\" When Peter smiles, his heart shines through those eyes and that wonderful smile. I'm sure anyone else who has met him will certainly agree with that statement. His heart was shining with gratitude at that moment! The third involved our daughter, Sally Beth, who was five at the time. She had been too young to attend the first concert, but we had her with us in the front row at the second. When Peter saw her he insisted that we lift her up on stage so that all three of them could publicly fawn over her. She insists that she remembers that moment (she's now 38 and has been living in Japan for 14 years). I don't know if she really does, but her mother and I certainly do. Finally I had the pleasure of driving Peter from Melbourne over to Orlando the next morning, as he had a meeting with an Orlando radio station that was playing children's music in the central Florida market. As we approached our destination I pointed out the arena where the Orlando Magic NBA basketball team played and mentioned that their big green fuzzy mascot was named \"Stuff the Magic Dragon.\" Peter perked up at this news and took out his notebook to record a note to himself, as he had no prior knowledge of this fact. Amazingly, just a few months later, the team announced that their mascot was now to be known as \"Stuff the Magic mascot\" and they were going to be doing some promotional work with a certain Orlando radio station with a \"kids music\" format. I smiled to myself when I heard this news, as I knew who had worked behind the scenes to make THAT change happen! Peter, you have been such a blessing, to so many. Thank you for a life well lived. God speed, sir. We shall always love you, not just for your music, but for your absolutely beautiful heart. Rest well and please know that you and your family are all in our prayers ​ - Chris Moore My very first concert at age 8 in 1963 was to a Peter, Paul, and Mary concert in Chicago. When Peter dedicated Puff to the children in the audience, my father leaned down and whispered to me, “This song is for you.” I looked around and saw only grown-ups. I knew at that moment that it was for me. That moment led to a lifetime of music, teaching, and activism. Many years later at a conference where Peter spoke to school administrators in Michigan regarding his anti-bullying “Don’t Laugh at Me” program he sang This Land. I, being an elementary music teacher who taught ASL as a way to help Littles with lyrics, sang and signed along. As he kept playing he asked me to join him on stage and sign along. I did. After, he asked me to remain on stage during his closing song, We Shall Overcome. He put his arm over my shoulder as I signed and sang the anthem of my life’s work with the man who inspired me to it. Though I am a retired teacher I am still a community organizer, elected official, musician, and activist. All this began with a song dedicated to children in 1963. Thank you Peter Yarrow, for inspiring, and setting me on my life’s path. You have profoundly impacted thousands by impacting me as a little girl. ​ - Tiyi Schippers I don't know you, dear Peter, and yet you have been like family throughout my life. Your presence has been like tones of music which are felt in and remembered by the sinews, the heart, long since the song stopped, or the way the sunlight feels when it sneaks out from between clouds and warms the heart. To state the obvious, know that you are loved and heard and felt, where even strangers are called upon to reach out to you and your family, your closest friends, to offer - love - just for you being yourself! You and Mary and Noel once sang Kate Wolf's song - which just popped into mind now - Give Yourself to Love: ...\"Kind friends all gathered 'round There's something I would say That what brings us together here Has blessed us all today. Love has made a circle that holds us all inside Where strangers are as family, and loneliness can't hide You must give yourself to love, if love is what you're after Open up your hearts to the tears and laughter And give yourself to love, give yourself to love...\" ​ - Erica Zweig There is a wonderful fable-tale written by the Ukrainian philosopher Hryhorii Skovoroda called \"Grace-given Erodii\" (Blahodarnyi Erodii). Having worked as a dramaturg at the Les Kurbas Theatre in Lviv Ukraine, where this is performed, I decided to translate it into English...and spent 17 years (on and off) doing so, as it is highly stylized in structure and joy, ...and also because it was for my soul and not for commerce. The tale is a philosophical discussion between a Stork (Erodii) and Monkey (Pishek) on the meaning of being brought up well, and grace. Somewhere around year 14 of the revisited translation, a moment of connection happened with you: I realized that you (& Noel & Mary) where there alongside me as part of my upbringing. The years of listening and learning about how harmony functions to tell a story, to fill a page or a room or a soul or souls or nations had been and remains deeply imprinted upon my reasonings and actions in how I navigate the world. Thank you for this. I once wrote you a letter long long ago (which you answered) about how when I was a child terrified of thunder my father would play \"Day is Done\" and it always brought me to a place of calm; and how as young adult, the thunder had morphed into the sounds of the world's darknesses, but the constant of the song's care remained. ...and I feel this reverberation now, literally sitting in an air raid alert in Ukraine; filled with the love of a wonderful human being--whose hand has helped many of us to the wellness of when the day is done-- than the monstrosity behind the thunderously wailing sirens. I've been well brought up. Thank you for your part in all these processes. I wish you beauty, love and peace. Julie. I don't know Peter personally, but I contacted him last year to ask if he would participate in the memorial for a mutual friend, Roger Deitz, who had suddenly passed away last year. Peter couldn't make it because of his medical issues, but he took the time to send me the most heartwarming response, which I've copied below. My best wishes for a peaceful experience as Peter enters hospice, and I think I have the right to also convey Roger's best wishes even though he left us. \"Brother Rick, I would have loved to have joined you, my friend, but I have some scheduled medical tasks that conflict. Thank you for reaching out on Rodger's behalf and go well, my brother. In this draconian time, we do well to keep singing and keep our friendships front and center, yes? Onward, in peace and gratitude, Peter\" ​ - Rick Ilowite Dear Peter, On August 31, 2005, I had written a personal, supportive message to Mary as she struggled with AML. I had just recovered from a bone marrow transplant for the same disease and took a leap of faith that I could offer her some hope and comfort as someone had done for me a year prior. I was surprised and incredibly touched when I received a thank you note from you! I have loved your music since I was a child. “Puff” brings instant memories of my Mom, which I cherish. I live next to Gordon and had gotten tickets to see you at The Kate last Summer which was postponed to 2025. It was going to be a musical highlight for me! I may be a spec in the ocean of people who care for you and wish you well, but I will keep you in my thoughts as you travel this path you are on, and your music will always be in my head. Godspeed, Pam Southworth Peter’s generosity was a gift that left a lasting imprint on my heart. Though we didn’t know each other deeply, he graciously invited me to share the stage with him on several occasions—at the Kerrville Folk Festival and a fundraiser for Kol Halev, the cherished temple in Austin. One moment, in particular, stands out. We were preparing to sing 500 Miles at the fundraiser, and after a brief rehearsal, he turned to me with that familiar twinkle in his eye and said, “Sing softer this time.” Amused, I asked why, and he replied, “So the audience can hear me!” His humor dissolved my nerves, making me realize I’d probably been singing louder than intended. I relaxed, and together we created something beautiful, a performance I’ll always treasure. Years earlier, I had been a singing waiter at a Los Angeles restaurant called the Great American Food and Beverage Company. My most requested song was Puff the Magic Dragon, a tune that invited everyone to join in. That song was part of the soundtrack of my youth, a time when Peter's voice was a constant presence, shaping my teen and young adult years with his music and his message. Peter’s courage to stand against injustice and his ability to unite hearts through song have left an indelible legacy. For that, and for the laughter, the music, and the shared moments, I am forever grateful. Peter, your light has touched so many. I love you. ​ - Donna Lipman My dear friend, Bob Donahue, took me to my first Peter and Paul concert in Massachusetts several years ago and then treated me to a wonderful show last year at the Katharine Hepburn Cultural Arts Center in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. First row, center seats! I knew to bring tissues to both performances, wisely! Bob and I cried through so many songs…for nostalgia and for the here and now ongoing journey you and Paul were taking us on. Traveling with you two truly brought us to higher ground. My friend Bob may be your most devoted fan, is that even possible? He has every record, every piece of paraphernalia, newspaper clippings, knows everything you’ve done, your accomplishments, all of your projects. We were allowed to bring records to sign, there was a limit, Bob gave me several more of his for you to sign for his massive collection. You were so gracious, signed everything, looked us in the eyes and were totally there with us in the moment. I am a huge fan as well and also loved being a younger sister to my older sisters, total fans! - wearing pleated skirts and turtlenecks to your shows in the ‘60s in your iteration of Peter, Paul and Mary. They hung on every lyric as we do now. We cried bittersweet tears for the tenacity of your worthy stances through the years and happy tears just to hear the music! You give joyously to a world desperately in need of joy. Your belief in the good of Humankind is contagious. I cherish the pictures with you and Paul, Bob and me after the show. You have the warmest hug, your humor and the twinkle in your eyes lasted into the afterglow of the performance. Shows I will remember forever. Thanks for acknowledging me as a fellow traveler. Light and love to you and your family and to all who love you… Cyndie Hasty It is difficult to know where to begin. Peter has been a joyful and uplifting presence in my life for almost as long as I am able to remember. I look back and vividly recall joyfully singing “Puff” as a child, together with friends, on our school playground. And then pinching myself when, decades later, I stumbled upon a mysterious help wanted ad in the NY Times and had the great good fortune to be hired as Peter’s assistant. Of course his intelligence, boundless energy, and commitment to so many important issues were inspirational on a daily basis, but his warmth, patience, humor and generosity were also touching and deeply affecting. I loved getting to know Peter, and I loved watching the effect he had on others, the care he extended to so many. Not only was he kind to me, but also incredibly thoughtful with my children and husband. To this day, I refer to life lessons he exemplified, and I treasure hundreds of memories from the time I was able to share with him. I have long recognized, and don’t at all take for granted, that meeting Peter has been one of the luckiest experiences of my life. Love him, love him, love him. ​ - Jennifer Parkinson Peter, Paul, and Mary have been my favorite musical group since I started listening to music in my dad's car, a \"61 VW bug. They are the reason \"folk music\" will always be my favorite genre. They are the reason their station on Pandora gets the most listens, no matter what I'm doing. I first heard \"Blowing in the wind\" sung by my outdoor education camp counselor when I was in fifth grade. My life has been informed and molded by the stories told in PP&M songs, whether written and performed or just performed by them. Their version has always been my favorite! I bought their 50 years with Peter, Paul and Mary DVD while watching a PBS special; it is a treasure that I return to often when I need to be reminded that there are good, decent, compassionate, and oh so talented people fighting the good fight for social justice and equality. Thank you Peter Yarrow for being one of those people; your legacy lives on in me, my husband and both of our now adult children. We are all still \"fighting the good fight.\" ​ - Alison Unterreiner I loved the original trio, and both Peter's solo and the joint Peter and Paul performances since Mary's death. I well remember Peter's determination during the intermission to autograph the tickets of all of us in the line at one of his concerts at Elgin Community College in Illinois. He was persuaded to stop signing because of the number of small children in the audience, who were up way past their bedtimes, but was torn between his \"duty\" to his older and his youngest fans. I was among the last to get my ticket signed, and value it still. Although I had an hour or more to drive home after the concert ended, I did not care how late it got. I would happily have stayed there all night, listening to one of my favorite musicians ever! With heart-felt gratitude, thank you for a lifetime (both yours and mine-I am 82) of songs!!!!! ​ - Elizabeth Cerny My two encounters other than simply attending events with the trio or the duo are testaments to Peter’s dedication to quality in performance art. Once at the Cerritos Performing Arts Center we were visited in our box by Peter Yarrow checking on the quality of the sound system during Noel’s solo set. We conveyed our admiration for the excellent audio. He thanked us and withdrew. At another concert at the Irvine Amphitheater we got another visit when Peter crouched down during Mary’s solo set and inquired if the audio mix had been that good at the beginning of the concert. I assured him that it was and offered that having once owned a recording studio I felt qualified to answer the question. The last time we had the privilege of hearing he and Noel Paul two months ago we noticed the physical manifestation of his struggle disappeared while playing and singing. Thank you Peter for burning so brightly in your time in this realm! ​ - Dave Bremer Aloha: I did not know. I guess my retiring from the folk music community in the Washington DC area and moving to Honolulu 8 years ago, I kind of got out of the loop. I was for several years co-president, vice president and I am a member still of the board of the World Folk Music Association. Peter, you remember Dick Cerri? (Often referred to with love, as Mr. FoIk Music. I worked with him from college (grew up with his radio program from junior high on - Music Americana) until he left us in 2013. I was his production manager for the program. Peter, you and Noel were part of several of our annual concerts and all three of you often interviewed live on his program. You were always generous with your time and so cooperative as these concerts featured many folk performers each time. Noel and Mary too, of course. You were always so gracious and kind to me. Sometimes when all those performers were meeting to get organized just before the concert began, you would help me corral them and quiet them so we could plan an always wonderful finale featuring all the performers. This was sometimes as many as 20 different acts! AND you would always ask me what you could do to help. My goodness. We even talked about the possibility that after I arrived in Hawaii, you would come, and we would get together. Though that did not happen, I loved that you considered it. Peter, thank you ever so much for all the music and care and your always immediate response when I would reach out to you for ideas or invite you and Noel and Mary to our events. Much later, after Mary passed, we talked as a joke that you two could keep on going and I could be the third member! Such an honor that would have been no matter how far-fetched that was! Wow, just joking with you meant a lot to be. I have always been a super fan of the trio and your solo activities since I was in junior high and will always adore your music. I still do performances here and often the singalongs are Peter, Paul and Mary songs, everyone's request! I love and respect you so much, as a person and a musican. Love, Aloha and in harmony, Doris Dear Peter, I was so sad to hear this news. Please know you and your family are in my prayers. Just really want to sincerely thank you for your songs, your dedication and your spirit. You’ve certainly been an inspiration to me over the years. (I’m 77). I started listening to PPM back in the mid 60s. You were the spark that got me to start playing guitar and I’d try to emulate your voice. My first and favorite was Gilgarra Mountain and Day Is Done. I played them often and videotaped myself back in the mid 80s’ playing them with my 2 year old daughter dancing and mugging at the camera. It’s a hoot and we always get a big kick out of seeing it. In basic training, ( I was drafted in ‘‘67), I’d sing Gilgarra Mountain to myself when we went of a forced march to a remote bivouac area. It kept me going… Sorry we never met in person…but I’ll always remember your spirit and the inspiration you gave me. Respectfully, from a big fan, Ken Back in '64, my sister Lynn, who was 15 at the time, got a nylon string guitar for Christmas. I was seven years old. I don't remember asking her to teach me how to play, nor do I remember her offering to teach me. It just happened. She was learning how to finger-pick from a guy she knew in high school, and she started teaching me. The first three songs I learned to play were Puff, the Magic Dragon, A-Soalin', and Talkin' Candy Bar Blues. :) I have not stopped finger-picking, and in fact just broadcast a show on a web site called streetjelly.com this past Wednesday, and I sang and played all three songs. Puff has been a favorite and one that people request, repeatedly. I'm so thankful to have learned it. Thank you so much for giving this and so much more to the world. Your FolkSinging Friend, Billie p.s. my middle name is Preston, so my stage name is Billie Preston. If you know, you know. :) I had a moment to offer deep gratitude for a song he sung solo when Peter, Paul and Mary stepped outdoors to meet with fans after a concert at Westbury Music Fair. My father had died years earlier after a heroic tolerance of rare cancer after being exposed at TMI. Peter sent me a copy of the song in a cassette. Finally, I could grieve my father's passing. Fast forward 15 yrs. I was able to personally thank him for sending the cassette at an after concert gathering I attended after a P, P&M concert in Philadelphia. He rembered my dad's story, he remembered sending the cassette. Who does this? Someone with a heart bigger than the galaxy. I love Peter, his humanity, his voice of outrage, his heart of gold, his humanity. I offer deep gratitude for the gift of his commitment to bring a voice to essential and important causes. He has enriched our globe and I am honored having hugged him. I learned about social justice from him as I assimilated in America in the early 60's. I was a young child, learning English, and was able to grasp social justice through their music. I have followed his music for more than 60 years! May rest and peace be with him. ​ - Holly DeYoung I was born in 1976 and grew up listening to the music of Peter, Paul, and Mary thanks to my parents. Puff the Magic Dragon was one of my favorite songs as a child. I grew to love Light One Candle and so many other more serious songs. When my dad was dying of lymphoma this summer we tried to find music to soothe him. Nothing we tried worked until we put on Peter, Paul, and Mary. I couldn't help but think as Blowin' In The Wind was playing that maybe my dad would soon have those answers. The last song my mom and I sang to him was Puff the Magic Dragon and the last song he heard the notes to was Leaving on a Jetplane. I know your music gave him, and us, peace. His music was invaluable in so many moments of my life. I truly believe Puff never dies and that we all still have that faith in magic within us, if we only look. ​ - Kathy One of my first memories as a child is Peter, Paul and Mary singing. Their voices caught my ear and introduced me to social justice and the call to not merely be a witness, but to be that person who uses their words and whatever talent or strength to stand up for others. To stand up for what is right. To make this world better by my presence. I grew up in a pretty isolated and insulated family, surrounded by racism and intolerance. The power of the music of this trio is that their words echoed in my mind and made me start doing my own research into history, into what it means to be a human, a friend and a neighbor, whether to the person next door or someone on the other side of the world. My third daughter was born chronically ill. One of my favorite songs to sing her when she was in pain was \"How Can I Keep From Singing/The Great Storm Is Over.\" On \"Lift up your wings and fly,\" I'd pick her up and raise her high in the air. She'd spread her wings and pretend to fly, laughing and being happy. I'd listen to Peter sing the line \"Sweetness in the air and justice on the wind\" and it would brace my soul. There were so many tears during those hard years of illness and poverty, but the music brought hope and joy. While to me Peter is inextricably linked to the group Peter, Paul and Mary, I recognize he is an individual with his own singular contributions to the world. On the same note, the trio would not have existed - at least no in the same way or with the same influence - without Peter's willingness to share his voice and talent. And that trio changed hearts and lives and continues to do so to this day. My daughters used to ride in the car as children and sing the Union Medley along with me. Then my children grew up. As a teen, my oldest joined me at a protest as we wore \"Which side are you on\" shirts. Just weeks ago, I looked at photographs with pride of my oldest stood side by side with grocery workers locally to demand the right to unionize. That is impact. Peter, there is so much to say. So many instances in my life and the lives of my children that I could point out, but that would take a book and some of it is just not my story to tell, but please know that a couple of the most beautiful things that remain in my life still remain due to the way your music taught me to view the world and helped me question the intolerance and bigotry that permeated my childhood. Thank you for that. You are loved, you are appreciated and you are forever in the hears of myself and my children. Gina Locke (aka René Moses) As a 17 year old , high school junior in Columbus, Ohio, I was asked to sing in a trio. I have never heard of the group Peter, Paul and Mary. With my 12 string guitar I had just bought in Munich Germany, Bill with his very expensive 6 string and Mark, we tackled your music. Lots of practice and laughter in Bills bedroom . . . his parents were very patient. Sang at church youth gathering across the Central Ohio area. I fell in love with your music, your sound, and your heart. Then Mark left and we picked up Charma. If I remember right, I actually sang Mary's alto parts. Great times. Great music. Great memories. I do recall, one night I was in a deep funk. Started to play \"This Train\" but in a slow, sad tempo. I had never heard the three of you singing it till years later. Wow, was I shocked at the difference. But, I did like my version better. HA. At my age now, many times, I'll go to UTube and play your music. No matter what challenges I face, my heart smiles hearing your voices. Thank you Peter for the joy, the wonderment, the challenges, and the wisdom that has came out of your music. My prayers are with you. May God's peace and understanding go with you always. Ron Myers Hello, dear Peter. It's been nearly 30 years since we last talked but I can still hear your voice as if it was just yesterday. Do you remember when I was working for Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell in Washington D.C.? Senator Campbell had switched parties and I found myself suddenly without a job and you were so kind and helpful as you gave me wise guidance about whether or not I should come home to Colorado and work for a non profit. I followed your advice and stayed in public service and was honored to have had the opportunity to work for the both the Clinton and Obama administrations, retiring finally in 2017. While in DC it was such a privilege to see you and Paul and Mary at Wolf Trap on more than one occasion. I am sorry that we lost touch over the years but know that you are surrounded by love and light. Trudy Kareus As a child in the early 60s, my father often sang “Puff” to me, with accompanying shenanigans from my beloved “Puff” hand puppet. I loved the song and got a warm feeling every time I heard it as I grew up and well into adulthood. At my wedding, my husband chose your Wedding Song for our first dance, which was lovely. And for my dance with my father, I chose Puff the Magic Dragon. Never was I ever so grateful for waterproof mascara. My choice decimated everyone at the reception as well, with nostalgic happy tears. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for such a tender, precious moment. My Dad has since passed, but that will remain one of my most treasured memories with him. I am thinking of you - and all those you love - wishing you freedom from all discomfort and peace. The world so appreciates the precious gift of music and love you gave us. God bless you, Peter. Elizabeth I am 60 years old. I was born and raised in New York, Queens,Kew Gardens to be precise. I was in kindergarten, wearing dog tags for a missing soldier in the Vietnam war. That summer I attended girl scout camp in the Catskills Mountains. Night time fire circles were always my favorite part of camp. We would gather under the night sky and learn and sing songs, mostly spirituals and folk songs. Peter, Paul, and Mary were among my faves! I recently became a Grandmother and just sang PUFF THE MAGIC DRAGON to him for the first time. We have a morning song hour over facetime because we live 12 hours apart from one another. Many if Peter’s sings are being celebrated in those precious hours! ​ - Cherise Barasch Dear Peter, you are a shining star, you are, from near or far. Thank you for your beautiful voice and songwriting that contributed to the revolution of the 60s. And thank you for always continuing your work, performing and promoting causes with messages of hope for a free and healthy planet. I will always remember the historic moment when you joined us with Bethany, Raquel and Ester in ceremony. How WONDERFUL that you all were able to record together, too! But the epic-ness is not what is special about you and your life. You are a FABULOUS FATHER to my beautiful friend, Bethany. You gave her life. And for that I am forever grateful. You should know how much she loves you, Peter. Know what a true warrior Bethany is. Bethany loves you. Valentina loves you. Christopher loves you. Mary Beth loves you. We ALL LOVE YOU. You can feel free. You can feel all of our love surrounding you in an eternal cloud of unconditional love. Your heart vibrates with us. Your songs are eternal and we will sing them together in your memory, rediscovering our own empowerment. Love you so much! Carmel So many things. So many stories. I don't know where to start. When I was growing up (yes, I just broke into song there), you were a light in my world. I know that I was one of many muffins and cupcakes in your world, but you were such a intrinsic part of mine. From the rare concerts we could drive to that always included getting time with the three of you (which, I always skipped out on Noel and Mary because I just had to talk to you again), to the yearly trips to Kerrville, every word you uttered to me impacted my life in ways I cannot begin to tell you about. You always remembered my name. Admittedly, it could be because I shared a name with Mary's daughter, but to me, back then, when I had no friends, it was everything. You became my friend. My family. One year, at Kerrville, you set me loose with Bethany. She had to be a grown up middle schooler back then, braces, big hair, and a cool T-shirt. I spent the entire day following her around like a lost puppy, until she finally managed to lose me. I made my way to the backstage entrance and just stood there, in tears, begging for Peter. When they finally took me to you, you scooped me up, and talked all tears away, then sat me up on stage as Odetta and a couple of others performed, then over to center stage with you and Bethany for what was to me, the main show. In those young years, it was acts like that that really hit home. And I wanted to be just like you. I wanted to live like you do. I wanted to touch people the way you do (not a musical bone in my body, even my hairbrush microphone agrees there, so that didn't work out so well). I wanted to move people's souls the way you do. As I grew, I rebelled, as most kids do. I became an angry teen, and I wanted to hate the world. I wanted to turn my back on everything, and embrace this angst. But there was always this part of me that could hear your voice. Feel your arms holding this child that you barely knew and making her feel like she mattered. Like she had the power to change the world. Slowly, your messages started seeping back through. And that facade I'd worked so hard on started to slip. Suddenly, though I was homeless at the time, I was giving to others who were worse off than I was. I was taking other kids that were also homeless under my wing and trying to guide them. It was a gradual thing. I spent a lot of time torn between two worlds. Two inner selfs. But your memory, your words both to me directly, and those in your music, became louder, and helped me find my way again. When I finally turned 18 and made my way back to Texas, I went back to Kerrville with my mom. And when I found you at the little theater there and talked to you, even after all those years, you remembered me. You saw my face and instantly came to me and hugged me tight. I don't know how you knew it was me. It had been years. I was grown, and I had been maybe 10 the last time you saw me. Maybe you recognized my mom, I do not know. But you knew me. And in that moment, everything clicked into place. I was not torn anymore. I was still that same little girl that wanted the world to be a better place, and wanted to do my small part to make it so. When my dad built and handled your (PP&M) website, I wanted so badly to reach out to you again. But I was afraid. Afraid of disappointing you. I felt like I was not doing enough. Like I was not deserving of the love you had shown me over the years. I know now that wasn't the case. I know that you would have embraced me still, no matter. And that time lost is still among my bigger regrets. But, I've tried since then, in so many ways. I wish I had the wisdom and courage that you have shown me over the years. I fail more often than I succeed. But I keep trying. That, and so much more, in my world, are your memories. Your legacies. You shaped me, as you shaped so many others, with your love, and everything that has come from it. And just the opening notes of almost any of your songs are enough to remind me of you and all that you are. I love you, Peter. I'm grateful that your legacy will never leave me. Carry On.... Alicia Chambers My parents (John Gilbertson and Karin Bakken) went to high school with Mary Beth in Willmar, MN. Mary Beth and my mother were childhood friends and have remained friends since graduating in 1964. I remember my mother telling me about Peter and Mary Beth’s wedding. My mother told me about how Paul wrote “Wedding Song (There Is Love) for your parents wedding. When I got married in 2004, I had that song included in my wedding. My mother was also part of the stained glass window restoration at Calvary Lutheran Church in Willmar, MN. Your father played a role in this project as he assisted in locating and securing the original stained glass windows from the church for restoration. One would be remised if they didn’t include their own childhood memories of hearing Puff the Magic Dragon. When my uncle passed way in August 2000, Puff the Magic Dragon was played at his funeral. That song brought comfort to our family during our time of sorrow. ​ - Kirstin Gilbertson Howell Dear Mr. Peter Yarrow, I hope you feel fine and peace this moment as you see this message! I am Josephine Choi, a retired primary school principal in Hong Kong. I knew and loved your songs and had seen you in the early years in the 20th century in Hong Kong. You, Paul and Mary were good singing partners and had come to visit Hong Kong one year.( Sorry I forgot which year!)I remembered that three of you sang your songs together to encourage us. One program called “Don’t laugh at me” had launched in that year. I had joined the program and learned how to help those in need and created some activities to enhance the skill of the weak students to prevent bullying. This was a very good program held and promoted by you and your team! Thank you so much for your love to Hong Kong students! We love you and hope you feel ease and strong in your heart! May God’s grace and blessings be with you today and forever! Love and thank from Hong Kong , Principal Josephine YY Choi Peter, I am beyond blessed to have worked for you but most importantly to have been a part of the extended PPM family. I will never get over how I immediately felt loved and a part of the group. It was as if I had known you all my life. You give the BEST hugs! When setting up in the lobby I would hear you setting up the sound with Dave - counting 1, 2, 3, 4. I would hear it in my sleep LOL. There are so many road trip stories and I cherish them all. Thank you for all the love, peace and joy you have shared to me, my family and the world. You are forever in my heart. Renee My parents raised me up on PP&M. My dad took me to my first ever concert with my best friend, Gina in 1960 something. Selland Arena in Fresno CA. We joined in “the answer my friend is blowin’ in the wind. . . Peter Yarrow, my all time #1songwriter, folk hero. His music carried me thru teen-dom and onward as a young mother. I too, raised my 5 babies up singing Puff, Weave Me the Sunshine and Light One Candle. Up loud! I took my 12 year old daughter to her first concert in 1993 at the Spokane Opera House. We clapped, we sang, we cried. She raised up her 4 children with the same love. Rocking her baby, singing The Garden Song, inch by inch, row by row. . . Someone did indeed bless the seeds we’ve sown. Our beloved Papa Dragon may sail on but in his own words “Lives by the sea. Present tense.” ​ - Cathy Larson I loved the Puff The Magic Dragon. I wanted to be a singer but was too shy to ever sing for anyone. In the 6th grade, there was going to be a talent show at school. I was determined to be in it and sing \"Puff The Magic Dragon\". Because I had a little bit of art talent, I was chosen, along with a really pretty girl, to work on an art project out in the hall. Somehow we started talking about the upcoming talent show. I told her I was going to sing it in. \"Really\" she responded. I said yea... \"Puff The Magic Dragon\"...thinking she would be so impressed...she looked me dead in the eyes and said...\"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard\". Although now I laugh about it, at that moment I was crushed. I did not sing in the talent show... or anywhere else for years. But I eventually did, doing many Peter Paul and Mary songs. In fact, while loving to sing \"Puff\", I've probably done \"The Wedding Song\" more than Paul. Thank you Peter for the music. With great love in my heart, I can say your music had a wonderful effect on my life. You have been a gift to the world. God bless you. ​ - Sam Grant Peter, if I may be so bold as to use his first name, has been a part of most of my life. As part of Peter, Paul and Mary, his songs drew me to an awareness of social issues of the day. His music has inspired me, and I have inspired others with his music. I have used his music in prayer and in prayer services with groups. I truly believe his life has inspired me and made me a better person. Peter's music has stayed powerful, relevant and joyful - because there's always hope. Peter, continue the journey, singing always and be at peace. ​ - Jeannette List Shortly after the lovely Puff the Magic Dragon book came out Peter was scheduled to be at The Tattered Cover in Denver. I was working in London at the time and flew home to his appearance. Lovely stories and music and then the book signing. We'd been alerted that he wouldn't personalize the books, it takes so much time and there was a large crowd. When I got to the head of the line Peter took the books and started signing them. I mentioned I'd flown in from London for the event. So graciously he got up from the table, hugged me, and thanked me for coming. I thank him and the wonderful group for all the songs and the inspiration to be better. ​ - Christine Jensen Several years ago, my wife and I had the honor of seeing Peter perform in a small venue in New Hampshire. He was so warm and giving in his performance, and at intermission when we got to speak to him he greeted us not with a hello, or even a handshake, but with a warm hug. The man exuded love. After intermission, when Peter returned to the stage, he found he’d forgotten his guitar pick in his jacket in the dressing room. I always have a pick in my jeans pocket and as I was in about the third row, I walked up and gave Peter my pick. He smiled, thanked me and￼ said it was a nice pick and would do nicely. He played the whole rest of the show with that pick and last I saw it was tucked between the strings of his guitar. What an honor for me from a man who helped teach me to love folk music, and unknowingly taught me to sing harmony. I’ve had the pleasure of seeing Peter one more time since, with Noel. Both concerts warmed my heart and brought happy tears. What a gift Peter Yarrow is to us all. All positive thoughts and prayers to him and to your family. ​ - Fred Giuffrida I first saw Peter, Paul & Mary in Fort Worth in 1966, then in Dallas in 1968, in Kansas City in 1970, again in Fort Worth in the late 1980s. I saw and talked with Peter many times at the Kerrville Music Festival through the years. We were honored to have Peter perform at the Winnsboro Center for the Arts (Winnsboro, Texas) a few years ago for two nights and again a year later. When he discovered we were singer-songwriters, he invited us up the second night and asked if we would sing “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “If I Had a Hammer” and sing a couple of verses. He changed our little town in ways no one else could, greeting people wherever he went and spreading joy and love. We wish him a smooth transition from a live lived well. ​ - Lindy Hearne I have a memory of who I somehow believe was your Dad singing Puff The Magic Dragon to me and my older Brother, in our house on top of the mountain, when we were tiny tots. I also remember monkey puppets being gifted to us, as I recall, by the singer guitar player. Not sure how your Dad was somehow singing to us in our home, but at that time, my Woodstock Visual Artist Mom was running a small in home day care and she also was in real estate. It was Woodstock back in the day. Well, we were up on Glenford. Perhaps our parents knew one another. Anyways, both the singer guitar player and the song Puff The Magic Dragon, and the monkey puppets, were a HUGE DEAL to me in my childhood and I will always remember this song and those monkey puppets! I also have sung this song to other Children who love this song as well! Funny, cuz in Chinese astrology I am mentally a monkey, emotionally a dragon, and physically a snake. Prayers in the Holy Spirit for your Influential Pops! El Shaddai Jehovah Rapha Refuah Shlema Yehoshua HaMessiach Ruach HaKodesh Ministering Angels God’s People Hear Here Thank You Praise You Hallelujah Amen Once upon a time our parents brought us to see Peter Paul and Mary play at the Circle Star Theater in Redwood City, CA. I was about 3 years old and completely in awe through the whole experience. At the end we stood crowded around, patiently waiting for autographs. When it came to our turn Peter looked at my parents and asked to hold me. Transferring me to his welcome arms Peter went on to tell them that he missed his own daughter and that I reminded him of her. My parents said he held me for quite a long time as he signed autographs of others. I’m not sure what happened to that autographed program but I do know I looked at it many times over the years when I was small, trying to find the resemblance. Years later I was able to bring my own two children to see Peter read his Puff the Magic Dragon book at the Reading Bug Bookstore in San Carlos, CA. It was somewhat of a full circle moment as my son was about the same age I had been. Happy memories I will always cherish. ​ - Rachelle Kenny My daughter and I traveled with Peter and his group in 2008 to Vietnam. It was an amazing trip. Peter gave three concerts in support of victims still suffering from exposure to Agent Orange after all these years after the War in Vietnam. We went out into the countryside and saw two young children who had been born with disabilities due to the fact that Agent Orange is still in the soil and water. My daughter, 15 at the time, was very moved by these two children. One other special time on that trip was when we met with former members of the Viet Cong now serving in civic posts and Peter led us in a song. It could have been \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\" But I am not sure. We saw Peter close up as a man devoted to helping those in need and he gave my daughter and I an experience that we will never forget. Our love goes out to him and to you as well. ​ - Susan Bardfield I first met Peter in a business setting. He was looking for someone to repair and refinish the hardwood floors in his apartment. All of the companies he reached out to for estimates told him the floors could not be salvaged. Peter would not take that for an answer, and finally reached out to my company which is now called REA Wood Floor Restoration. I personally met with him, and from the time he met me at the door, I had a great feeling about him. He was the nicest and most down to Earth person I had ever met in my 25 years if doing work in Manhattan. It was like meeting with an old friend...this was only 30 minutes into the meeting. Very cordial, very welcoming. It was one of the most memorable meetings I've ever experienced. Well, we talked about a bit of everything, and then we talked business. I told him that we could find the flooring to replace the damaged boards, and then refinish and stain the floors. The logistics were challenging because there was a lot of furniture and we would have to do the work in stages. He loved the idea, and he hired us. Peter and I worked closely together to mix several different stain colors to get the desired look...he is truly an artist with a great eye. The project was challenging, but we ended up with great looking floors. Peter was very greatful and happy with the end result. The best thing that happened thru all of this, is that Peter and I became friends. During the project; and even after it was completed, Peter would invite me to have lunch with him..either just talking and eating in his kitchen, or actually going to his favorite Chinese restaurant. The talks we had about social justice, music, and just about everything he cared about was awe inspiring to me. His empathy and compassion was second to none. He inspired me to care about social justice and change, in a way I never thought possible. I can honestly say that if I am considered an activist today, it is because of Peter Yarrow. He would always call me his brother, and I considered him mine. He would talk to my 12 year old daughter on the phone sometimes, and gifted her Puff books and other memorabilia...something she loved. As I reminisce about Peter, I sometimes think and wonder...did the world deserve Peter Yarrow? I'm sure it needed him. ​ - Reggie Alston I have such fond memories of Peter from my childhood. His son Christopher was a classmate and friend of mine during our years at P.S. 6 in Manhattan. His talent and social and political advocacy were always to be admired. That said: I remember most fondly his kindness and compassion. I was one of those children who experienced chronic abuse and harassment from members of my peer group, largely due to the perception of my sexual orientation. Peter Yarrow demonstrated early in my life that men were not required to adhere to stereotypical norms of “masculinity.” Men could be kind, gentle, affectionate, inclusive and creative. Operation Respect is yet another example of his commitment to social justice and one for which I hold tremendous respect. Peter is, as one might say, “the real deal.” I send my love and support to his children Christopher and Bethany and his family, friends and fans. Peter Campbell (Lichter), Toronto, Canada. Mon cher Pierre, mon cher dragon, This message is full of love, hugs and hygge to you from Denmark! What a privilege it was to have served on the OR board for over a decade! Even before then your music was in my life so your words, tunes and melodies have always been there. And greetings too my my father, Ray, who stayed with you on a business visit he had in NYC. He remembers staying up and chatting with you. I thank you for your hospitality and opening your home to him. Plus your song to him for his 70th birthday was unforgettable! And your songs to my colleagues when I worked at the Development Gateway Foundation was memorable and a unique treat!! I adore you from afar and send you lots of love and knus!! Bissous mon ami, from the other Charlotte!!! I grew up listening to your dad-Peter- alongside Paul and Mary as many children of the 70s did. My dad always used to sing Puff the Magic Dragon to me.. it wasn't until my late teens when I left home that I finally started to understand the true meanings of the song. I was lucky enough to have met Peter and Mary backstage at their \"Lifelines\" concert in Connecticut where I gave them a hand-made rainbow quilt and told them just how much their music- as well as their social activisim and ethics had influenced my young adult life. Over the years I have seen and heard Peter sing many times and each affected me deeply and profoundly for different reasons. Your light will continue to radiate down the generations for this very reason- the amazing example you set forth all your life. Of fighting for peace, justice, and those less fortunate. Of speaking out- peacefully but with great clarity- against injustice in whatever form it presented. Fighting for equality. For harmony. For love. In that spirit this is what I send.. love. Strength. Courage. Peace. and Magic.. always Magic! ​ - Cassy Pelkey Peter, Paul, and Mary have been part of my life since I was very small. What makes this unusual is that I am profoundly deaf (since birth) but can hear with my hearing aids. I listened to their songs at full blast with the lyrics in my hands. I would sing them too (off tune, of course) but the beautiful voices of PPM resonated (and still do) with me. Thank you for enriching my childhood and my life with your amazing songs. I remember watching a PBS special years ago and Peter telling the story of how he wrote “Light One Candle”. We sing this song every year at Hanukkah in my house and in temple. Long after the dragon has ceased to breathe fire, his voice will still be singing the songs for years to come. Thank you, Peter, for enhancing my life with your songs and your soulful voice. Even though Little Jackie Paper comes no more, there are still millions who believe in Puff the Magic Dragon and we will always remember the mightiest ones of them all, Peter, Paul, and Mary. Sail away to frolic in the autumn mist in peace in the land of Honah Lee, dear Peter. You will never be forgotten. ​ - Laurie Heeger-Averitt I feel like we are old friends. In the mid-'60s, in Lincoln, NE, I saw Peter, Paul and Mary at a concert here and was enthralled with it. I sang the songs; I wanted hair like Mary's (and it still is ...). I wanted to play a guitar and harmonize and what I really wanted was to release my own quiet Self, someone caring and who would do as you all did ... stand for 'right'. And I learned ... and learned more. About ten years ago, as I was chatting with a healthcare provider at an appointment, she looked at me and said, \"You're an activist, aren't you.\" I had never felt it 'showed', and grew warm with that thought and moniker. I knew then, the things I learned from the music, the gentle spirit of Peter, and more ... had grown in me as well. To this day, no matter what, when I need a lift, or need to help others with that same spirit, I still give them the URL for the two fractivist videos that Peter filmed, with Bethany and others, in his home, inviting us all in with him. I hear that voice, the music, the urging to stand and sing and link arms, and I begin to calm in that strength. It matters. Always. This storm, even for dragons, will pass, and no matter what is beyond, know that you, Peter, will always be a part of me, because I will still have the music, the caring, urging voice to do 'right' and to carry on. Peace to you and to your family ... and always, love. It's what we've learned from you, like an old and very special friend. <3 (( )) ​ - Linell Connolly I am a retired Black woman lawyer born in Oakland, CA in 1957. I grew up with you, singing along. Music healed my troubled childhood, filled with violence and severe poverty. I felt sorry for Puff and hammered in the morning. As a young adult, my friends married to the \"Wedding Song\" and I traveled widely always with \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\" echoing across the miles. Although I merely enjoying PP&M songs as a child, as an adult I had a better appreciation of your continuing activism in the midst of war and civil upset in the world. As the post 9/11 world became more distorted, I purchased Songs of Conscience & Concern. I needed that music so badly. I shared \"All mixed up\" and \"Don't Laugh at Me\" with my childhood friend and his teacher daughter so he could take his guitar and share it with the 4th graders in her class. The CD played in my home and car providing solace as the world grew darker. I reminded everyone about the songs and the many means of protest. But by 2015, I realized that the nation was in trouble greater than in 2001. Your voice will remain in my ears, your songs in my heart as I navigate my way through these difficult times. leaving on a jet plane without knowing when I'll be back again. ​ - Bernadette Janet My sister, Marge just recently sent you a glorious note about the impact you and your music had on her. I was on the tail end of that same family, introduced to your music through those elder siblings, and it created such a bond between us that lasts to this very day, and as she said, belting out your songs is one of our favorite heart unifying moments of all time. I, too, have passed on to my children (now in their 20s) many of your songs. If there is one image from my childhood that brings Comfort and Joy it is the cover of your TEN YEARS TOGETHER album. It is for me an icon that absorbs me into so much welcomed nostalgia. Praying for your peace and well-being. GRATEFUL beyond words to have been on the receiving end of your generosity with wonderful talent fit for a special time and age! BLESSINGS and peace be with your spirit! ​ - Patricia Feder in 1964, I was just awakening to the world of music, other than the Irish folksongs and songs written by my beloved Great Uncle, Walter Donaldson. Our house was always singing, and I guess it was that that started me in the world of music...one day I heard a different song on the radio, sung by three young people in sort of a slow, haunting way, that talked about sadness, and war, and answers to unanswerable questions; it absolutely floored me; the beauty of the singing, the weight of the lyrics, the fact that it made me feel. And think. The song, of course, was \"Blowing In The Wind\", by Bob Dylan, and the trio, of course, was Peter, Paul and Mary. From that day on I was awash in the Folk world; I had all the albums, the songbooks, knew most of the songs by heart, begged for a guitar until Santa left a beautiful little Yamaha classical guitar under the tree on Christmas morning. I followed them, uncontrollably; I think I was madly in love with the beautiful Mary...as I learned more about music and guitar playing I came to understand that Peter and Noel were brilliant musicians, as well as humanists, activists, and social movers and shakers in the quietest and most enduring of ways. I saw them live (and sang from the crowd, of course), at the March on Washington. I saw them live in concert somewhere in the city, I followed them in magazines and on TV...and I sang the songs...with them, for them. I only met Peter once, personally, in a \"meet-and-greet' after the concert in the city. I last saw him at a blessedly wonderful concert in Morristown, New Jersey, sponsored by our wonderful local Folk Music group, The Folk Project; I was amazed at his strength and connection then, and sang with him once more. I'm still performing, singing the songs, and will do so until I no longer am able; the catalog is mind-boggling; \"Day Is Done\", \"Light One Candle\", \"Don't Laugh At Me\", and of course the songs from the beginning, if I squint too hard when I sing them I can see Peter and Noel leaning in over their guitars toward the mic, and see Mary's hair alight as she tosses it in the spotlights...I just recently watched the PBS Holiday Concert 1988; tears streaming down my face the entire time. I never had a chance to actually thank him for it all; for the good they did, for the hearts they awoke, (including mine), for the spirits they kindled...and for the wrongs they made right. But I know someday I will. And, for now, I will do what I can to follow... ​ - Robert (Bob) Cole It’s 1968. Three high school juniors and a sophomore. Two boys and two girls. Girls could sing and boys could play guitars. We formed a folk group to keep up with the times and turmoil of the world around us. We turned to Peter,Paul and Mary for our inspiration. No better models for our music and message. We also added some Crosby, Stills, and Nash. Did our singing at Catholic youth gatherings and for social events at our church. We all knew each other from grammar school. Your music, your story telling, your sound was so mesmerizing and distinctive. Thank you for being such a memorable part of my teen years. The memory I have of you in song will never fade away. Puff and that Jet Plane. Thank you. Godspeed and know that all dragons go to Heaven. ​ - Donna Stec Peter, you dear man, I wish you peace and love to help you and your family though this difficult time. My heart, along with millions of others, is breaking at the prospect of losing a man of such conviction, humility and wisdom. You've helped shape the lives of generations - worldwide. I can never thank you enough for the joy and understanding you've brought to me personally, and my grown children. You allowed us to get on stage with you, when you were here in Homer, NY a few years ago...it was a dream come true for which I will be eternally grateful. It was an honor to share the stage with our beloved Strong Dragon, to sing along to your PUFF THE MAGIC DRAGON. You'll forever be in our hearts. Puff will live on, and a soul as kind as yours is eternal. I hope to meet you again someday, on the other side of this existence. You are greatly loved and will be missed. ​ - Caroll Tracy Dear Peter, I have always loved your music over the years, but it has become even more meaningful to me in my later years. I was thrilled to see you and Bethany perform last December at Cafe Lena Saratoga. I also sent the live access to my brother and his wife so they could see your performance as well! Also, big fans of your amazing talent! You were fabulous and we so enjoyed your stories as well as your songs! It meant so much to meet you after the show and give you our thanks for all the years of sharing your incredible talent with the world!!! You are truly a blessing to humanity and your legacy will be treasured for eternity We are all sending you healing prayers that all of our love that surrounds you will free you from pain and will fill you with joy in knowing that you have touched the hearts of millions of people throughout the world I will be buying your children’s books to share this Christmas with all the children I know and donate as well to a Grassroots Reading Program for children in Albany, NY. With Sincere Gratitude and Blessings to you, Joanne Richards Every moment in life, I believe, is orchestrated by God. Your life was woven into the tapestry of mine & all the others who were touched by the gift of music you so freely shared, music that uplifted, spoke to the realities of life & shaped parts of our character that we never realized. It was about what God wanted to do through the life of Peter Yarrow & you were obedient to share your gifts. Thank you for all you have given, even this opportunity to bless & pray for you. Sent with much love & many prayers from a Canadian girl. ​ - Michele Collins Words fail in my attempt to encapsulate what your life journey has meant in my life journey. You have braced our planet with the vibration of love and peace since being a young man. How many times have I listened to the albums that you and your dear Paul and Mary created And then, when you could’ve retired, you chose to come to Utah and support a fledgling activist organization Dedicated to waving the flag of climate justice. Perhaps you’ll be able to recognize the impact you have made once you transition. I look forward to the day that I transition because I believe that we go to an Existence with no strife or struggle. I believe that love is all there is and you have personified that your entire life. If the world could model Your message, what a wonderful world it would be! I will always treasure the memory of my encounters with you & look forward to the day when our spirits encounter each other in a different world. Your involvement with Peaceful Uprising was just one of countless examples of how you impacted our world And rest assured, there are countless humans that will always hold your memory in our hearts. Thank God for you! And thank you for sharing the God in you. Rest easy, my friend you go on a cloud of intense love from this planet! ​ - Julianne Waters don't know Peter Yarrow the man, but his music has been pretty much the soundtrack of my life. One of my earliest memories is singing \"If I Had a Hammer\" with my big sister in our backyard. In high school, I pretty much knew every PP&M song and sang them often and harmonized with my guitar-playing friends. When I met my husband, one thing we had in common was our love for PP&M. I remember listening to them singing \"We Shall Overcome\" one beautiful evening at Wolf Trap and thinking that, at that moment, all was right with the world. On the day of Bill Clinton's inauguration, my husband and my young son and I were walking down the street in DC and heard a group singing PP&M songs up ahead. We got closer and it was actually them! Standing on a street corner singing and celebrating with everyone else! I've seen them numerous other times too and most recently had tickets to see them in Keene, NH a few weeks ago which, sadly, was cancelled. I'm so sorry to read of Peter's illness. But thank you for the beautiful music that has enriched so many people's lives and will continue to do so long into the future. - Sally Caltrider Dear Peter, I wanted to send you a message to let you know how much the music of Peter, Paul, and Mary has always meant to me. I got to meet you one time in 2010 at LaGuardia Airport. My wife and I were in NYC for our 20th anniversary. We did a lot of touristy things, but the highlight of my trip was seeing you. I spotted you from the back as you were in line at a restaurant. I told my wife that Peter Yarrow was in line to get food but she thought I was pulling her leg. The previous day, I had told her I saw Dick Gregory in Times Square, but it was just an older Black man who bore a passing resemblance to him. But you sat down one table over from us, and then we knew it was you. I was too star-struck to say anything to you so I wrote you a note and waited for you to finish your meal and gave you the note. You read the note and bowed toward me and blew a kiss to my wife and waved to both of us, as you went off to your gate. Everyone in my family (including uncles and all the cousins) has heard me tell that story, because I thought it was so cool to meet Peter Yarrow! The music of Peter, Paul, and Mary will live forever. And it is a blessing to all of those who have ever heard it and will be hearing it in the years to come. Peace be with you. Sincerely, Gregory Hicks Dear Peter, Meeting you put me absolutely on Cloud Nine. It was ten years ago; I was running for Congress and a mutual friend said that you were always looking for progressive candidates to support. Did I want to meet you? Did I?! We shared some magical hours in your wonderful Manhattan home and I floated out of there in disbelief at my good fortune. I fervently wished my mother had been alive to hear about it. A peacenik from forever, she’d introduced us kids to Peter, Paul and Mary starting with your first album, and we learned every song. In fact, more than 60 years later, I still remember playing “Blowin’ in the Wind” over and over again, studying the words with my twin sister and our friend Jeanie Hansen. A light bulb went off as it dawned on us what “metaphor” was: “How many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?” Oh, that’s about civil rights, isn’t it?! And “How many years must a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea?” is about injustice, right?! It was a revelation. As you always say, music has the power to change hearts and minds, and yours did just that. But back to just ten years ago: You came to Ithaca for an incredible fundraiser that was the highlight of my campaign. I hate to keep using the word “magical” but that’s what it was. Even more than a fierce political ally, you became a dear friend. I treasured our visits and phone calls, especially the weekend at the Waterfall House (with warmest thanks to Bethany!). Peter, the power of your voice will never be dimmed. The force of your example – to keep fighting for justice and peace – will live on in whatever good works we who follow you can accomplish. The joy of your love is the ultimate gift that keeps on giving. With all my heart, I wish you peace and comfort on the road ahead. Martha Robertson Dear Peter, I suppose much of what I want to say cannot be said or it's been said better by so many others. I stand with so many whose lives you have touched but have never actually met. Your songs resonated deeply within me from my time as a young girl,when puff is a magic dragon and I'd run around the house singing it. But with great fervor I picked up other songs. And yes, some concerts and yes what we lovingly call the b-side songs are probably more my favorites. Okay, I watched as you and Mary and Noel lived a faith and commitment that I wanted to have too. To sing for those who had no voice. To speak truth to power. To listen to people's stories and share them with others. That justice may be done and all God's people, yes, all God's people, can live together as one family. So thank you. For so much. As youmake your way home, you know Mary is waiting to greet you and so many others of your friends. This time of transition I pray be smooth and as painless as God will allow it. Well done good and faithful servant. Well done my brother. Well done my mentor I have yet to meet. May the Angels welcome you to Paradise. May the martyrs come to escort you to the holy city. The new and eternal Jerusalem. ​ - Mary Dumm A snippet from my memoir, \"Surrender: My Journey from Guerrilla to Grandmother.\" I was happy to be able to talk with Peter about how important this song was to me as I tried to make my way in the complicated world of activism against the Vietnam War. The summer after I finished high school, Dick (my older brother) was only a year from graduating college and having to decide where his life was headed. He had bought Peter Paul and Mary’s Mandala album. Together we listened over and over to the title song, a ballad of the imprisonment, hunger strike, and eventual death of a war resister. Tell the people they are safe now Hunger stopped him, he lies still in his cell. Death has silenced his accusations We are free now, we can kill now We can hate now, now we can end the world We're not guilty, he was crazy And it's been going on for ten thousand years. Take your place on The Great Mandala As it moves through your brief moment of time. Win or lose now you must choose now And if you lose you’ve only wasted your life. It became another song that I sang with all my heart. I lived with stories of martyrs who suffered and died for their beliefs. I lived with righteous confidence in my vision of a God-ordained right and wrong and with the necessity of confidently pursuing the right, even unto death. ​ - Katherine Power 57 years ago I spent more or less every Saturday night in my college dorm room, in the dark, listening to ALBUM 1700. The casual reference to \"How's the preacher? How's Don? Did he go back to school? No kidding I thought he was gay!\" blew my mind -- I thought I had the worst secret in the world, and here it was referred to as no big deal -- and the MAIN song on this astonishing album, THE GREAT MANDELLA, written by Peter, was the theme of the whole year as I waited to find out my draft lottery number and agonized, as everybody did, over the Vietnam War. So then to MEET Peter so much later in life, and become friends, and get to experience his incredible sweet, gentle, wise, so-deeply-caring self close up . . . it's been a gift and an honor and a pleasure. Hats off to you, Peter! And thanks! ​ - Andrew Tobias Tribute to Peter… I came to know Peter during my 37-year tenure at ASCAP although, like so many others, I grew up with the music of Peter, Paul and Mary and had been a great admirer of their music and activism way before. Getting to know Peter has been a very special experience. Apart from being a gifted songwriter and performer and member of, arguably, the most famous trio in the music business, Peter has always been the real deal. He walks the walk, consistently trying to move the needle, help people in every way possible and make a difference by doing everything he can to make this world a better place. He would often call upon me to do some small thing to help with one of his ambitious initiatives… and I always tried to come through for him because his sincerity and passion were contagious. He has constantly been at work trying to bring joy to the lives of others… and his personal magnetism and commitment compelled you to join his efforts. And despite his myriad accomplishments, he has never displayed any kind of superiority…. but has always been simple, straightforward. He is a star in so many ways… but he has never behaved like one. And if he had a hint of his own celebrity, it was only used to help others… to obtain “ungetable” tickets for a young cancer patient to achieve her dream of attending a Taylor Swift concert…. to help further the career of young artists who needed his help… the list is endless as is Peter’s capacity for empathy and action. And Peter has always been so self-effacing that I can’t be sure if he realized how many are still mesmerized by his music and his performances. I recently attended several shows he did (solo and with Noel/Paul) at the Katherine Hepburn Performing Arts Center in Old Saybrook, CT near where I currently reside. At each show, he received a standing ovation many times during the performance and the audiences were swept away by his his music, his magic and his humanity. When I visited with him backstage afterwards, he only wanted to hear about me… my projects and my life. And he has always been so proud of Bethany… of her talent and her commitment. I have many fond memories of her sitting in my office at ASCAP with Peter, serenading me with a new song she wrote. I feel so lucky to be a part of Peter’s circle; I continue to cherish his friendship, his joie de vivre and his unstoppable excitement about all his causes and all the people he has taken under his very large wings. Dearest Peter…. Please get well: we cannot do without you! Love, Karen Sherry PP&M were the first Folk Group that I embraced as ayou g girl and over the years I attended many concerts at The College of William and Mary ( my Alma Mater), in Richmond, Norfolk, Charlottesville, during a blinding snowstorm, and in Northern Virginia. Following their Peaceful protests and singing , “If I had a Hammer”, “ Blowin’’ in the Wind”, and “ We shall overcome” I had hope that we could all someday live in Peace. My friends, the Bakers, came to know Peter, Paul and especially, Mary, as fans and then close friends, and I treasure a pair of Mary’s pearl earrings gifted to me. My children grew up singing “Puff, the Magic Dragon” and we cherished every album the group made… especially the Christmas In Concert albums. My late daughter and I visited personally, backstage with Peter, Noel, and Mary at Wolf Trap. She wrote often to NOEL and kept up with him and Peter after Mary’s passing. I especially loved, “Don’t Let the Lights Go Out” that Peter wrote, and as a musician offered a rendition to my Jewish friends at Hanukkah for many years. Peter’s light will never dim, and, just like Mary, he lives forever and Noel will ne with them one day when they sing and play together again. I am now at the Twilight of my years too and I wish Peace and love, Peter. Thank you for all you gave us . ​ - Terry Arnold I'm a second-generation Peter, Paul & Mary fan. My parents played their music during my childhood, and since college I've seen them perform several times at Wolf Trap (VA), the north shore of Boston, and several times in Manhattan when I moved there. I saw Peter perform at the Eldridge Street synagogue, and I saw him and Noel Paul at Symphony Space. But my favorite Peter Yarrow memory is when I ran into him in Chelsea late one Monday night! I believe he had just come from a PBS taping (he was wheeling his guitar behind him), and I had just come from an improv show. I recognized him, and even though - as a New Yorker - I would normally never approach a celebrity, I decided I couldn't let this moment pass. So I went up and introduced myself, and he was so gracious and delightful. Truly one of my favorite NYC memories, from 11 years of living there. He's a living legend, and the music and story and work of PP&M means so much to me. I continue to play their music for my own boys (3rd generation listeners)! I'll be playing \"Weave Me the Sunshine\" now, and remembering the happy sing-alongs at Wolf Trap, and playing \"Light One Candle\" and thinking of his example in activism and social justice and non-violent resistence. Thank you for the music, Peter, and thank you for the example you've set. ​ - Kristy Wesolowski At one of the trio’s events in Minneapolis, the family seated behind us had a severely handicapped daughter, probably in her early teens. As we waited for the show to begin, her feet were on the back of my seat and she frequently kicked me in the back of my head. Her parents did the best they could to keep her calm through the beginning of the show. And then some magic happened! You sang Puff and she settled right down and “sang” along with you! They left shortly after that. What wonderful parents they were to bring her to see the folks who created that beautiful dragon! I have attended several of your concerts but I believe that was my favorite because I saw Puff through the eyes of that child. Know that you will always be loved in my home! Sue Hilliard, Two Harbors, Minnesota For Peter Yarrow Like so many of my generation - of many generations - Peter's music has been part of the soundtrack of my life. I heard the trio sing \"Day in Done\" in a concert in Madison in 1969 and then heard the trio the next week at the big anti-war march in DC. It became a go-to song for me to sing to my kids. And there are personal moments as well. When my wife and I heard him sing \"With Your Fade to the Wind (Harriet's Song)\" at a concert in Madison WI, we knew it would be an important song for a friend who was an avid cyclist and who was dying of cancer. But it was not yet on an album, We reached out to Peter and he sent a us a cassette tape (remember those?) recorded in his apartment and later we played it at our friend's funeral. The words he wrote then fit him now - \"Yes, there are hands here to comfort you / And if you need there are tears to cry with you too.\" I had the pleasure of meeting him a few times over the years. A gentle sprit, a committed activist, a catalyst for change and an amazing musician. He is always a blessing to our world. Phil Haslanger, Madison Wis. It was 1964, I was almost 6 years old, and I had my face held close to my parents' black and white television screen watching Peter, Paul and Mary perform their music. I was transfixed. The next day, I was strumming my father's baritone ukulele pretending to be them and pretending to play “Puff, the Magic Dragon.” Later, in sixth grade, my teacher would bring her guitar into class and play us Peter, Paul and Mary songs for us. That Christmas, I was gifted a guitar, and I never looked back. Those musical icons of our youth often seemed so untouchable, superhuman in many respects. I never thought I would cross paths with them. Fast forward to July of 2023. I had the fortune of getting to know Noel through my music and my move to Maine. Noel and Peter were performing a concert in Waterville, ME, and my wife and I got tickets. It was a treat to be invited backstage after the concert to see Noel and meet Peter. I have found that a portion of musicians of Noel's and Peter's stature can be unapproachable. That was not the case here. I knew Noel was fantastic and very down-to-earth, but I had never met Peter. Well, there was Peter sitting on a chair in front of me telling stories. When I introduced myself to him, he looked me in the eyes, grinned, stood up, and gave me a great big hug like we were long-lost friends. In a way, we were because I knew him for most of my life through his music. I left the Waterville Opera House that night with a full heart because Peter and Noel, two of my idols, had both turned out to be the exemplary, gracious human beings in person that I had hoped them to be in my mind since watching their black and white images on that television from my youth. Lots of love to you, Peter, and thank you for the inspiration and the memories. ​ - Gordon Ward Dear Bethany and Christopher, I live in Blue Hill, Maine and have grown close to Noel and Betty over these many years, so I feel a special connection to Peter having heard so many stories. Having grown up in NYC in the 50s/60s, any card carrying lefty followed the emergence of PP&M. Who wouldn't love them?! All of us learned to play our nylon stringed Goyas to their first album, learning all those songs note by note until we could play them all. I moved to Cincinnati for my college years. The trio came to town and performed. After the concert, Peter, guitar in hand and a group of us decamped to a friends' home. Peter, ever the troubadour, held court telling stories, punctuating them with song until the wee hours. I remember that night as one of the most wonderful of my young life.. The memory has never faded. When I moved to Blue Hill, The circle was closed meeting Noel as I did. But that night with your Dad will forever remain as a highlight. I will remember that night forever, along with Stewball, Puff and their many friends, all present that long ago night. Thanks to your father for the good times, the lessons learned and all that inspiration... Kind regards, David Caplan My mom and I loved Peter, Paul, and Mary and after she died in 2003, I found myself listening to them every year on her birthday. I created a special and very unique playlist one year and burned a CD. I listened to that play list for months every day on the way to and from school, where I taught music. While I listened I often cried, a good deep cathartic cry. That May, I spontaneously went camping at Spring Gulch, the campground I visited with my family every summer growing up. They had a folk festival, and on a whim, I attended. Of course I listed to that CD the whole way there. While I rode my bike around the campground, feeling closer to my mom than I had in years, suddenly I heard a familiar voice and a familiar song. I walked over to the main stage, and I was stunned to find Peter Yarrow and his son performing- I had never even looked at the lineup. They played that CD playlist almost verbatim... and I soaked in every beautiful minute. I was so honored to have my photo taken afterwards with them, while blissfully in total shock that somehow, that completely unique CD brought my mother and Peter together in a way I never imagined. It was beautiful. A few years later, I met Peter again at another concert and sang Puff on stage with a group of people. One more time a few years after that, I purchased a meet and greet and had the opportunity to discuss compassionate education with Peter. He made me feel seen and heard and understood- and validated the work I do at a beautiful nonprofit as their Director of Education. He gave me his email address that night, and since then he has kindly written back every time I've reached out to him- each time with a personal, sincere, loving message. I am so honored to have met you, Peter. Thank you for bringing together generations of people through love, compassion, and drive for change. - Sarah Thornton My daughter's play school teacher was so surprised when a 2-year-old could sing along to every word of Puff. It's no surprise at all given that it's been a nightly lullaby for all her life - for her, for her little sister, for our foster grandkids, and for every other little kid that I've ever rocked to sleep. My PP&M albums were some of my closest friends as an only child in the 80s, and I had many an unsent letter asking for advice as I navigated my early teenage years. My first boyfriend was on the wrestling team, and the New Paltz High School wrestling team rocked out to 10 Years Together for more than one gym workout. Peter, you and Mary and Noel have been a huge part of my life and I know that I'm not alone. Thank you for everything. I am forever grateful for the music, laughter, and tears that have carried me through and always will. ​ - Anne Simons I met Peter at a benefit that my late brother and his wife paid for to raise money for their school. I asked Peter if he had room for yet another benefit concert. He asked about my special needs program, and gave me the number of his staff to arrange it. The first concert was Peter alone. He and I agreed that he would not be expected to 'do this benefit' each year, I had no intention of that. So for the second year, a well known singer songwriter, close friend of Peter's, had led me to believe we were on for the second concert; but that fell through close to the concert date. Peter called and told me to hold on, he was calling Sue Leventhal of (then called) World Hunger Year. \"Who can we get, I'll perform again, but let's find someone to split the bill\"......Sue thought, and within 3 minutes she gathered some names, the first was \"Tom Chapin\" and Peter said, 'that's it, call Tom and hook him up with me, we'll work this our, tell him Barry is a joy to work with\"......It was Tom, his daughters who were starting the Chapin Sisters, Peter, and Phil Namanworth, singer songwriter.........(Sue has become a dear friend w/ Marsha, my wife Barbara, and me).....the next concert, no Peter, but yes from Noel and Dick Kniss, and they were joined on stage for the first time in nearly 40 years by Eric Andersen.... ​ - Barry Nisman My dear Cousin Peter, As I write this, my heart is filled with deep love for you and fervent thoughts for your well-being. I remember the first time I heard about you. My family lived in Harrisburg, Pa., far from our extended family from New York, Providence, and California. Mom proudly told me about you and Peter, Paul and Mary when I was old enough to understand. I was enchanted by your music and gorgeous harmonies and later, as I grew more mature in my understanding, your messages of peace, love, and hope. Mom also told me about the Burt family musicales, where the family gathered and shared their music together when both of you were quite young. She mentioned sometimes you seemed shy as you would quietly strum your guitar in the corner of the room, perhaps preparing for the time for you to display your talent that day. Then, years later you bloomed into the icon we all know and love today, dedicating your life to the pursuit of justice, human rights, peace, hope, and understanding. Most importantly was your message of love, which sprung from your heart prodigiously. I remember how proud Mom was of you, just as you were proud of her ability to play piano. I will never forget the time I first met you. I believe you were performing a solo concert at St. John the Divine in Manhattan. I had moved to New York City to pursue acting and singing, and couldn’t wait to try to finally meet you in person, if it were possible. Indeed, after the concert I was able to speak with you. After I introduced myself, you gave me the warmest embrace and invited me to meet your family at a later date. I was so happy when I eventually met Bethanny and Christopher, and you did your best to make me feel like part of the family. You always encouraged, supported, and helped me as I tackled my career pursuits, and later sent me to Kerrville to help me with my song-writing skills after a car accident made it impossible for me to work as an actress anymore. I remain very grateful to you. Now, many years later, your generosity continues, as you helped guide me through my difficult journey with cancer, even while you struggled with your own health. Mom and Dad had passed away years before and I missed not being able to speak with them as I faced and still face my fear and anxiety, but you were there for me and continue to be. Peter, you are always in my heart, and I will continue to pray for you as you navigate your own sojourn. May the same peace, love and hope that you have shared with the world be with you now. Love, Cathy Gale I am but one of millions of his fans and have a story about how he singled me out of the crowd bringing joy and a memory that makes me smile whenever I think of that evening. It was quite a few years ago at the Hutchinson Center in Belfast, Maine. Peter was there to share one of his children’s song books and do a few tunes! What an opportunity for someone like me who had been following PPM forever and always aspired to be Mary in the group! It was a small venue, rows of chairs set up in the large conference room. I got there extra extra early to get my seat front and center! Peter started playing and I sang right along with him, adding Mary’s part at times and bursting with joy as I sang. Peter stopped playing, looked at me and invited me up with him to sing If I had a Hammer. He paused to change the key on his guitar to better suit me. Here I was doing a duet with one of my most admired persons of all time! I wish I could say I did a great job, but it was more croaky than how I was singing as part of the audience! But I was sharing energy with Peter Yarrow and croaky or not it is a magical experience that I will always be able to access in my memory and enjoy that evening all over again! How kind Peter was that night to give me a chance to share his light which has shined all over the world. ​ - Diane Braybrook When I was a little girl, my sister used to play folk music on her record player. She was a hippy. 8 yrs older than i. I used to steal her albums and listen and sing along. Peter Paul and Mary and Joan Baez. I fell in love with both artists. When I was older, I’d go to as many folk concerts as possible. I’m from Vienna Va, so Wolf Trap was my place to go, as was the Birchmere. I was in a good area for folk music. In the 80’s, my boyfriend introduced me to a radio show, Musicamericana. Every Sunday night, we would listen to it. I was loving all the older and newer artists. I bought albums then cassette and cds. My collection is huge. I still will play cassettes and cds. Through those years, my favorite concerts were with Peter Paul and Mary. It was a regular at Wolf Trap. The last time was in 2007 or 2008. It was just Peter and Paul. Mary was too sick. We all knew at that time. She passed soon after. I cried. Now I cry again. I saw Peter in 2017 at a venue in Bethesda MD. It was wonderful. I was in the front row and got some good photos. It’s so hard to see this today. My heart is breaking to hear this bad news. My love and prayers to Peter, his family and friends. It’s so hard to see my hero’s pass. Paul is still the one to keep the word out. I know this will be really hard on him. We all send prayers to heal. Love you, Margaret On a Sunday afternoon while driving on Interstate 87 south through the majestic Adirondack Mountains in Upstate New York, we were listening to 60's Gold on Sirius XM in 2017. I was 60 and my wife was 55. She is from a different music generation, U2, The Police and The Talking Heads. I'm a child of the late 60's and early 70's. I had 2 older sisters and 2 older brothers. I grew to love the music of the 60's living on Long Island. The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Bob Dylan & The Who. But my favorite artists were the story tellers, Arlo Guthrie, Simon & Garfunkel and Peter, Paul & Mary. Back to the car ride through the Adirondacks. While listening to 60's Gold and singing to my hearts content. My wife's classic comment, I wish I had her video. She says, \"Who the hell knows EVERY word to Puff the Magic Dragon? I mean, EVERY word! Noone these days knows every word!\" She laughed so hard as I sung, EVERY WORD! It's a story we still tell. Around a fire by a lake with friends. Two of those friends also Peter, Paul & Mary fans. So we pull it up on YouTube and you know it, the three of us start singing Puff the Magic Dragon. Thank you Peter Yarrow, Paul Stookey and Mary Travers for the years of memories. For music shared through the generations. My mantra, Peace be the Journey (from the movie Cool Runnings). Jeff Gillham, Upstate NY, aka Opa This news deeply hurts my heart. This is my most heartfelt memory of your amazing father: As a child of the 1960s, I grew up a PP&M fan as it formed my sense of justice, freedom and equality. Every Sunday at the Sunday school I went to, Puff, the Magic Dragon was always playing in the background. I always looked forward to playing with my Sunday school friends. One in particular I always played with, so when he wasn’t there for a few months, I became curious as to why. Several months later, he finally showed up again, but this time he was confined to a wheelchair. Again, Puff was playing in the background. I was in total shock. He even tried to explain but my fear wouldn’t let me listen. Then, he was gone again. The next month the Sunday school class received the news that this young boy had passed away due to his illness. Again, as we were being told, Puff was playing. The lyric “Dragons live forever, but not so little boys..” I thought it was about my friend. It was about death. Little did I realize it was about the death of innocence. Despite this, I carried it around for decades until. I had the chance to tell your father in person this story. He responded by saying he would think of this story every time he would sing it. To this day, I cannot hear this song without tearing up. When I last spoke with your dad, he gave me the most beautiful hug I’ve ever experienced. I’ve uploaded it below. I attended Ms. Travers memorial in 2009. All three of those beautiful souls mean so much to me, to a whole generation. Please accept my deepest sympathy. I lost my dad two years ago. But I will always know that “a dragon lives forever.” Puff will live forever. Your father’s contribution to this world will live forever. ​ - Dennis Hall Peter is a great person as well as a great singer/songwriter. As I’ve always loved PP&M’s music about forty years ago I started taking my then two and a half year old daughter to their concerts. The very first concert was at Valley Forge Music Fair near Philadelphia. One of the men selling souvenirs gave my daughter a back stage pass and that was the start of something special for us. Peter paid a lot of attention to Mary Elizabeth (my daughter) and we still have some fantastic pictures from that night. From then on every Valley Forge Music Fair Concert we would go backstage for the post concert party and Peter was just fabulous to us. Once when we stopped at Dennys afterwards we bumped into Peter and he invited us to sit with him and his friends and bought us breakfast. Another time he talked to her from the stage during a concert when he caught sight of us in the audience. Our relationship with Peter was not only a fantastic celebrity meeting experience but also a bonding for my daughter and I as he provided us with a wonderful shared experience. As she got older we continued attending concerts at different venues as Valley Forge closed. To this day our love for PP&M’s music and Peter in particular is still an interest that we share. Last year at Christmas I bought her an album cover signed by all three and she immediately wanted to get it framed. I want to thank Peter for the great memories that Mary Elizabeth and I share to this day. He has most surely given us some of the best mother/daughter bonding moments as well as making a small girl feel loved and important. Peace and love, Peter and thanks again! ​ - Mary Lou Cavallini About 30 years ago I attended a Peter Paul and Mary concert at the Great Auditorium in Ocean Grove, NJ. This is a huge beautiful all wooden auditorium, built in 1894 by shipbuilders, that seats about 7000, and has amazing acoustics. It also has a marvelous organ, one of the largest in the country. After the intermission, Peter came out on stage by himself. He admired the tremendous pipes seen at the back of the stage. The organ itself was below the stage floor, as it is on a device that allows it to be raised and lowered as needed. Peter suddenly asked the audience, “Is there anybody out there tonight who knows how to work this?” After a few minutes a man from the audience came up, and our excitement rose as the organ rose out of the floor. The man sat down to play and looked to Peter for direction. At that, Peter led the audience as we all sang Amazing Grace along with him and the organ. Afterward, he said to us, “This is one of those moments that will someday give strength to an old folk singer. I have never forgotten that experience! Thank you Peter! Love, prayers and strength to you. ​ - Christine Scull I happened to be at McNally Jackson Books in SOHO, NYC sometime in August 2012, when Peter Yarrow held a mini concert to promote his books for children, \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" and \"It's Raining, It's Pouring\". Out of the blue, Peter Yarrow asked me from among the crowd to scan the book for the audience beside him while he sang the famous \"Puff\" song. I was so happy and can't believe I was beside him. I grew up in the Philippines listening to the songs of Peter Paul and Mary as introduced to me by my older brother who was a folk singer. After the mini concert, Peter Yarrow spent some time with me sharing his experiences with Paul and Mary during the Edsa Revolution in 1986 and the concert they held at Manila Hotel. Then he got my phone and asked a staff to take a photo of us. It was one of the best moments of my life. A few years later, me and my fellow alumni of Mindanao State University watched a concert of Peter Yarrow in Manhattan. Thank you so much Peter Yarrow for the precious memory. - Marie Fe Conde-Acera I was 13 years old when I fell in love with Folk music and of course Peter, Paul and Mary. Their music moved and motivated me as it did with so many members of my generation. I bought my first guitar in 1960 and slowly taught myself to play so that I could feel more a part of the wonderful stories and messages they taught. Their music and message is timeless and I find myself listening to them as much today as I did sixty years ago. In 2012 Peter came to my synagogue to perform for my Cantor's 25th Anniversary, and sang \"Don't laugh at me\" which moved me to tears. He also graciously allowed my Cantor and me to sing and play with him on stage, a moment that I have cherished ever since. In 2018 my grandchildren were troubled by how Puff the Magic Dragon ended, and so I wrote another verse to satisfy them. I always meant to share it with you Peter, but never felt right sending Puff's daddy my poor attempt to add something to a song cherished by millions. Peter, I do so now only in the hope that it may bring a smile to your face, and in spite of my trepidation, I know that you won't laugh at me. Little Jackie Paper grew up - as children will - one day he met and fell in love with a girl whose name was Jill... before too long they married and had a babe called Jacquie too... a beautiful little baby girl whose name was spelled with Q Little Jacquie Paper learned to love that rascal Puff and she brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff! Together they would play - with tea sets, dolls, and toys she taught him all the games she liked - he taught her a dragon's noise Jacquie showed he dragon that children grow up soon enough but there will always be another who will come and play with Puff. I always felt that the heart and soul of your music was Tikun Olam, the endeavor to make this world a better place. Through your music and your commitment to social action, you have done just that. I salute you, and thank you from the bottom of heart. Rabbi Avi Kapnek In 1987, I was fresh out of college, and was privileged to teach English in Nanjing, China. This was before Tiananmen Square, when China was still shaking off the vestiges of the Cultural Revolution. The occasional person wore a Mao suit, and there was only the beginning of cultural mingling between China and the United States. It was in that environment that I taught American conversational English. Our students, English teachers themselves, learned about American cities, sports, slang, and even a little bit of music. Somehow, I found a guitar, and I taught my students to sing Puff the Magic Dragon. They absolutely loved it. And for our closing ceremony, I sang Leaving on a Jet Plane. The students and staff enjoyed that as well, but I had to do an encore of Puff. That magical dragon helped this American girl to bridge a cultural divide. Even now, it’s one of my sweetest memories of my time in Nanjing. Thanks, Peter, for bringing Puff to life. ​ - Liz Fallin Puff was the very first song I learned and loved as a child and the Trio's music has been my favorite of all music throughout my life, and I was fortunate enough to see them live finally, many years ago. In subsequent years I was also fortunate enough to see Peter and Noel Paul play together on several occasions and once, I was beyond fortunate enough to take my Mom, also a lifetime fan, to see Peter and Christopher together and meet them both which was another level of magic. What an absolute joy and blessing in every way, Peter has been to the entire human race and planet and his magic will resonate in every way throughout generations to come and will live on through Christopher and Bethany. Thank you for sharing your wonderful Dad with all of us and for the amazing gifts of words, music and projects that have made and will continue to make the world a more loving and beautiful place. May his amazing love and spirit surround all who love him and may all find peace and comfort and so much gratitude for all of his magic <3 ​ - Karen Miller Dear Peter, As a 70's child who grew up with parents who played PP&M on the record player and the radio, then the 8-track, cassette tape, CD and now streaming digital channels, and many concerts in person, I want to ​tell you that I love you and thank you for sharing your time, talent and yourself with ​me and my family. My dad first saw you and Noel Paul and Mary in Chicago in the 60's and I was fortunate enough to join him and my mom and my brother at your concerts in the 70's, 80's and beyond. Each time, each moment was magic.​ Holy. A prayer and a communion between you and us in the audience. As the song goes, \"light one candle...\" and you have lit so many candles in each one of us, from childhood for some and in adulthood in others. I am who I am because of having you as a role model and the messages you shared, the examples you set, and the kindness and generosity you showed me ​as an audience and personally​ as a fan. When I was taking guitar lessons at the Old Town Folk School of Music in Chicago​ in the late 2000's, I was ​fortunate to see you and Bethany and Rufus​ perform in person. I waited after the show, hoping to see you, and you stopped and gave me a big hug and kiss and chatted with me while you signed my guitar. It meant the world to me. I have been so inspired by your activism and your conviction in the goodness in people and the common bond we share as brothers and sisters, regardless of how we are labeled or identify ourselves. Your causes are all of our causes. ​All of us, grandparents, adult children, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren and beyond will continue to carry your light in each of us, and that light will never go out. I've seen to it that my daughter, now 12, has grown up listening to your music, and the importance of what your music is saying, as well as how you put your beliefs into action. The people who I have helped over my 54 years, and who have offered me help, from my co-worker with no car to my refugee neighbors in Chicago, to my beloved first boss, who didn't fire me when I made a $300,000 mistake and who taught me Hebrew and treated me like family...each time it's because you helped make me who I am today: A person who will stand up for what's right, who extends a hand to anyone who needs it, who speaks for the weak and marginalized, and who doesn't tolerate bigotry or bullying, and who uses the power and gifts I have for good, anywhere and everywhere I can. My father is responsible for bringing you and PP&M into our lives. Although I think it was Mary's golden hair that first got his attention, it was your guitar playing, incredible voice, and your powerful message that captivated him and inspired him to put you at the very top of his musical and life influences. He also learned to play the guitar to play your songs. I'm so grateful for his excellent music taste and his judgement of character. He's about to turn 80 and his memory is fading but he still remembers everything about each time he saw you and Noel and Mary in person as well as the albums. I re-posted Bethany's message on my Facebook page and added my own stories. I concluded my message with the following: ​\"We're living in stressful time​s right now.​ Even the best of people can be tempted, in hard times, to justify vilifying ​\"this person​\" or ​\"that group​.​\" ​ It's easy to make blanket statements, to become cynical, to give up on humanity. Popular​- and social​-media make it seem like people have to pick a \"side.\" ​ If people feel th​at way, I hope they pick the side that shows up for their family, friends, ​co-workers and neighbors with empathy. Don't let hate win. Don't let our differences blind us to each other's humanity. ​Peter ​never stopped working for what he believed in, with humility and compassion. He's a bright light in the world. ​He would want us all to be courageous and work for Peace, especially ​now.​\" Thank you for the laughter, the pauses, the deep thoughts, the consoling nights, the outrage and call to action, and all of the love. Love is the greatest gift you give us. We are beyond grateful for it and it will keep growing. All of us will see that you are never forgotten. With Love and Gratitude, Shannon Gallagher Schock, Friend and Fan Forever In 2011 I had the privilege to go to a concert Peter and his son Christopher performed in at my alma mater Fitchburg State University, in Fitchburg, MA. HIs music, message and love of humanity shined thru during the concert. Following the concert, I had the honor to meet and speak with him personally. He greeted me with a smile, looked me in the eye and asked me what I did for work, at the time I was working in Oncology and Palliative care. He shared with me that he too worked on the board at the Branford Hospice House, in CT. He spoke about helping others, to my surprise he took my hand and kissed it. Then blessing me for caring for the others. Dearest Peter, a heartfelt thank you for your grace, compassion and music you have imparted with humankind. Your music lives on as does your spirit! May you feel the embrace of warmth, love and care holding you gently and securely as you rest. Now in return, I bless you. May God’s peace and love be with you Peter. Charlotte Bell I don't even know how many PP&M concerts my husband and I have been to over the years. Their music always made my husband and I smile. And we had so many memories of Peter. We once, accidentally, had the hotel room next to him when we traveled to Green Bay WI for the concert. We only realized it when we all came out of our rooms at the same time for the breakfast the next day. The one memory that stands out was the memorial service for Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota in 2002. I saw Peter a few feet away from us after the service, near the Green Bus. (Peter will know what that is.) He was carrying his guitar and talking to someone about it. He said he wanted to pay tribute to his freind Paul. Peter had tears in his eyes, and his words trembled. I had seen that look on stage, but I always thought it was part of the act. Seeing him outside, on the sidewalk, with no audience, holding back tears of grief for his friend made me realize that he was always that caring and loving, that it was never an act. Love to Peter! ​ - Jean James I grew up with your music in my home. I wore out my tape of Peter, Paul, and Mommy as a child. My dad is a nurse who worked nights so he was only able to sing me to sleep on the weekends and I always requested Puff! It's still a very special song for us because of those memories. As I got older, especially when I went to college and started learning more about the world and became passionate about human rights and how to make a difference fighting for them, the rest of your music started resonating. I had always known your songs, but as an adult, I truly understand and appreciate them and their impact. You have left such a mark on the world and have such a special place in my heart. I don't have the words to tell you just how much you and your music mean to me. I'm now pregnant with my first child and you can rest assured, your music will live on. I will make sure my child also grows up in a home filled with the wonderful messages of your music. Your legacy will continue for generations to come. Thank you for the music. Thank you for the difference you've made in the world. And a very special thank you for that rascal, Puff. ​ - Ashley I was Peter’s housekeeper for a time for his place outside Telluride. Ski Ranches? It’s been almost 20 years. Peter, you were always so incredibly kind to me. You would stop and talk with me, ask me about my dreams, and when I told you my degree was in art/painting, always after that you’d ask me if I was making art. One time many years later I was buying a guitar from someone and met him at a coffee shop in Lawson Hill. I didn’t know how to play guitar really, was just wanting to learn. You walked up, saw me on the bench and remembered me, and so kindly were willing to take it from me and play a little tune. You declared it perfect for me and I still have it. I think of you with such incredible fondness, such love, you saw me at a time that I needed to feel seen, and somehow you knew it. What an incredible teacher and mentor you are. Thank you for the way you walk this earth. ​ - Jana Stone To my dearest HeartFriend, the Dragon Mensch, Peter Yarrow, How can I compress into words all that you have meant to me in the last 43 years? From the moment that you called out to the audience inviting us to \"come on down and meet us after the show!\"...I made a beeline for the stage door and you Dear Dragon were the first through the door conscripting me on your right side and another person on your left to usher yourself through the crowd. You asked me to act as \"cup bearer\" going backstage to retrieve more wine when you were running out. When the crowd finally thinned you asked me and all the folks with me that night...my Girlfriend and another couple we were double-dating with...out to dinner at the Ringside. Everyone else politely declined citing early work and school commitments. I thought they were nuts and gladly joined you for dinner expecting nothing but and wonderful dinner talking with one of my Heroes. We ended up talking about everything from your special connection to Portland Oregon...your dear Wife MaryBeth, to our mutual pull to be Artists...I was in Art School at the time...to some of your exploits with the Trio.The Ringside kindly stayed open well past closing time to feed us steak and lobster and their famous onion rings! When we finally were getting our coats to say our \"Goodbyes\" you looked across the table at me in the oddest way and said, \"I don't usually do this but, there is something about you...you reached into your coat pocket and pulled out a business card. You wrote your personal address and phone number on the back and handed it to me asking me to stay in touch! I was completely surprised...on top of everything Wonderful that night...from my first PP&M concert, to meeting you all to dinner and chatting into the wee hours over an awesome dinner with you my dear Peter. We started writing back and forth...this was 1982 long before laptops and cellphones...and the following year you had me meet the rest of the PP&M Family...the last time you guys came back to Portland after only 12 months between concerts...you gave me a few unsold seats to pass out to my Art School Friends. That was the beginning of my induction into the inner circle or the \"Peter, Noel and Mary Family\"! Soon I was tagging along on parts of each year's Tour. Traveling with you all and getting to know everyone over the years...taking literally hundreds of photographs...and eating your awesome salad with dinner backstage no matter where we were...that \"Family Dinner\" with your special salad helped to anchor everyone...almost as much as joining hands in the wings for \"the Hum\" just before you all ran out to start singing. I don't know how many times I watched from the wings as you, Noel and Mary worked your magic with first just Dick Kniss on Bass...then you all added Paul Prestopino. Sigh. Mary, Dickie and Presto will be there to greet you my dear Dragon. You taught me so very much...most especially that there is a special bond that goes well past a \"normal\" friendship...that Heart bonded kind of Friendship I have called my \"HeartFriends\"...you opened my Heart to see beyond the superficial dross of the fame and fortune surrounding you to meet you on a Higher Plane. I am so very proud to be able to call you my HeartFriend...a deep bond of love that has spanned 43 years of triumphs and heartbreaks...from the highs like you sharing \"Light One Candle\" with me shortly after you wrote it to the heart wrenching loss of Mary...my own tough fight with Breast Cancer...and your valiant battle with Cancer...my dearest Dragon you have fought the \"Good Fight\" stretching from today's fight with Cancer and the evils of Hate all the way back to protesting our involvement in Vietnam and Marching for Equality with MLK, being on the podium with him as he spoke his most famous words...\"I have a Dream...\"! You have lived your life pushing yourself beyond normal Human endurance to accomplish more than any hundred more ordinary Men. We Family Members often referred to your seemingly tireless action as your \"Energizer Bunny Model\"....always up and running for each Good Cause...you have pushed yourself to a much deserved rest my dear HeartFriend. My sweet Dragon, Peter now is the time to pass the Torch on to the next Generation...having set an example for us all to try to follow. Were you without some Human failings? No. But, you showed us your dear, sweet complicated Heart...as big as the sky above all of us who have had the honor, the Joy to call you our beloved Dragon! Go through that last threshold in Peace my dearest Peter. This is only \"Goodbye for now\" not forever...I will see you again with your open arms, open Heart and your impish grin...on the flip side! With my love always... your HeartFriend, Holly Page Bryant Dearest Peter, For the past 30+ years I've had the tremendous honor of being an adopted if somewhat elusive and reclusive member of the Yarrow family. And whether or not I'm in contact, you're always on my mind: sometimes in the form of fond memories of dinners and tipis, sometimes as the voice in my head that says do the right thing, be less selfish, more generous, kinder, let people know that you care. For it is from you and Mary Beth and the values with which you raised your children that have helped shape who I am on a good day, and you've accepted me despite my many flaws. Christopher is one of my closest friends and favorite people, and I know you appreciate my relationship with him. I'm grateful to him for many things, not the least of which is his sharing you with me. I've enjoyed the time I've spent with you and wish there were more, and that I hadn't wasted so much. I love you dearly, Papa Peter, and I will miss you tremendously and never forget you or how you've changed me for the better. Through your career in music you've achieved immortality, and your activism will have enduring effects on the world, but I didn't put off contributing to this website for four days to write about that (although it seems strange not to acknowledge it). In truth, I don't want to say goodbye. Imperfectly, incompletely and with sincere gratitude and adoration, Nasti/Anastasia Until I met Peter, while living in Colorado, I had no idea how much fun a classically-trained cellist could have jamming, improvising, and occasionally performing folk and political-movement music with Peter...in venues ranging from living rooms to sold-out auditoriums. Not only is he a musical icon, but he's so warm and approachable as a person that it's been easy not to be awe-struck, but just to have fun making music. And his songs are equally so approachable musically and structurally that it's easy to step outside the classical framework and just \"be free.\" One of the greatest compliments I've ever been paid was when, after playing an entirely unrehearsed version of \"The Great Mandala\" together (to a packed 700-seat house), Peter turned to me and said \"remember what you did just now--I'd never heard it like this before, and it really works.\" Another fond memory: hiking together on Faraway Ranch, a 1000 acre parcel in Colorado that Peter was instrumental (pun intended) in preserving. I picked a little feathery frond from an unassuming plant and showed it to Peter. \"Do you know what this is, Peter?\" \"No, no idea.\" \"That's...yarrow!\" Thanks, Peter, for all you've done--but even more, for who you are. ​ - Peter Lert I was a very little girl when I first met Puff and was introduced to PPM. I think I was six. I was so young, that I thought Jackie Paper had died and I cried each time I heard the song, until a few years later when I realized, like me, Jackie Paper was growing up. Since then, Puff has been a substantial part of my life. I've sung the song to all of my children, my grandchildren, and I will to my greatgrandchildren as soon as I can get to Florida to see them. Peter, you have been an inspiration to me my whole life and not just because of Puff, but because of the other songs that you have brought into the world. If not for PPM, I would not know songs like \"Lemon Tree\" or \"Light one Candle\" or oh so many others. You've brought so much joy to me and my children, I hope this project shows you how one life can impact the world. Know that you are loved and respected. ​ - Lori Hicks Hi Peter. I am a 58 year old from Ontario, Canada. I have been listening to Peter, Paul & Mary since I was very young. My family did not have very many records but we did have \"In The Wind.\" The album is older than I am. Our record player was one of those stereo consoles and I would lean against it and listen to the vocal parts coming from the two speakers. It was my early introduction to great vocal parts and harmonies. I would also sit with a guitar (without all of it's strings) and try to pick out the chords. Peter, Paul & Mary's music has been with me for my whole life's journey. Your music helped to make me a strong singer and musician and your activism and example shaped me into the person that I am. I had the pleasure of meeting you once when you were in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I was thrilled to see you live in concert and meet you afterwards. It was a dream come true to see you. I am so glad that you are getting to hear and see these tributes. They are all so well deserved. I wish you much love and peace in your final days. You changed my life and I will forever be grateful to you. ​ - Heather Topps Dear Peter, Growing up as a child of the '70s in Oregon your music was in our household and listened to frequently and now part of my life for more than 50 years. In the 1990s and beyond I had the pleasure of seeing you perform in Portland, Oregon both solo and also as part of \"Peter, Paul, and Mary\" at a massive concert on the waterfront with tens of thousands of people, then again at the Schnitzer Concert Hall. It was such a great pleasure to see you on stage again earlier this year with Noel at the Golden State Theatre in Monterey, California. Such a wonderful show! I want to thank you for the music, for the activism, and for letting your light shine all of these years. Sending all my love and good thoughts to you! - Anthony Wynn I've had the great honor of being Peter and Noel's booking agent for many years. Helping them bring their songs and their stories to so many people has been a blessing. Growing up, the music of Peter, Paul and Mary impacted me in such a way that in my teens I became a song leader in the Jewish community and taught their music to kids. The joy with which we would all sing these songs was contagious. For me to years later become a part of Peter and Noel's lives was at first surreal, but now I realize it was meant to be. Earlier this year I brought my wife and 12 year old daughter to see a Peter and Noel concert. The three of us sang along in harmony. My daughter was so excited to point out every song she recognized. Peter Yarrow is one of the kindest, gentlest souls I have ever met. His smile lights up every room; his warmth makes anyone in his presence feel loved. I know in my heart that I would not be the man I am today without Peter. His never-ending desire to spread peace and love has truly impacted the world. I am grateful for Peter and will love him always. ​ - Craig Newman So many words to say. Peter, you have lifted me with your music, your humor and commitment to world peace since I was a young girl. My 5 siblings and I wore out the Peter, Paul and Mary albums in the house--we had most of them! Then, I was privileged to see you perform in Denver a little while back. I work with children through our Denver Conflict Center and read books to the kids about nonviolent conflict resolution, so I was thrilled to hear about your efforts to bring attention to bullying behavior--and to use your CD with our program. Music speaks louder than words, indeed...Know that your spirit has touched us all and I am very grateful for your gifts. Sending love and peace as you travel-on. ​ - Nancy McGuire P, P and M had such a huge impact on my life. Your songs carried me through good times and bad, and formed the foundation of my belief in peace and mutual respect. I remember sitting around with my brothers and sisters, singing your songs in the 60’s and 70’s, a tradition I carried forward with my own children and now my grandchildren. I was fortunate to meet you in New York City, when you did a special presentation/sing-a-long for operation respect, for teachers at the public library. Seeing you in person and hearing your music moved me to tears. It was a moment I had waited for my whole life, to meet you in person. I was especially moved when you sang The Cruel War. My son was in Iraq at the time, during Operation Iraqi Freedom and you had such kind, comforting words. Thank you for being you, for giving us a social consciousness in a time strife and for filling our lives with music.. You are forever in our hearts, Teresa VandenBosch On December 8, 2023, the officiant who married us did so with adaptations of the lyrics to \"Weave Me the Sunshine\" - a song which has served us well for decades and will continue to do so for decades to come. Here is what she wrote: “Annie and Eric, you are a couple that is so neat. To see you both together is truly a treat. You’ve both known each other for a very long time and have a love and friendship that’s truly sublime. So now the next chapter of matrimonial love begins - You’ll climb new mountains and drink from golden fountains. May you always know you’ll weave in the sunshine; you’ll weave in the rain, and can continue to fill each other’s cups over and over again.” Peter & Eric have had several opportunities to meet and briefly chat over the years here in Pittsburgh - either after a PP&M concert or solo act. The first being in 1989 at the Syria Mosque when Eric was all of 12 years old! This and ALL of the occasions that followed are precious memories. But the attached photo (dated March 16, 2010) shows the brief moment we were \"Peter, Eric & Annie\". Annie was a bit \"star-struck\", but soon realized she too had a friend in Peter Yarrow. We are sharing and sending our love and wrapping you virtually in our arms with the hugs we know you like to give and receive. Keep singing... we'll be singing along! ​ - Eric & Annie O'Brien When I was ten years old, a very famous man came to our town for his wedding to a doctor's daughter. My friends and I stood outside of the church and peered in through the window to watch. He performed at our little Catholic school and his songs won my heart and informed my soul on how I wanted to live. My first album was \"Peter, Paul and Mommy.\" I have shared those songs (on a record player) with a few generations of children(even some friends of his own children)! Perhaps his biggest impact was decades later when, as a school guidance counselor, I ran into his \"Operation Respect\" program. He created it to stop school bullying. Sixteen years of sixth grade students were, like me, informed on how to live. \"Don't Laugh at Me\" touched them in ways a talking to or a lecture on kindness couldn't. They learned to see others' humanity. Peter... Mahalo, mahalo. Mahalo Nui for all you have sung about. For all you have cared about. May your passing be peaceful and pain free. You will always be a touch stone. ​ - Susan Pirsch We are a Brazilian family of four, mother, father, and two boys. In 2012 we lost our daughter and went to the underworld. In our desperation, we sought ways out. What we decided was to honor our daughter by social initiatives, donations, deeds in her name. We decided to donate a library to the Arab Jewish Community Center in Jaffa, Tel Aviv, where children from all creeds could work and play together. And so we did. We invited Peter Yarrow to go to Israel for the inauguration and he immediately accepted. He was there with us on October 15, 2015 , sang songs, honored our daughter, and donated his name, image, and energy to raise the occasion. Today, the library is one of the most visited in the whole country and one of the only seeking to unite different people in these difficult times. Our sincere appreciation! Anna Laura (in memoriam), Arthur, Felipe, Claudia & Rudi Fischer Dear Peter, I remember the first time I heard your voice ring out in “Blowing in the Wind”. The honesty and authenticity in your voice was so unique. It pulled me into, not only the music but the profound meaning of Dylan’s words. It “awakened” and inspired me to become more aware of the world and the injustices that needed to be fought for. I still get a kind of hallowed feeling the moment I hear the guitar intro to that song and your heartfelt expression of the lyrics. It stops me every time I hear it. With your music, your activism, your unrelenting positive spirit, and love of life, you changed my world and the world of millions of others . We need more Peter Yarrow’s in this world, especially now. I met you around 1965 in Cincinnati Ohio. I was 18. I was a member of Monday’s Children, a folk group. Peggy Wahl and Erich Silvester (Zwertschek), both 16 at the time, were the other two members. You heard us sing after a Peter Paul and Mary concert at the Cincinnati Music Hall . You seemed taken by our harmony and invited us to have breakfast with you the next morning at the Gibson Hotel where you were staying. You said you had an idea for our group. We couldn’t have imagined what this idol of ours could possibly have in mind for 3 star-struck folk singing kids. I can remember the feeling and the excitement having breakfast with you, the man who wrote Puff the Magic Dragon, had the number one hit on the charts and was changing hearts and minds with your socially conscious songs. At breakfast you told us that you had written jingles for a tv commercial for Esso Gasoline. The Advertsing Agency , Dancer Fitzgerald, was looking for a Peter Paul and Mary kind of “sound” for the jingle. You thought our harmony was perfect for the jingle. Next thing I knew we were being flown to New York City to record at Phil Ramon’s studio, another wow moment for the group. You were our musical director, Dick Kniss was our bass player, Al Grossman was our producer. We were beside ourselves. What a gift! You gave us one of the most memorable days of our lives. I still have vivid memories of the recording session. How generous, how kind, how supportive. There are no words. (And we all got our Aftra Cards to boot). After the Esso Gasoline Commercial you brought us back to New York a second time to record another jingle you wrote for Rivienna Foods; a River Brand Rice commercial. Both commercials went nationwide. The residuals from those commercials paid for the rest of my college education at the University of Cincinnati , and for my first car, a Volkswagon Beetle. It was a great financial help to my mom and dad. I will be forever grateful for your kindness and generosity and impact it had on my young life.. In 1980 I directed an off-off Broadway production of Tennesse Williams, “Suddenly Last Summer”. Though it was only my second time producing and directing a play, you thought the show was worthy of a Broadway production. The second time you came to see the show you brought an investor. A few weeks later you held a backers event in your apartment to get the project off the ground. The Little theater on w. 44th Street was the destination. Though the project didn’t happen as planned, your support, enthusiasm and your belief in me and the project gave me the confidence to continue producing and directing shows, which I did into retirement. At 78 I’m singing again, writing shows and performing them. I don’t think any of this would be happening without your genuine enthusiasm, and support of me way back then. I am eternally gratefully. It is an honor and a privilege to know you. Love, Bob Simonello Peter, Paul, & Mary !! You All were the ones I learned to love to sing with & still love singing to this very day !! My fondest memories are of my Auntie teaching me how to play the guitar and sing Puff The Magic Dragon when I was nine years old !! That was in 1966. Thank You for the incredible music and the beautiful life of singing along with you !! Happy Way Over to the Other Side !! Keep on Singing All The Way !! Blessed Be ​ - Lauren Sylvis I have never known a life without my brother Peter, his music, his civil and human rights activism, his international leadership in bringing people together and of course his concerts with Paul and Mary. But I particularly remember United Voices for Education, an offshoot of Peters's Operation Respect, of which I had the honor of serving as Chair with friend Molly McCloskey as Vice-Chair and staffer Elizabeth Kolodny with many national education advocate members supporting positive school climate in national policies. Ah, the Hill visits we had in pushing social and emotional learning, you with your guitar and starting each Hill meeting with Puff, and my favorite song Have you Been to Jail for Justice--and all young staff from offices far and wide come in to join. And then Peter's Christmas reception at Rep Rosa DeLauro's hill town house. Peter, you have been such an impact on my life and I remember forever your energy and your commitment to all causes children and democracy going back to the big 1963 March and NYC, The Bitter End. Peace good friend. ​ - Arnold Fege I love you Peter!!You have meant so much to me and my family over the years. PP&M was my grandfather's favorite choice of music. We all went to Red Rocks in 1969. I was 11 years old. Every time you were in Colorado I went and met you doing your meticulous sound checks at the rocks! Thanks for letting me join you on stage. Years later, I joined you and Molly for the Kindness campaign in Colorado Springs. You stayed at my bed and Breakfast Inn. You met my sons Patrick and Sean and you listened so intently as Patrick scratched out twinkle twinkle little star on his violin. He was 4 years old and probably because of you big hug as a reward he plays to this day. You invited the boys up on stage many times for Puff the Magic Dragon sing along. You mean the world to us! At the Tuned In workshop, Patrick and I met Christopher. Later we all went to dinner. You wore that silly napkin on your head. What a wonderful weekend we had. We loved seeing you on your birthday at Kerrville. Thanks for sharing your cake. I have so many fond memories of you! Love always! Karen Peter performed at the Clearwater Revival MANY TIMES He joined us, The Walkabout Clearwater Chorus, a few times and he asked us too join him to perform at the Revival. He could ALWAYS be counted on to help raise funds for the Sloop Clearwater, the Environmental Educational Sloop Pete and Toshi Seeger were instrumental in having built. So when Peter asked us to join him, as well as other musicians, to perform for a PBS Fundraiser show, we said yes and he opened his home for us to meet for our first rehearsal and he fed us dinner I have seen him perform for other Good Causes also He has a REAL DESIRE to use his Celebrity Status to DO GOOD to make this World a BETTER PLACE ​ - Pat Evans I met Peter in 1975 when, as a disc jockey in willmar, mn, i spotted him walking by our radio booth at the county fair...he approached me, so i asked when we could sit down for an interview...he said, \"why don't you come out to the lake when you're done tonight? i'll give you directions\"... from that time on he & mary beth treated me as if they'd known me all their lives...i spent many great evenings at the lake place, where i was always welcomed by his in-laws, & had the honor of spending hours in conversation with his mother vera, an effusive & loveable personality......my friendship with the mccarthy family is a memory i've cherished all these years & their christmas eve get-togethers were always unforgettable & imbued w/the communal spirit of the man i called \"yaroshevitch the craftsman\"(far more than a musician, his hands were skilled in the many tasks of lakehome maintenance as well)...he allowed me to observe his studio skills as well, as he painstakingly produced an album for an area band....his easy charm warmed my heart then, as now......he & his family are always in my thoughts & prayers & with that in mind as the holidays approach, i'm sending along a christmas song inspired by the 5 beautiful christmas eves i was invited to spend w/them... ​ - Johnny Antonelli Dearest Peter... I will never forget the moment I met you for the first time, backstage at Arise. I honestly didn't know who you were in that moment, the music legend part of you anyway. But that night, I met the kindness and most gentle man, with the biggest and warmest smile, and the purest and most compassionate heart. I loved every moment we shared over those few festival years... singing songs, long talks, watching you light up as you watched Bethany perform or Valentina playing nearby, hearing you talk and share your heart with so many people. When you hugged me, it was the best of hugs. When we talked, I have rarely ever felt so seen. Knowing you, for how briefly I was given the gift of this, left such an incredible imprint on my life and I am better for it. You have done many wonderful things in your life, but to me there is nothing more amazing than the man you are beneath it all. Thank you for the memories and for sharing some moments of your precious life with me. I will continue to cherish you and carry you in my heart. I hope to see you again. With love, Grace Oh Peter, I am sending my gratitude, love and light to you while you are preparing to leave, not on a jetplane, but on angelwings to be a light and inspiring musician on the other side. I love your activism, musicality and unwavering good humour and passion you so freely shared with others. You will be forever in mine and so many other peoples hearts with the music you have spread around the globe. Thank you and bon voyage. I hope you know not to be scared of this last transition in this lifetime. I have read and talked to people who came back from the other side that makes it clear to me that there is nothing to fear. The people who have passed before you will welcome you with open hearts and sing with you lovingly. Fly away gently and peacefully. ​ - Ulli Sir Jesse Dear Peter (Pedro) My big brother, we first met when PP&M did a benefit concert for Paul O'Dwyer's Senate campaign in 1968. What a journey you have led that I have had the joy of observing or participating in first hand as you defined Tikkun Olam. Never a human cause too small to advance but, of course, highlighted by your founding of Operation Respect and the love, time and effort you poured into building it. We shared so many wonderful times in Telluride, skiing, running to the next SHOW at Film Festival and our nights preparing our feasts to consume. Your political activism never waned, even from the mountains where you took us to a remote studio where we recorded the song that helped to save the then floundering John Kerry's bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2004. Today we are so pleased that Mary Beth, Bethany and Christopher are there to help care for you. Our family cherishes you, our times together and all that you have done to make our world a better place. With Love and Peace Your little dragon brother Paul (Pablo) Nussbaum I only met Peter once in person, and he was as delightful and kind as one could possibly hope. I'd, of course, been a fan for decades. I'm uploading a (mediocre) version of Puff I sang and recorded for my mom as part of her Christmas gift one year, long before I ever got to meet Peter or Bethany. I didn't have money for gifts, but I spent a week recording her an album of karaoke covers on my cheap laptop with my lack of editing skills or recording equipment, and of course Puff made the CD, because what better song could there be to sing to your mom? Peter is one of those souls whose kindness is so uncontainable it has spread far beyond his sphere and touched so very many millions he'll never meet. He's made this world a significantly better place. ​ - Conrad Shaw Peter, your music has always been iconic in my life since the early 1960s when I was growing up in Santa Barbara. The world of which you sang was magical and benevolent and full of wonder to my young ears. Peter your music helped me maintain that wonderful and build a foundation of love. When I met your dear daughter, Bethany I was inspired me to explore more the world of music and indigenous cultures. Which remain central to my practice as an artist and poet. Thank you, Peter, your music stays with me every day and propels me forward to be kind to others in this world. With love Les in NYC Peter...what words are there to describe you? Pinching my cheeks backstage at a concert'--'oh you cute..'--and your infectious laugh..Do you remember dancing at the Japanese restaurant in Beverly Hills while we waited for our food, curling yourself around the elegant pillars? But also, your wizened heart, those soulful eyes, the way you care about things so passionately, foot stomping as you play that guitar. Laughs, kisses and a big hug of love to you and all around you. If I could be there, I would pinch and kiss your cheeks, hold your hand and thank you for all you've been in this crazy world...And to Christopher and Bethany--let's carry forward all those memories, the power of music and the care for the world. Love you all! xo ​ - Anna Stookey I had the honor of working with Peter on the Unity Concert in the Black Hills of South Dakota. I have put together a fundraiser for the concert in Boulder, Colorado, and Fort Collins, Colorado. When we did the fundraiser in Boulder, Peter came early and spent most of the day with us, which was such a delight. I always called him my skin angel, because of his amazing kindness! This is something I will never forget, and weep as I write it here. My beautiful roommate from college was in the process of dying of breast cancer at that time. She was a singer and had the most beautiful voice. An article had been written about her where she acknowledged that Peter, Paul & Mary had been one of her inspirations to go into music. I took it with me that day, and when there was a quiet moment, I asked Peter to sign it so I could send it to my dear friend, Debra. To my surprise, before signing it, Peter went over to a quiet chair and read the entire article. That moment is forever in my heart! When I told the story to my dear friend Debra, it meant so much to her! We both wept because Peter’s caring touched us so deeply! Thank you, dear skin angel, Peter, for all the blessings and love you have showered on our beloved Mother Earth, and the people! - Lisa Bealafeld-Beck As I sat beside you on a wintry day in 2019 in the fragrant cozy kitchen of the Waterfall House, I felt one word emanating from you: Beloved. You were loved and you loved all of us profoundly and purely, regardless of whether we were Bethany, Christopher and Mary Beth or whether we had just met. The room was filled with that love, with you at it’s warm, bright, soft core. All the words we spoke, the causes we discussed, all the laughter, friendships, and good food we shared that morning, we were beloved. Your voice and music has threaded my life, the cultural literacy I share with so many. There have been other times I have been privileged to sing the familiar songs with you and others under summer moonlight, chills running down my back with the enormity of experience. But on that winter Sunday morning, I was included in your circle of beloved-ness and for that I will be forever grateful. Thank you, Peter. You have made a difference Mary-Howell Martens PP&M's music changed my life. In the early '60s, I would often spend several summer weeks at my aunt & uncle's house in Georgetown (DC), soaking up huge amounts of a forward-leaning metro lifestyle, as much as an 11-year old's brain could. Just before one such trip, I heard PP&M singing, \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" on the Today show, and, for the first time, I realized that songs could be much more than, 'do-wop' June/moon/spoon nascent rock&roll entertainments, that music could - and should - speak to important intellectual and social issues. When I got to DC, I bought the album and played it nearly incessantly. I had received a tenor guitar from another uncle, and I bought the sheet music for the album and practiced and memorized every song. I did the same with each succeeding album. Three years later, I formed a folk music trio with two friends and achieved some measure of regional success; we included a number of their songs in our set lists. Not only did the words convey important messages, but Peter's & Noel's guitar playing (and Russ' bass) guided my own approach, and the 'rolling fingerstyle' remains a central element of my music. So, Peter, if this message gets to you, thank you for this marvelous toy you've given so freely to so many, and know that you will be well and long remembered. -- Chip Levy (The Northeasterns) Peter is the only one of the trio I got to see in person. It was at a book festival in Hyland Park in Bloomington, MN. I was working a booth with the nature center but told them since it was my birthday I was taking my lunch break to go listen to him perform. He sang the version of Puff where Jackie Paper's daughter met Puff so the legend would carry on. I didn't get the chance to meet him since I had to be back working, but he did see me taking his picture while he was doing a sound check. Peter, Paul and Mary were my favorite group. Loved all their music with their beautiful harmony. They are my go to when I need a rest from the world. Thankfully their music will live forever...just like Puff! Thank you Peter, Paul and Mary for the music. ​ - Pauline I grew up listening to Pete, Paul, and Mary's LPs. I still remember all the songs. They taught me a lot about what it means to sing with other people. In November1969, I participated in the Moritorium to End the War in Vietnam in Washington where PP&M performed. It was a red-letter date in my life, especially singing \"Give Peace a Chance\" with Pete Seeger. Over the years, I've led people in singing many of PP&M's songs. From 2013 to 2019, Sunrise Ranch in Loveland, Colorado held the Arise Music and Camping Festival. For some of those years, Peter played, sometimes with Bethany. It was an honor to get the know his gentle yet fierce spirit. He commanded an audience as ever. And he had undying passion for the advancement of human culture. Recently, I played a YouTube video of PP&M playing \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" at the Newport Folk Festival. I played it for Sunday morning service, and people sang along. It was remarkably relevant for our times. And their voices, their passion, and the synergy between them is still epic. It is amazing what a big part of your musician like Peter can play over a lifetime. He has been a great gift to me, and I know there many, many people who've had the same experience. Thank you, Peter. You are amazing! Thank you. ​ - David Karchere I've been a fan of Peter, Paul and Mary since high school. I am now 73. I've seen you all live a couple of times in Houston, the last time on a revolving stage. After the concert you and Noel signed my album and you gave me a hug. That was maybe 30 or so years ago. But my most-enduring memory is your song \"Weave Me the Sunshine\" way back in 1972, I think. I designed my own stationery on bright yellow paper with a bold graphic sun (long before computer graphic software) along with those words, and I used that stationery for years. Peter, I know you're nearing your transition into Love. I want you to know that you have brought sunshine and joy into my world. God's mercies are new every morning--great is God's faithfulness! ​ - Janet Troy Peter was playing in Portland Oregon He called my son Dan up on the stage to help sing the chorus of Puff the Magic Dragon.Dan is a musician and artist and has Down syndrome That moment thrilled Dan and he still talks about it.We also shared stories about protest and song and how Peter used his music to reach audiences in profound ways especially young people We also see his presence in his son Christopher.Music is eternal and Peter will live on in his music and through his family.I hope that you are surrounded by love and music on your last journey Peter and thank you for your generosity. ​ - Angela Jarvis-Holland I grew up with \"Peter, Paul & Mommy\" on vinyl when I was in grade school. I sang \"Puff\" with my sister on stage at a school presentation when I was in kindergarten in 1964 or so. I grew up with Pete Seeger and your PP&M. They all were the soundtrack of my youth, along with Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, and later Holly Near and dozens that followed. But Pete Seeger and PP&M were there first because they were accessible to us children. As I got older I found that I shared a synagogue with Peter. B'nai Jeshurun on the Upper West Side. I particularly remember he sang \"Light One Candle\" in the sanctuary on the eve of the 2nd Gulf War. I also remember when Pete Seeger, Peter Yarrow and Dar Williams sang at a benefit to help John Hall try to win reelection as Congressman. Sadly, he lost. As Tom Lehrer wrote in his song \"Folk Song Army,\" \"They may have one all the battles, but we had all the best songs!\" I'm attaching 2 photos from October, 2010 of that benefit concert. One has Pete, Peter, Dar and John Hall. The other is of Peter Yarrow on stage solo. The few times I had an opportunity to meet him in person, I found him kind, gentle, soft-spoken and, well, a very nice man. ​ - David Block Dearest Peter. You have been a light in my life since the 1960s. My Mother would take me to see you with Mary and Paul. I grew up singing many of your songs. As an adult I was blessed to meet you on several occasions. For the first time David Roth and I went to see your last show with Mary at Carnegie Hall. We were invited to your apartment for an after show gathering. You were so welcoming. The second time I ran in to you at NYU Hospital. You were getting ready for a program there and I was visiting my ailing aunt. You saw I was crying, recognized me and you were so kind. The video I attached is from City Winery when you invited me and a handful of others to join you in Puff the Magic Dragon. I am so grateful for the gifts you have blessed our universe with on so many levels. As a retired special educator, I shared the Don’t Laugh at Me song and materials with my students. I want you to know how deeply you are loved by so many from multiple generations. May your transition be a gentle one surrounded and guided by love. Much love to you Dear Peter. xoxo.

Peter, Paul and Mary’s “Blowing in the Wind” Songbook was what I used to learn how to play my Aria. I adored PP&M. Bought all your albums. Your music, your message; the aura of the three of you who seemed completely imbued with love, kindness, honesty and a commitment to civil rights/social justice. I was enthralled. At thirteen, I saw you in concert at the California Chico State College and you lit an unrelenting fire under me to use Music and Love to make a difference in the world. In the early 70s I had the honor of being an opening act, along with John Fischer, for Noel Paul Stookey in Los Angeles. That initiated a lifelong musical banter and friendship. Noel later introduced me to you, Peter, and Mary at a concert you did in Nashville several years later. You were both so gracious. Through the years, I had numerous opportunities to perform & record with Noel, as well as to attend PP&M and then Noel & Peter performances after Mary’s passing. It is true that even though you were now a duo, I could “hear” Mary singing her inimitable part. Very mystical and moving. In 2017, I recorded an album called “Mangle the Tango” of my original songs except two. One was written by Noel Paul Stookey and Peter Yarrow – “The Very Last Day.” Peter, you, thrilled my heart by agreeing to sing a cameo part. “The Very Last Day” was one of the very first songs I learned to perform, so this was so special. It sounds so rich and powerful with your voice authenticating it's message! I've attached it for your listening pleasure! Thank you, Peter, for your life, your songs, your beautiful paintings, and your Love service to others. Thanks for Puff, Little Jackie Paper, Lemon Tree, The Very Last Day, The Great Mandala et al. – so many songs that I’ve listened to over and over. Some I’ve also learned and played over and over. You have touched and influenced so many people around the world. Thank you, for touching mine. You are so cherished, and I will always hold you dear. With Great Love & Respect, Pam Mark Hall I attended Camp Saratoga in the beautiful redwoods in Northern Cal each summer from 1966-1971. In those days, the kids from Southern Cal arrived after sunset because we all took the (now defunct) \"Dayliner\" from Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. When the van arrived at camp, we were brought to the \"Evening Friendship Circle\" already in progress, and songleaders with guitars leading everyone in \"Leaving on a Jet Plane\", \"The Great Mandela\", etc etc. \"Marvelous Toy\", \"Puff\" and so many others became favorites. The years at camp were my most formative and inextricably linked to what became the soundtrack of our lives, and Peter, you were and still are so central to what was then an anti-Vietnam war message but with every heartfelt uplifting lyric, a belief in humanity that continues to resonate today & forever! I have added so many PPM albums to Spotify so even in 2024, I am in awe listening to the brilliance and humanity of Album 1700. Thank you, thank you for the beauty and timelessness of all your music. It still makes me cry, it is so beautiful! Yours is a life incredibly well-lived!!!! Thank you for sharing your heart and your genius with us all. Be at peace!!! ​ - Gwynneth Russler Dear Peter, Your music has been a fixture in my life as far back as I can remember. I was an infant when my parents bought me the “Peter, Paul and Mommy Too” cassette and lyric book. I still cherish it more than thirty years later; “Inside” was always my favorite. It reminded me of the benefits to seeing people as they are, which was a great comfort to me as a disabled person. At age 6, I went to Ravinia with my mom and aunt to see PP&M– a tradition we maintained until I was 18. One year, we even nearly had a chance encounter with you! That same year, I first heard you sing “Don’t Laugh At Me”. The song was there at the moment I needed it, and for many moments after. A few years after that, I first heard “Weave Me the Sunshine”. I was again struck by strong feelings of kismet. That song has been a favorite since, there when I need cheering up and when I am already glad. I felt the kismet yet again, this past year. I had the good fortune to finally attend a “Peter and Paul” with my husband, as well as my mom and aunt. As the lights dimmed in Waukegan, IL– a block away from my first house– you played the first notes to “Weave Me the Sunshine”. I had not even dared to hope it would be sung, let alone first. And then, you stopped the song to teach the entire audience the words! I was stunned, again it was as if the moment was just for me. I will not soon forget it, nor any of the other hundreds of memories I have associated with your music. So, thank you Peter. Thank you for helping so many people with your music, exactly when we needed it. ​ - Hannah Stoltz Dearest Peter, It seems so wrong not to be present with you during this time, as you, unknowingly have been present with me through so many parts of my life. Why didn't I ever think before to send you a note of gratitude? Well, actually I did thank you, Paul and Mary at one of Mary's last concerts at the Britt in Oregon. She was quite unhappy with her performance so a gushing woman probably wasn't helpful. But for me, it was heaven to be in your presence singing along with the music that means so much to me. You helped me bond with my older siblings as we would play our records in the basement and sing along through my adolescence. To this day, 60 years later, we only have to start singing \"Puff\" and we are transported to that time. We will always belt out “IF I had a hammer”! My brother bought the PP&M album for me for Christmas and I played it when I was sad or happy or full of teenage angst. I have treasured it, Album 1700 and my others forever and even learned to play guitar a bit because of your music. At age 70 the songs continue to be a part of my own heart’s repertoire. I grew to have a pretty serious social conscience because of the message in the songs. They helped form my belief that we can make a difference in this world. Puff was a favorite lullaby for my own children and then my grandchildren. Day is Done, Weave Me the Sunshine and so many more are indelibly etched in my heart and those of my family. You likely will never know the many lives that you have touched in a most perfect and profound way. I hope you will take some comfort in the extended legacy that you leave whenever we make a joyful noise along with your meaningful lyrics and heartfelt melodies. Folk music always has been and always will be my favorite because it tells us stories and helps us to be better. As for you, well your voice is like warm cocoa on a cold day. It just wraps us in comfort, kindness and acceptance. Thank you, Peter. Your legacy will live in us as an \"infinity gift\" as my grandkids might say. Wishing you the same comfort you have provided to me and my family. ​ - Margaret Beck Peter Yarrow is in his final days. I can’t begin to say how profoundly his music has touched my life and the lives of so many. The trio of Peter, Paul, and Mary not only brought joy and inspiration but has also been a powerful voice for justice, peace, and humanity. Songs like “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “If I Had a Hammer” remain timeless reminders of the strength of community and the possibility of change when people unite. His music has been a guide for those who seek a kinder, more compassionate world. His voice is a beautiful gift and has inspired generations. In 1981 or so I remember playing Blowing in the Wind at a nuclear arms protest on my college campus. My nephew was weaned on Puff the Magic Dragon as were many campers around campfires. ​ - Kathleen Murray In 2013, our 4 year old grandson was suffering from an immune deficiency which required the cure of a stem cell transplant from a matching donor.. He did eventually find his match and the stem cell transplant was a complete success. He is a thriving teenager. It was during that search for a donor that Peter volunteered his time and talent. It was a Sunday morning in early spring of that year that we saw Peter appear on a news program and Peter said that he would be performing at a bookstore that afternoon in Maplewood, NJ. We ran down to the bookstore and as Peter walked in, I (Mark) grabbed his hand and said I need your help. Peter said speak to me after the event, which we did. We explained our grandson's condition and the quest for locating a donor match. Karen showed Peter a video of our grandson singing Puff. Peter asked how he could help and we brazenly asked if he could perhaps perform a benefit concert. Peter did not miss a beat and simply said, you set up the venue and I will be there. We secured the venue in Manhattan and in May 2013 Peter performed as promised to a very large crowd of our relatives and friends. Last year we had the opportunity to meet with Peter at a concert Peter and Bethany performed at the Town Crier in Beacon, NY. We reminded Peter of his generosity and how much it meant to us. We showed him pictures from that concert. He was indeed very touched when we told him that our grandson was fully cured and thriving. As life long fans of PP&M, nothing can compare emotionally to Peter's generosity of spirit. We will forever be grateful. We pray that his final passage be peaceful. With love and appreciation. Karen and Mark Lefkowitz I met Peter by chance one morning several years ago while waiting for a plane at LaGuardia airport. I was at the gate a bit early, and closed my eyes to meditate, and when I opened them, I saw an elderly man walking down the corridor with a determined gait, and a guitar slung on his back. I said to myself: “ That’s Peter Yarrow, and there’s no one accompanying him.” He looked as if he was unsure about exactly where he should be to catch his flight. I went up to Peter and introduced myself as a longtime fan, and asked if I could be of some assistance. He was so thankful, kind, and gracious. As it turned out, we were on the same flight to Chicago, and he was going on after that to play at a rally in South Dakota, ever championing those in need. When we got off the plane in Chicago, I saw as I passed his row that he was fast asleep. I gently woke him and explained that we had to deplane, and offered to get his guitar out of the overhead bin and carry it for him. “ Thank you, my friend” he said, and I thought I should be thanking him, for letting me be the wing man to my folk hero, for even a brief period of time. ​ - Gary Kaplan I got my first Peter Paul and Mary album when I was 8 years old right when it came out I learned every song on it. A few years later I was in the studio video taping a social drama and Peter Paul and Mary were in the next studio they were recording Peter's you are what you eat and I ran over when they took a break and got a quick hug from everybody. Then a few years later I started going to the Kerrville folk festival and Peter was there almost every year I was for over a decade and I worked in the office doing triage and I got to see him interacting with everybody and he was especially kind and gentle with the kids and the kids did concerts and threadgill theater I will love and be grateful to him forever for being such a wonderful part of my life, and still my favorite music. Blessings to you, dear Peter, and when the angels sing you to your rest, may you rejoice in being with all who have gone before. ​ - Cathy Gould Brother Peter, You were my childhood, and you were my daughter’s childhood. We are 60 & 35, and your songs were probably the first I heard, and followed suit with my daughter. We sang your songs in the bus on Field trips, we sang them at camp, and I always knew Puff was real. I took my family and relatives to see the mighty three at Westbury Music Fair, many years ago, and I’m so glad I did. What a night! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for sharing your gifts with us…you’ve changed our lives, and hope we sufficiently let you know how much we loved you, and hope you felt it, and feel the love now. May your days be filled with beauty, friends, family, and so much love….Love Christine & Katie Peter had an enormous influence on my life. I know I'm only one of millions. I was in high school when I went to my first concert. It was Peter, Paul and Mary. I was just learning to appreciate the Folk tradition and this is the music I've revered my whole life. A couple years later, in college I saw PP&M. After the show, Peter spoke to many of us who stayed after. He spoke of peace and the importance of educating ourselves and being active. I took it to heart. He autographed my draft card. I've been inspired by his legacy of peace, love and persistence. His music is a gift that will live forever. Go in peace, Peter. Thank you. - Jim Hasenauer Peter, When i heard about your health battle, the words “ if only i could heal your sorrow, shine on me again “ came to my heart - the touch of sorrow was not just from knowing what you are going thru physically, but how you were hurting because you couldn't sing live and strong as always and get others singing along. i knew i could pray, and have been praying for you and your family since as you climb that mountain. May you find Comfort on the hillside, where the Shepherd is tending his sheep. I heard you in 1970 in Kansas City , and wore out two 8 tracks of 10 Years Together. I think i have been to each concert you and PP&M have done in this area. We met in the mid 90’s at one concert. Noel was performing a solo time and we bumped into each other as you were walking around the “house” seeing how the sound was. We talked about the sound and listened in various places in the Theatre. We discussed things about life and social issues going on and spiritual things, and it was truly meaningful. We both agreed the sound was really good that night. Thank you for taking the time-when you could have been focused on other things , to include me in your “ sound check” and engage me. A kindness i will never forget. I have seen the brotherhood you and Noel have lived out all these years and it is wonderful and an inspiration. Prayers and gratitude, Dan Newby Peter, I am sending you huge love and gratitude. My mom and Dad, Midge & Syd Weiss, were organizers. In fact, my dad was a political cartoonist and drew political cartoons during WWII, the Korean & Vietnam wars. They met in the early 50's at a rally for \"integration\" and equity in NYC. I remember growing up in our house to your music... especially singing about the 1915 organizer, Joe Hill, who was killed for organizing. \"I dreamt I saw Joe Hill last night; alive as you and me. Said I to Joe, 'you're ten years dead'. \"I didn't die' cried he. I didn't die cried he.\" Peter your protest songs, Joe Hill, If I had a Hammer... and, of course your love songs... Don't Think Twice & of course, Leaving on a Jet Plane. What a gift for our world. Powerful, Beautiful, Touching! Thank you!!!! Love & more love! Jody How can you thank someone who has been one of the best parts of your life since you were a child? Long before Peter was a neighbor, I grew up with PP&M songs as part of the soundtrack of my life. I remember the day that Miss Toone, my high school Creative Writing teacher, basically suspended class and played the entire first PP&M LP for us. After that, it was a different world. Finishing my schooling, I went and hid out from the real world in a little, almost unknown Rocky Mountain town in Colorado, Telluride. t was such a delight when Peter moved to town and continued to spread music, his smile, and optimism to the rest of the world. Thank you Peter, for a lifetime of music and happiness. Many blessing to you from me and from all your friends. ​ - Jim Bedford Dear Peter, I was born in 1954 so I consider myself to be a middling baby boomer who began his coming of age process in the 60's. Considering my demographics I was one of those people who have known Puff, The Magic Dragon, my whole life. As a fledgling folkie on of the first songs I learned was This Train and I learned it from Peter, Paul and Mary. I learned the songs of Dylan, Guthrie, Paxton and so many others from P,P&M. You and your trio mates have been with me my whole life as a guiding force in my own song writing and performance and I am eternally grateful for that. That influence brought me to The SongSchool, in Lyons Colorado for the first time in 2010, where our mutual friend Steve Seskin has guided me for many years. In 2015 I brought my daughter Molly for her first SongSchool and Steve brought you. Molly and I both attended you workshop that year and sat right there in the very first row right in the front row of chairs. The subject was songs of protest and social justice that could adjust and adapt to many issues and situations there by carrying on for years if not decades, dare I say centuries, becoming generationally traditional songs that embody the power of song. You gave us a prompt and 15 minutes to write. My paper stayed blank, writer's block, but Molly wrote furiously and when the 15 minutes were up and you asked if anyone would care to share her had was up in a flash and she joined you in front of the group to share with you and us what she had written. I that moment I realized how the goal of your prompt and been achieved. I sat there listening with tears in my eyes as my 19 year old daughter stood there with you, one of my all time heros, and sang her song. When you graciously complemented her work she body offered to play you more and you graciously invited her back to the green room in the Wildflower Pavilion to share them. You even offered her your guitar to play. It was a moment I will never forget and one of the most thrilling moments of my parenting life. A few years later you came to Park City to perform and again Steve Seskin was there as I had helped him bring his Kids Write Songs to your local Schools that week. During the course of the evening you asked the audience to join you on stage to sing Puff The Magic Dragon and of course Molly and I were up in a flash. Most of the kids on stage that night were 10 years or younger with their Moms holding their hands so that put Molly and I closest to you in age. We stood right next to you on the stage at the Egyptian that night so we were closest to you physically as well. Chris was with you that night playing his washtub bass and we all sang as if the fate of the world depended on it. In that moment I flashed back to my six year old self hearing Puff for the first time. Now nearly 60 years later I was on a stage singing the song with you and you son and my daughter (and Steve of course) The power of a song written for the generations struck me full force. The wonder, magic and power of Puff had come full circle for me and been passed onto my daughter who continues to write powerful songs and deliver magical performances. I know for certain that Dragons do not live forever and you my friend are certainly a Magic Dragon but your roar will continue forever as will your songs and spirit. Thanks for the music, the inspiration and most of all the magic. Give my love to Mary when you get to the other side. ​ - Bill McGinnis Where to begin? Peter’s music and beautiful soft spirit captured my attention at an early age. The music he made in Peter, Paul & Mary was particularly captivating! Their harmony singing, tonal blend, musical and lyrical excellence was bound to live on for centuries. The first time I heard Puff The Magic Dragon I was transported to a place of fantasy and imagination. The imagery and lilting musical accompaniment was particularly thrilling. Being a professional musician myself, this music inspired me in my singer/songwriter journey and I am forever grateful for the tremendous impact Peter has had on me. I will forever remember this beautiful man. Thank you Peter! ​ - Michael Dwyer Dear Peter, I've been thinking about you everyday and am recalling when I first moved out to Los angeles. I was fortunate to stay with you Mary Beth,and. the kids for a while to help out . I enjoyed driving around with you to different events, and was always in awe of your constant energy and ability to bring the best out of people for whatever cause you were trying to raise money or awareness for. People seemed to gravitate to that love and energy. It is a special power. I'm sending you that strength now as you keep the strength and unwavering love.Keep pushing on my friend! There will always be Puff and Jacky but to me you are the King of the muffin stuffins!! all my love to you!! Stay strong. Kenny Lehn Peter Yarrow is a treasure in this troubled world. You have touched my heart as few others have done, with your music, your kindness, your service and your very being. Your music is the soundtrack of my life. Often moving me to tears with its poignancy. Always feeling like I’m experiencing true genius and the best that humankind can be. I had the privilege of attending several concerts by Peter, Paul and Mary. I have had the honor of meeting you several times, through your generous benefits in Portland, Oregon for Oregon Public Broadcasting and in Corvallis, Oregon for your house concerts for One Story at a Time. You treat each person you meet as a long-lost friend and radiate to them love and compassion. You make me want to be a better person, to strive for justice and to live life to its fullest. ​ - Yvonne Morse I first \"met\" Peter Yarrow by being a teenage fan of Peter, Paul and Mary, and could sing and play all their songs, and loved them and what they stood for. Many years later I learned of Peter's activism as he became friends with and a supporter of my father, Harris Wofford. A very special member was Peter coming to sing at the wedding celebration for my father and his newly wedded husband Matthew Charlton. Singing underneath a tent in Nantucket near our house at the ocean, he added joy and depth to the celebration. I know my father was deeply touched that Peter made the trip and valued the community gathered so much to be willing to come and sing. Thank you Peter for your music which has filled my life since early days, and thank you on behalf of my father for your support for service in so many different forms. ​ - Susanne Wofford When I was in 5th grade, with my close friends we played we were Peter, Paul and Mary. We loved their music and it encouraged us to learn guitar and sing in harmony. I never imagined that 30 years later, Peter would become a mentor, friend and long-term supporter of our work at EPES (Educación Popular en Salud) in Chile to promote health, justice and dignity. In the mid-1990s, Peter visited EPES and we had an amazing afternoon with him talking with the community health promoters as he intently listening to their stories. Since then, he and Bethany have generously done many fundraising events for EPES in NY, MN and Portland.Their music always lifts our spirits and gives us hope. Peter guided us in our first efforts and taught us a lot about fundraising. Everyone at EPES is profoundly grateful for his love and support. Peter – we love and admire you! Your spirit, your solidarity, your music, your consecuencia and your generosity are such incredible gifts for so many people and movements. We thank you and we send our love, prayers and healing energy. Abrazos, Karen Anderson In the 60's my Mom surprised my Sister, Brother and I with our first concert - Peter, Paul & Mary - in San Francisco. It was a life changing evening. Your voices, musicianship, and stories kept us mesmorized. Mary hugged my Sister for her birthday. We began following your careers, and embraced your passions. I learned guitar and played gigs locally during high school & college - half the songs PP&M's. Your passion for our military inspired me to begain writing letters to \"Any Soldier\" in Vietnam - which continued until everyone was home. I'm still in touch with my favorite - almost married him. I owe 2 decades of love, enlightenment, and involvement to you, Mary and Noel. Thank you. ​ - Kathi Ramirez I met PPM in when I was 5 years old, in 1978, at Tanglewood. My mother was a big fan, so she walked me to the stage after the show and Peter held me in his arms and sang a bit of the Marvelous Toy to me. Years later, I called pbs to during a telethon and was fortunate to speak with him again. I told him how my young children were now enjoying their. A third generation of fans.In 2017, I saw Peter and Paul at the Cabot Theater in Beverly, MA. After a wonderful show, we went back to our hotel and bumped into them in the lobby! Peter sat with us, took photos and even sang a few lines for me from The Marvelous Toy for a full circle moment! I love you, Peter. I am praying for you and will be forever grateful for your music, kindness and joy. Thank you. You have woven us the sunshine. ​ - Leigh Sasen Dear sweet Peter. I am so blessed to have personally met you and spent time with you backstage at Wolf Trap In Virginia, Andand The after show late dinners that you so graciously hosted for your friends. It is definitely a highlight of my life to have sung with you on the millennial stage at the Kennedy Center as well as on Capitol Hill while you were promoting the don’t laugh at me program. I was proud to be able to help you on behalf of NASSP. I also remember when Beverly Baughman and I accompanied you to the Met for an Opera and then later out to dinner. It was nice to have an intimate family dinner with you, Bethany, and Mary Beth at a neighborhood Italian restaurant. So many memories ! Peter , you have touched my life and millions of other people as well with your passion, fight for justice, educating our children to not bully. And your wonderful music . Sending you me much love! Beverly Coney Hello! Jonathan Moorehead here. A few years back I was on the film crew for a CBS Cares PSA commercial starring the delightful Peter Yarrow. The subject of this public service ad was colonoscopies. It's a very good cause of course, but as you might imagine, the jokes among the crew and production were gloriously ribald. Peter was so very warm, engaged, approachable and kind to everyone. Having worked in both the music and film/television realms, I've seen my share of celebrities, and Peter Yarrow was one of the most down-to-earth, genuine, congenial and affable souls I have ever encountered onstage or on set. After the shoot, we were all having such a good time hanging out and chatting with him, his handlers had to nudge him, to peel him away from us. Attached is the link to the commercial, made with my dear pals at Red Thread Productions. https://youtu.be/JqvpfrnmJrg?si=HFZG6aSELMmwj75W When I first laid eyes on Peter in the green room, I was frozen in my place. He walked over to me and said, \"Hello, I am Uncle Peter, what's your name\"? I managed to get my name to leave my mouth and croaked, I am Millie Davis and I am singing a song today\". I have been a Hospice RN casemanager for 25 years. But have been playing guitar and singing my whole life. I am sad to learn that Peter Yarrow is nearing the end of his. He, the talented songwriter who wrote the classic song, Puff the Magic Dragon. This photo was taken 10 years ago after Robert Zucker gave me an amazing opportunity to open Peter's concert in Higley AZ in it's beautiful auditorium. Bob requested that I play the song, Hallelujah and I was thrilled, but nervous. My dear, now deceased friend, Al Catarino, agreed to do some lead work with me on that stage, to calm my nerves. After it was done, Peter hugged me so tightly, spilled his coffee on me, and to my delight, told me that it was the best rendition he'd ever heard. My words were, \"Wow, ok, I can die now.\" I will never forget that feeling. Wow, I floated off the ground for a long time. What a kind man! We talked about world peace among other things. I am really sad to hear that he is leaving us. ​ - Millie Gollinger Davis I was lucky enough to be born in 1960 so grew up through the best decades in music, and you were a big part of that. In 1980 my college roommate and I were lucky enough to budget for and score tickets to your concert at the Strand in Pittsburgh and it was, in every way possible, the best concert I have ever attended. You guys made it a shared experience. It was not a passive sit back and be entertained night. When the mike was held out to the audience while we sang the chorus of Puff and the three of you quietly listened I felt a bond with strangers that I have never felt before or since, and we need that in the world. You inspired us that night. Inspired us to create that feeling of love and acceptance for as many others as we can. I lost her to cancer a few years back, in fact I am the only one left out of the four of us who lived, loved, and laughed together at college, but I carry the hopes and dreams your songs and performances inspired in all of us. I will never touch the world the way you have, but you taught me that that is ok, as long as I stretch out my arms and accept and love those that I can. Thank you. Thank you for being a part of my life, and the lives of my children as they grew up listening to your records and hearing their mother sing your songs. Thank you for being who you are and without even realizing it, making me the woman I am. I first experienced PP&M live at Melbourne's Festival Hall in the late 1960s I had bought and resold 203 tickets to university students, all of us trainee teachers in residence. What a night of great music, strong values and messages and a desire for a better world. I was back the next night and after that I never missed a PP&M concert in Melbourne and one in Adelaide!!!!! I often sat front row dead centre to enjoy the magic that was THE folk group of the period. And that was because you all sang (and spoke) of the issues that affected us all and espoused human rights that society at large shunned. At one of those last Melbourne concerts I went with a dear friend who was not as enthusiastic a PP&M fan as I but she thoroughly enjoyed the night, remarking during Peter's solo, 'he's the ultimate committed musician'. Your music and your politics always spoke louder than words. Thank you all for opening our eyes to the need for change and a better world. May the Lord bless you as we thank you for your musicianship and social justice commitments. We are the richer for experiencing you, Noel Paul and Mary. ​ - John Andrews Hi Peter, this is Heather Ford from Trenton, Maine. I grew up listening to you on the albums my parents had. We had no radio in the first few cars we owned as kids so my dad taught us Bamboo and Puff, and all the songs from the records. Then when we knew the melody he would take some harmonies, usually yours because he was a tenor. When we got older, all three of us would take a part. So many wonderful memories of your voice and my dad’s together for hours in the car. I stuttered as a child except when I was singing, and I am so thankful for the musical ear training and breath control I learned to stop stuttering. I am now a singer and have had the opportunity to sing with Noel a few times. Unfortunately, I have never had the privilege of meeting you. Your clear perfect pitch tenor voice is in my mind and soul forever. Thank you for the music Paul. Say hi to Gary Hill in heaven, he knows all the songs! Thanks for enriching my life. Your forever friend in Music, Heather Hill Ford. Hi, Peter! It’s been more than 55 years since we first met. You were walking alone on the street of Ginza in Tokyo. I found you and bravely said hello and you were so friendly and asked me to find an antique shop. A superstar was walking alone looking for some woodblock prints for Mary! Since then we got together whenever PPM came to Tokyo to have concerts. I met Marybeth when she was pregnant of Bethany. Bethany came to Tokyo when she was 9 or 10 year-old?who used to be crazy for electronics games. Christopher and I went to Kamakura, one our trip from Tokyo, to see the big Buddha. These were precious moments of my life. I learned a lot from Peter and Mary. They were my heroes. And still are they. Love you Peter. Thank you for your friendship. I miss you. We will cherish your songs and voice forever. ​ - Mari Sugimoto As a young progressive in the 1970s, I was sorely disappointed when my peers had lapsed into the apathetic do-nothingness of the Me generation. With five older siblings who had joined the civil rights and anti-war movements, I was excited to do my part. In the ninth grade, I discovered that my Reform Jewish synagogue had always been and was still passionate about social justice. Your music dominated the soundtrack of their calls to justice, kindness and compassion. In 1982, as I entered rabbinical school, you released \"Light One Candle\" and reminded me that Peter, Paul and Mary would never ceased agitating for peace, AND that you understood how Judaism's message was consonant with yours. Both have inspired and nudged me through the decades. Thank you for being part of my life's and my rabbinate's soundtrack of decency and integrity. ​ - Billy Dreskin Peter was the featured speaker at the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences in Dallas Texas. As the entrepreneur of Learning ZoneXpress I sponsored Peter to speak. I went to the Avis car rental and said I have a VIP to chauffeur and the agent said WHO is your special guest. Peter Yarrow. The agent was so excited as he had been on the Selma Bridge with Peter, Paul and Mary, March 1965 for the Selma Protest and Bloody Sunday where non-violent activists highlighted racial injustice. March 15, Lyndon B Johnson asked lawmakers to pass the Voting Rights Amendment of 1965. Thank you Peter for all you have done for racial justice! ​ - Melanie Nelson Dear Peter~ We listened to all your music growing up. Such a beautiful lesson in consciousness and caring... the best voices, the most perfect harmonies. There has been no one like you since. When my youngest son Nicky was very small, he had to use a nebulizer for asthma, and we called it \"Puff\". But the memory that stays with me most, was after the death of my beloved youngest brother, Sam in 2012. In 4 months, pancreatic cancer took him at 45... in his last days as I drove to and from the hospital, your music was my soundtrack... to my loss, to his death, to my deep love for my brother. You and Paul's son played a small venue near our home in Massachusetts later that year, and my husband brought me. You called people to the stage to sing Puff with you, and I was standing next to you and told you of how much your music and voice were a part of saying goodbye to my brother Sam. You hugged me and said something so kind, and we all sang the music to that beloved song and it was one of the most piercingly beautiful moments in my memory. Thank you for that. I have a photo of it somewhere. During these political times, I have often wished that you and Paul and Mary were together singing about it, joining us all in song and opening our hearts in the ways I remember from growing up in the 60s. I wish you every blessing on your journey and peace in these last days. You touched so many and you surely touched me and I am grateful. I hope you read all of these loving words and that it nourishes you for the journey ahead. With so much love, lisa grew up watching and listening to Peter, Paul, and Mary. Beautiful music! I saw them perform many times - in concert and at protest rallies. I did not meet Peter in person until, I believe, in January 2009 when he performed at Busboys & Poets in Washington, DC on the occasion of Barack Obama’s first inauguration. My favorite memory of Peter as a person was in about 2018 or 2019 when he was performing at a protest in Washington DC. I was walking and talking with him as a group of us went out to dinner. I held his arm as he seemed to be struggling to walk. I told him about an experience I had on a bus in August 1963 from the Chicago area to a Jewish summer camp in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. Someone was strumming a guitar and singing a song: “Blowing in the Wind” - a big hit that summer. I was 16 years old. A girl about my age said: “I know who wrote that song. I went to his Bar Mitzvah in Hibbing, Minnesota: Bobby Zimmerman. In February 2016, I was in a bookstore in Santa Fe, New Mexico. There was a big book with the history of every song written by the recent winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature - Bob Dylan. According to the book, he wrote the song in April 1962, he recorded it in July 1962 and he officially changed his name to Bob Dylan in August 1962. So the girl was right - Bobby Zimmerman wrote that song. As I recounted this to Peter Yarrow he said: “You know Bob Dylan and his girlfriend lived with us in Woodstock during the summer of 1963.” I was in Oconomowoc a few days later when I saw and heard on television- Peter, Paul and Mary singing Blowing in the Wind on August 28, 1963 in front of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington. I wish the best to Peter as he battles his illness. Peace and Love! Stephen Lincoln Spitz - born on February 12 in Chicago. Dear Peter, Since I was a small child, I have been a devoted fan of Peter, Paul and Mary. From wearing out several VHS tapes of the Holiday and the 25th Anniversary Concerts as I played along as a small child, to learning more about the work of the trio and you in important moments of social change throughout the decades, to say that you have been a great inspiration to me would be an understatement. Now, as a professional musician and arts administrator I carry my love for your music and profound admiration for your work ethic, which I have recognized in many ways, with me every day. I have had the opportunity to see you perform many times - most recently in Lexington, Massachusetts on October 1 of 2023 and want you to know how grateful I am for you. I am thinking of you and your family in this time and wanted to express that, even though we never had the opportunity to meet, you have had a profound impact on my life. Thank you and much love, Garrett Hi Peter, I'm writing to you from a hotel room here in \"The Villages\" near Orlando, FL...I'm in the current configuration of The Kingston Trio, we just played Key West yesterday -- attaching a photo of a very fine rooster I made friends with outside a little Cuban cafe we had lunch at before flying to Orlando -- and I just heard that you were in hospice care. I've got this job because my parents gave up their Peter, Paul & Mary, Kingston Trio and Limeliters albums to my \"education\" and eventual job as a picker and harmony-singer, something I can attribute directly to sitting in front of the record player and going over the individual parts for Samson & Delilah over and over and over...and OVER. In other words, I'm here largely because of you. The second photo I'm attaching is of the nasty motel staircase up which I had to lug my bags and instruments -- TO THE THIRD FLOOR u-- sbmitted, you know, just in case you have any actual *regrets* about not being on the road presently ;) I wish I'd had a chance to sing with you (other than on vinyl). I have so much I want to tell you, and you have SO many other messages to get to, so I will sign off wishing you all the love, comfort and peace I've gotten from silently joining voices with you whenever I needed to fill up the tank. Love, Buddy Woodward, The Kingston Trio Dear Peter, I think it must have been 2012 when we met. I was experiencing pretty severe burn-out working on environmental issues in DC and wanted to figure out how to bring music into the climate movement. I met Bethany first and then you and the rest of the family. I wanted to learn how you and your collaborators did what you did in the civil rights movement and apply it to the climate fight. You were very generous with you time and experience. I remember sitting in your kitchen in Manhattan for hours furiously taking notes, trying to capture it all. Start small! Do something together and do it well. And celebrate your shared success! Then do something slightly bigger. And when you succeed again, celebrate your success. We are human after all. And sing. Everyone must sing. Together. There’s something about the magic that happens when people do the simple act of singing together. You were very clear that this isn’t listening to someone else sing. Everyone has to sing. Together. It’s about the collective experience. It’s about the feeling of that shared experience. That magical invisible weaving that happens as we raise our voices and lower our defenses. The alchemy of your life, at least the small part that I got to see, has been to transform such sweet, soft human experiences into hard political power. In sharing that which is most basic we build that which is most elevated. It is a lesson that can take lifetimes to learn, but music is an accelerant. A conduit. And you channeled its energy to important ends. You’ve taught your kids and countless others to do what needs to be done. Tirelessly. Even when it is just so damn hard. Over the years, some of my favorite memories of you have to do with both this ability to do what is just so incredibly hard, and your wicked sense of humor. That first Unity Concert in the Black Hills that we organized together was a perfect example of both. Thanks to complete physical and emotional exhaustion, I ended up with full blown sinus and lung infections. I was standing, but barely when I saw you arrive. In my feverish head I thought I’d get words of encouragement, or solace from you, but you pulled me in for a hug and whispered in my ear, “you got any other bright ideas kid?”. I think I nearly coughed up a lung laughing. That was also the first time I ever experienced a public apology by a prominent white American for the atrocities our government perpetrated against Native Americans. We are not a nation that knows how to apologize. But you demonstrated how it should be done. That it can be done. With grace. Do the hard things with music. With others. Together. And they’re not as hard as they seem. Many would probably say that you have a strong moral compass. But a compass seems lightweight for you. You’ve also lived your life with a moral keel. A massive weight deep in the water that has kept you on course through the storms and the changing tides and the intermittent darkness. I don’t know how to thank you for all that you’ve taught me, and for the gift of your family’s friendship. We will keep struggling together. Celebrating our successes together. And most importantly. We will keep singing together. Love love love always, Suzanne Dear Mr. Yarrow, First of all, let me thank you for all the beautiful music you have given to the world. We are all so much better off because of it. Secondly, I would like to tell you a special story of how one of your songs deeply affected my family (I'm sure you can imagine which one.) The story starts with my Grandpa, a man named Bruce Heverly who loved the Adirondack mountains and a good folk tune. One of his favorite songs to play was Puff the Magic Dragon. He instilled this same love of music and mountains into my mother and me alike. He passed away in March of 2023 and around the same time I found out I was going to have a baby. I was able to share the news with him shortly before he passed. My son, Sammy, was born October 19th 2023. Poor Sammy was a colic baby, crying day and night. Nothing we tried could make it better, until one fateful day in November when he was just about one month old. I was missing my Grandpa and playing some of his favorite songs. Puff the Magic Dragon came on and for the first time ever, something seemed to help Sammy calm down. I wondered if it was just a fluke, but with time we discovered that he was calmed immediately upon hearing that song. It seems impossible that a one month old would have a favorite song, but this was surely the case. Thank you, Mr. Yarrow, for bringing such peace to our home in a difficult time with your music. Not only did it calm our little one, it will be a link he will always have to his Great Grandpa Heverly. Your music will live on for generations to come because these connections are what we all live for and need in our lives. What a beautiful thing for you to leave for us in this world. Bless you, Mr. Yarrow, and may you feel all the peace and love you've given come back to you now. ​ - Lydia Hazleton I have so many fond memories of all the shows we did with you Peter. You were always so kind to me and had me feel like part of the family. The greatest experience was traveling to Hong Kong to spend a week there and do shows with you, Noel and Mary. Something I will never forget and cherish the memories. However if I were to recall one experience that defined you it would be a show we were doing in San Antonio with the trio. Noel had missed a connecting flight and it appeared that he may not make the show. It was just a few minutes before doors were to open and we were frantically trying to figure out whether we cancel or postpone. You were insistent on making the show work for the fans. So when we found out that Noel would be about an hour late for the show, you rearranged the set and you and Mary would play some songs and do some solos prior to Noel's arrival. Since everything was delayed you weren't able to do a sound check, and now the auditorium was full. So you calmly walked out on stage by yourself, explained the situation to the audience and said before we start you need to do a sound check. Then you and Mary began the show. The \"show must go on\" was alive and well. And the audience were treated to a most memorable night! Much love to you Peter. You have touched so many people with your songs. A true legend. Terry Burke As I was born in 1961, my memories of the very early Peter, Paul & Mary are, to say the least, minimal. By my pre-school years, with my mom in charge of the record player, I knew all of your music, and very proudly sung them out LOUD for everyone within hearing distance. While, as a child I didn’t understand the causes or the meaning behind the lyrics, the beauty of them was undeniable, even to a child. As an adult, I fell in love with your music all over again, this time understanding the meaning of the lyrics. I was very lucky to gain control of the tape deck / cd player at my home, and my daughter grew up loving PP&M. In the early 90’s, I was able to take her to a PP&M concert, and for a long time afterward, kept only y’all playing in the car as we drove. Even now, if the word “puff” comes up in any conversation, my almost 40-yo daughter will break out into Puff the Magic Dragon. In 2016, I was able to snag front row tickets to take my mother to see Peter and Noel in Galveston, Texas, and was thrilled to be the one in the audience that Peter lightly flirted with. The light bow and blown kiss my way at the end of the concert brings a smile to me any time I think of you. As you’ve taught us, dragons live forever, but not so little boys. But that is in the physical sense only. You will still be with us, sharing your music. Many generations of us love your music, and will sing it with generations yet to come. ​ - Melody May We are a Brazilian family of four, mother, father, and two boys. In 2012 we lost our daughter and went to the underworld. In our desperation, we sought ways out. What we decided was to honor our daughter by social initiatives, donations, deeds in her name. We decided to donate a library to the Arab Jewish Community Center in Jaffa, Tel Aviv, where children from all creeds could work and play together. And so we did. We invited Peter Yarrow to go to Israel for the inauguration and he immediately accepted. He was there with us on October 15, 2015 , sang songs, honored our daughter, and donated his name, image, and energy to raise the occasion. Today, the library is one of the most visited in the whole country and one of the only seeking to unite different people in these difficult times. Our sincere appreciation! Anna Laura (in memoriam), Arthur, Felipe, Claudia & Rudi Fischer Peter, Peter, Peter. This is Rosa and Stan. I am writing first because Rosa is on a train to Washington to take the front lines in slaying the dragons that are roaming and already causing so much damage. Peter, Paul and Mary joyfully supporting Rosa in that first election. That started a lifetime of Peter and Rosa battling arm and arm to push back darkness and bring in light. Rosa helped defeat Contra Aid, join Lily Leadbetter to pass equal pay and passed the Child Tax Credit that cut child poverty in half. Peter is forever a hopeless optimist. And we share our closest, dear friend, Anthony, for a lifetime. If you scratch the surface of any of us who lived through the civil right era, your music is woven through. I grew up in Washington while the schools were being desegregated. I saw you perform every summer at Carter Barron, volunteered at the NAACP and was in the organizing tent at the March on Washington, while you were singing at the Lincoln Memorial. I spent a decade fighting apartheid and was pollster for Nelson Mandela. These notes to you will bring out the millions of places you shape our world for the better. We love you, Rosa and Stan Peter Yarrow, Mary Travers, and Noel Paul Stookey have been my heroes since they hit the music scene in the early sixties. I first saw them in concert in Portland, Oregon, in 1968, while they were also in town campaigning for Eugene McCarthy. Since then, I have seen Peter. and or P, P&M approximately 45 times throughout the country. I also have my tickets for the upcoming concert at the Cerritos Performing Arts Center in California. Besides his music, I have been inspired by Peter's example of activism and humanity. My life continues to be influenced in many ways by P,P&M. Thank you, Peter, for all you have done for me, and for so many people and causes around the world. May God comfort and sustain you at this time. Thom M. Armstrong. Ph.D. Claremont, California I sent the following e-mail to the Kennedy Center Honors this past week. I urge everyone else do the same ASAP. Mary Travers died of Cancer in 2006, Peter Yarrow was still performing until earlier this year, and now at 86 has cancer and has cancelled the rest of his tour with Paul Stockey. They started touring in 1961 and performed at the MLK March on Washington I 1963. They have been in front of Civil and Human rights movement from day one, more so than any living group in our history. They walked with Ceaser, Martin, Dolores, Betty and Gloria. The Group deserves recognition and with the possible passing of Peter Yarrow, leaving only Paul to represent the Voice of the Civil Rights Movement, the Kennedy Honors now more than ever would be a fitting tribute to their work which goes back 65 years. It would be very important if Mr. Yarrow is informed of the honor before he passes. This is a very urgent matter and I pray that the Kennedy Center will take this up in a timely manner. Sincerely, a life long fan. Mike Pechner I don’t remember what year it was exactly but it was in October somewhere in the 1980’s. I had always loved Peter , Paul and Mary ‘s music and I myself did some songwriting and singing while attending college in SUNY New Paltz. In 1970-72. And later in life as well. I still dabble in singing and songwriting for the fun of it. I was eager to hear Peter , Paul and Mary sing live and I arrived at their October concert .one year in the 1980’s. But when we walked into the theatre everything was decorated as if it was Christmas Day. The show was being pre taped and was to be aired on TV as a Christmas special . ,We all played along , pretended it was Christmas Day and sang our hearts out . The one song that stood out was always Puff the Magic Dragon, Blowin in the Wind and the song about the boy who wasn’t very good in baseball. Peter Yarrow.. thank you for making my life better with your music, stories and the hope that if we participate in what we believe in, we can make a change for ourselves and for the future of our children. When I see your picture or hear your voice I smile big! Thank you for you! Sincerely , Karen Landy It was fitting, for me, that your name was the first uttered when speaking of PPM. Fitting for me because of your soaring tenor voice, the one whose range was close to mine, the one I “identified” with. You 3 were my musical heroes back in the day, and heroes you remain. Your music, Peter, was a force, and its impetus pushed me to develop my voice and learn my guitar. The first person I sang and played for was my mother — Blowin’ In The Wind. Yeah, I know Dylan wrote it, but the song was yours. I so enjoyed your voice, I tried my best to learn the French of Mon Vrai Destin — my favorite of your solos. For me, the story of PPM remains fresh and new through the YouTube videos of your live performances. My friend, I know of your situation with cancer and I can relate — I’m Stage IV, prostate cancer. It’s not a fun club we’re in, but one finds so much love and caring through it. I am a person of prayer, and you will be in mine. Thank you for being a part of my life, even though you didn’t know it. I wish God’s peace for you as I send my love. Skip Wallace Charles Town, WV Many years ago I was Director of two group homes, and at that we frequently spent time with Peter and Mary Beth at Eagle Lake. Peter had come to the group home to play for girls, and they LOVED that he’d take the time to come and play and spend time with them. Peter also knew we struggled with a budget at the group home which was set by county commissioners, who were tight with funds. So, Peter said, “I’ll do a benefit concert for the group home!”. He helped with all the production details, which were many, but the concert came off smoothly to a full house at the COB (WEAC now), and the girls were SO proud to be at the concert for the group home. I had lunch with Peter the day after the concert, and he asked how we did with raising money. I told him we’d raised X amount of dollars, and he piled out his check book and matched that amount, asking I not share that he’d done that. So, I recently connected with one of the girls who lived at the home at that time, Sandy. She said the best thing she remembered from living at the group home was that Peter had gotten her on stage the night of that concert to join him in singing a song. It STILL impacted her, now that she was 50 years older. Peter had that kind of lasting impact on everyone with whom he came in contact. I’ve been so proud to count Peter as a friend. My best wishes to him, I will always hold his spirit close. Peace, my friend…. Mike Fischer My dear sweet Peter, ever since we met in the courtyard between Barb’s house and mine, in 2003, we’ve been friends. From you annually guesting me into Kerrville, to my performing with you several times on the Kerrville stage (once with Katie Marie), to our few times at the private River spot I took you to, I remember the past 21 years with such fondness. My heart is sad that one of the last times you texted me, you were really wanting to talk on the phone and catch up. “Schmooze” you called it. But life got busy and we texted but I put off calling too long. Then you went from calling yourself “Puff the LUCKY dragon” saying, “as it is with so many people who go through this, the positive aspects of new awareness and understanding that comes from surviving cancer is extraordinary indeed.” I’ll always cherish our times together and the photos we shared. You texted me the sun setting between the buildings on the well-known NYC street, I sent you old photos taken of us at our beloved music festival we share with so many as a second home. What will Kerrville be without you? You saved it so many times. What will our lives be without OUR Peter? I’m very grateful for you. I texted you telling you so, many times. I will miss you and your kindness. Thank you for your legacy and thank you most for being my dear sweet friend, Peter Yarrow! Love, Laran As a child I suffered with chronic ear infections. My mother would play Peter, Paul, and Mary albums for me and let me just try to lose myself in your beautiful harmonies. It helped. It also made me more aware of what was going on in the world as it was not just marvelous little toy I heard but leaving on a jet plane leading to discussions of Vietnam. I was four to six years old, Dad was in the Navy, and at sea much of that time. You helped instill a sense of the world will be okay as long as you and all of our folk singing family were making their voices heard. I sang your songs later in my teens to the children in the daycare where I worked hoping to pass on your wisdom, care, and joy. On behalf of my mother and myself we wish to thank you for your time, your words, and your music. You are loved. am 61 years old and I grew up listening to Peter, Paul and Mary. I was also fortunate enough to see them in concert many times over the years. Peter seemed like such a gentle and beautiful soul. Peter’s legacy will live on for generations. One of my favorite songs that Peter wrote is Light One Candle. It is so appropriate now: “ What is the memory that's valued so highly That we keep it alive in that flame? What's the commitment to those who have died That we cry out they've not died in vain? We have come this far always believing That justice would somehow prevail This is the burden, this is the promise This is why we will not fail!” ​ - Steve Vellines We grew up knowing Peter as a good friend of our parents. Through activism, politics and music he was connected with us and always so warm and kind when we were children and as we grew. He always brought positive energy, love and his guitar to our holiday parties (and really every time we saw him)! But it was very recently when our father Alan was dying of his own cancer that Peter showed the true heart and soul that made him a dear friend for so many people. He offered to sing to our father while he was in hospice care and came to his hospital bed and put on a private concert. Our father had not opened his eyes in days but did that day, even briefly, for the first time, acknowledging his friend Peter was there and that his beautiful music was reaching his ears. My father looked up to Peter in many ways as a role model, a partner in many projects through the years and a close friend. But it was this act that showed us who Peter is to his core. Someone who would do anything for his friends to bring them happiness, comfort and joy. Who always thinks of inspiring others through service and through his gift of music to the world. Peters songs that day may have been the last words our father heard as he passed away very shortly after. If they were, we are happy and comforted knowing they were sung by his friend Peter Yarrow. ​ - Michael & Brian Handell I have loved the group and each member since I was a teen in the early 70's. I wore out the album \"10 years together\" back then and have seen them dozens of times in concert. For decades I rarely missed a show at Wolf Trap, including the summer after Mary passed away. Seeing and listening to their music gave me such joy - their voices, messages and their presence. Every year on the first day of Chanukah I post the video of Light One Candle on Facebook. It's sad that their messages of peace and equality still have to be so boldly proclaimed but wonderful that they exist to keep passing on to future generations. I have loved every moment of my fandom and hope that this reaches Peter to know how much he has meant to me and countless others. Love, Beverly Dear Mr. Yarrow I hope this day finds you feeling a little better. PUFF THE MAGIC DRAGON is the greatest song ever recorded. Only one other touches my heart in the same way and that is the simple song, JESUS LOVES ME, THIS I KNOW.....I am a 73 year old poet and musician and find those rhyming words paired with the perfect melody resonate with me to the very depths of my being!! I never did any sort of illegal drugs or anything like that so I don't find any hidden meanings in the words of PUFF. It says to me that ... \"Life goes on and we must go along with it and leave the things of childhood behind.\" I had to grow old, but I didn't have to grow up because I can return to a LAND CALLED HONALEE every time I hear PUFF THE MAGIC DRAGON. I am truly sorry that your health is failing you today. But Peter, Paul and Mary will live on in the hearts of every person who ever sang along with those magical verses of PUFF THE MAGIC DRAGON . May God Bless and Keep You. Sonny Ashley Wichita Falls, Texas I bought my first ever LP when I was twelve in ’62; PPM at The Bitter End. In all my Boomer music years – certainly including the Beatles – no group garnered my love and respect as much as PPM. And forever. Much later, when my son was about seven, I took him to a PPM concert on the UT campus in Austin. Afterwards, we went to a favorite haunt, the original Kerbey Lane Café for dinner. Sitting and eating at our table, Rick (my son) said, pointing,” Isn’t that Peter over there?” We looked, and it was. Peter and a lady friend at a small table about 20 feet away. Rick excitedly asked, “Can I go talk to him?” Not wanting to intrude, we told him no just about the moment he jumped up and hurried over to their table. We could see Peter greet him with the warmest smile and talk to him patiently a few moments. Then he took Rick by the hand and led him back to our table and stood by and talked most pleasantly and graciously with my wife and me a few minutes. We – and Rick – have never forgot the genuine humanness and grace of him, and Paul, and Mary exemplified in those few moments. Then, later, Peter worked with my brother, Steve Dodds, on aspects of the Kerrville Music Festival, and he befriended Steve. Through some conversation, Peter autographed and addressed to me personally a copy of the iconic photo of the group performing at the Lincoln Memorial in ’63. It is a treasured object I view every day hanging in my den. A symbol of the times - and of the real, heartfelt justice that Peter, and Paul, and Mary stood for, and sang for, and lived their lives for. There never was and never ever will be another group so worthy of honor and remembrance. Paul was wrong about the Beatles – your magic was always greater than theirs. ​ - Lyndon Dodds Hi again Peter, As promised, here's my story along with some photos which I'll always treasure. The night you came to Lonesome Traveler in New York for the second time was a night to remember always. Thank you again so much for coming up onstage to do encores with the cast and for your generous gifts of the PPM book, inscribed personally to each of us. Your meeting with us that night along with the stories you told were magical. For a time I regretted that I didn't think to turn on the recorder on my phone. I've thought since then that it was meant to be just for us, a very, very special treat. You may recall that you asked me to look after your guitar during the show. I saw your set list from another concert taped to the top and immediately thought what an exceptional gift it was to me to be asked to care for this very special instrument for a even a short time. The photos attached are the ones I took that night while you were watching the show. Karyl Lynn sends her love to you. Her special memory is the night in the rehearsal studio on Martin Luther King Day when you sat in a circle with the cast and told the story of Selma. It was one of many life-changing, inspirational times in your presence. You are and always will be loved, loved, loved... Jim Peter, So sad to hear that you are ill. You and your 2-3 sidekicks have brought generations of smiles, wisdom, activism to our family, as well as many others, I'm sure. We've seen you numerous times going back to the 60s in venues across Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York, always leaving with big smiles but more importantly inspired to do good for so many causes. Our only child, Kristen, has shared these passions herself and with our two grandsons (it's generational, man!). For a number of years, I have been a volunteer member of the Advisory Board of our local Salvation Army doing, as we say, The Most Good. You taught us to reach out and support the needy, and we'll never forget those lessons. May God bless you. Your friend, John Hayek Endwell, NY It was sometime in the 1970s. Peter had gone out on his own and the group, for all intended purposes, had quit performing. I was a young man in my early twenties and at the end of my college years. Peter was booked to perform in the University of Utah Union building ballroom as a solo act. Of course, he sang a number of the PP&M songs and, in particular, Puff and The Great Mandela. He put on a great show, which we all enjoyed, but the most significant part of the show was his navigation to hang around after the show so we could all get to know one another better. Since this was 50 years ago, I don’t remember everything said that night, but more importantly, I remember his ingratiating manner and true interest in what people had to say. We all sat on the floor in a big circle and talked. Peter took the opportunity to discuss his personal philosophies and also to talk about the war that we had suffered for a number of years. I found him intelligent, sincere and both fun and funny and I was so glad I stayed that night. I saw the group at the height of their success in the early sixties sitting on the front row under Mary and at least three other times to a final concert in Las Vegas, which may have been her last. These three amazing entertainers made a difference. Puff will be around for ages to the delight of children every where and The Wedding Song is probably still the one of the most played songs at weddings everywhere. Who could forget beautiful Mary swinging her long blond hair from side to side while belting out If I Had a Hammer? Thank you Peter for your immense contribution. You have much to be proud of. You inspired a generation and will never be forgotten. As a cancer patient myself, and someone who has held it at bay for eleven years, I understand your fight and wish you well on the last leg of your journey. I send you, Bethany and Christopher peace and love. Robert. Don't let the light go out! I have listened to the Trio for more than 60 years. Puff was no more than a baby lizard when I first fell in love with Mary (and then the Boys) and finally had a chance to see and hear in person some years ago. Since then, we travelled up and down Cailfornia any chance we could. Paid $100 per ticket once, then again and again, when $100 was a lot of money for a young couple. A dear friend was President of the Cerritos Performing Arts Center when P,P&M were performing back-to-back nights a few years ago and she arranged for my late wife and I to attend the after show backstage event. We met. We talked. We got autographs and photos. Having stayed at the hotel near the center for the second performance, we bumped into to Noel and Mary the next morning. A treat for real fans who sang many a song around the campfires when our children were growing up. You made our lives richer and the world a better place, Peter! We love you, all three of you, and will be singing about flowers blowing in the wind for the rest of time! Bob Williams Costa Mesa, CA I have always known Peter Yarrow, and he has always known me. I was 5 years old and very sick with Rubella and my mom set the record player next to my bed. He sang me to sleep. Then, a few years later, I began singing with him. He taught me how to harmonize. When I was an angry, too young to be a hippie teen, he introduced me to the inside of the music. I discovered the artistry of layering the power of music with the passion of lyrics. I learned to be a gentle warrior, a musical prize fighter, a singer of conscience. While my peers steeped themselves in electric sounds, I dwelled deeply in the art of acoustic poetry. Peter gave me that and I came to know is that I am folk music. In my 70 years I have been inspired to be ferociously peaceful, and I have learned to speak fluently the language of the quest for a noble humanity that is the essence of Peter's songs. Folk music has been my native langue, my way of life, even when nobody was singing, that to the mind, the heart and soul that Peter shared with me. And so, I know Peter Yarrow well, not because we ever met, but because I was his audience, one of the people he tried to reach. He did so with every song he wrote. Those songs told me who he was and who I wanted to be. I have listened to them all over and again, as I always will. I no longer need an electronic medium to hear them. They are me, and I have taught them to everyone I have ever known. Peter has sung with me my entire life and spoken to me in the language of living with purpose. I believe he did that for millions of people. What could be more important than that? Thank you, Peter for being one of my dearest teachers. ​ - Katherine Scotta Dear Peter, We've worked together several times, but I'm especially reminded of two memorable performances: a concert you did for us PP (pre-pandemic) here in Schenectady, that was especially memorable and fu, starting when I picked you up at Albany International Airport. You burst out of the terminal having lost your cellphone, but remarkably weren't worried at all about this. You just called for help and we proceeded to the hotel, talking all the way. You brought so much vibrant energy! Later we went on air at WMHT-fm Public Radio during their fund drive, where you gave away your newly published book on Peter, Paul & Mary to donors. The concert was warm and rich, and as always the music - and you - were magical. Your audiences always came to you like personal friends, as indeed they were - just didn't happen to know you. The other was in the City (NYC) for SeegerFest, on which I was working with the Seeger family. It was a series of memorial concerts honoring Pete. You were part of a concert - at Lincoln Center Out of Doors, which also featured Harry Belafonte, Holly Near, Paul Winter Consort, a call taken onstage from Leonard Peltier by Tinya (Pete & Toshi's daughter), Judy Collins, Clearwater Sloop Singers, Tom Chapin and a line for tickets that stretched around the block. A capacity house on a beautiful Summer afternoon - an outpouring of love and soaring music, a one-of-a-kind event. You opened your apartment and provided food for Clearwater people, and I stopped up there with Robert Corwin, whom I'd recruited to photograph the concert. You are the soul of generosity and kindness, Peter. I often think these days of how very lucky we all are to have landed somehow in this particular time, space, generation, community, to be surrounded by all this music with a conscience...the odds seem very much against it. You have been a guiding light, Peter, besides a delight to know a bit and work with. May your time continue to be blessed with family and friends, and thank you for your voice, for your vision, endurance, professional standards and - well, for dedicating your life's work to the real stuff. For being real. Bet you know what I mean. With much love and admiration, Margie Rosenkranz, The Eighth Step, Schenectady, NY To Peter and family, My fond memories go back along way- to the early 60’s. Actually earlier… I was in 1954 with folk music playing in our home (Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, etc). Then in the early 60’s my parents took me to a PPM concert. That was it! I was forever hooked on their beautiful harmonies! But more importantly, their courage, compassion and activism in the name of humanity. Then in the late 80’s - after I had been songwriting, singing and performing for a while my group was asked to sing at a folk concert in Central Park. PPM was the headlining act! After our set, you, Peter, came up to me, put your arm on my shoulder and told me I had a beautiful (tenor) voice, that you enjoyed my songs and to “keep singing and never give up!” Your words of kindness will stay with me forever! Everytime I watched your concerts on PBS and your impassioned please for people to contribute to PBS I had chills running up my arms and down my spine. I’ve been doing a folk radio show (The Hootenanny Cafe Radio Show (now on Wtbq for almost 30 years. We’ve talked in the past about you coming on but sadly that never happened. To this day, and beyond, you, Peter Yarrow, will remain as a true hero and icon in the name of humanity and folk music! Long live Peter, Paul and Mary!!!!! Jon Stein Hootenanny Cafe Radio Show Wtbq Our most direct and personal connection with Peter dates to 1977 when Peter took an interest in helping my wife and I with our non-profit organization, The Fret Set, in which we organized free concerts in the L.A. area to nurture fretted instrument performers of every musical genre. We spent many a post-midnight hour seeking Peter’s sage advice on the telephone and exchanging information via his Malibu mailbox, culminating in him volunteering to host our finale concert featuring the Los Angeles Mandolin Orchestra plus four other acts ranging from folk and classical guitarists to a plugged-in blues band (see attached flyer). Peter contributed throughout, from the care and feeding of our needy sound system (which many will recognize as a Peter Yarrow specialty!) to performing a solo song prior to his introduction of each act … then lingering afterward to chat with our volunteers and pose for group photos. To this I must add to the chorus of Peter’s influence as part of Peter Paul and Mary, whose concerts I never missed. Their music hit the airwaves and college hangout juke boxes just as I graduated from high school in 1962, compelling me to take up a lifelong love affair with 6- and 12-string guitar, with nearly half my repertoire comprised of PPM tunes. But wait, there’s so much more! Just prior to reporting for Air Force active duty in 1969 I played hooky from grad school to take an off-campus folk guitar class in which I met the fingerpicking sweetie that became my wife of 53 years as of this December 18. What brought her to the class? Well, her love of PPM of course! We went on to develop duet arrangements based on those illustrated in the invaluable book “Peter Paul and Mary Guitar”—arrangements which we have instilled in our children and now look forward to passing on to our late-arrival grandchildren, beginning with an upcoming “Puff” performance at their pre-school. Finally, it happens that my goal for this year is to complete my book focused on the Sixties folk music scene in which I pay a more detailed tribute to PPM’s role in inspiring so many other fabulous folk musicians that have enriched our lives. Many an apple seed has taken root beneath the PPM tree—thank you for the profound way in which you have touched so many lives, Peter! ​ - Michael Lamb Dearest Peter, Bethany, Christopher, Mary Beth, and others of the clan, I'm Anya's sister, and although my family and I have generally come as a package deal along with her, I wanted to send a message of my own to you. As I know so many others have said and will continue to say...thank you. Thank you for the kindness, dignity, and passion you have embodied in your storied lives, not just as musicians and performers, but as activists, wisdom-keepers, and friends, and which you have personally shown me and my family. Peter (or, as we all call you, Petey), I first met you at a little outdoor venue in Portsmouth, NH, back in 2012. In our photo at the meet-and-greet afterwards, you grabbed my head in your arm and, funnily, I remember how soft your forearm was! It seems so silly but I still treasure that moment. Who knew, all these years later, we'd go out to dinner together, share life advice, and be sleeping over at your kids' houses?! Speaking of, I can't begin to tell you how meaningful it was to attend the dinner and benefit house concert at Bethany's back in 2019. Anya and I had planned to drive back to New Hampshire when it was over, but a huge rainstorm came in and we ended up spending the night with everyone instead. After the air and energy of the performance melted away, Christopher built a fire and we spent time on the floor just chatting and catching up. At some point, you, Anya and I sat on a little couch up against the wall (your still-just-as-soft arms wrapped around us both!) and spent a long time talking about life, art, working with integrity, being in alignment with yourself, and connecting with folks who can guide you as you walk through the world. Although I don't remember your specific advice, I know it was meaningful in the moment and helped me to find courage and confidence in the essence of who I am. As one of those younger fans who was introduced to PPM and your solo music by my parents, the soundtrack of my life has often included your work. In an era of inequality and strife, uncertain yet all-too-familiar, your unique mark on history informs so much of my own musical sensitivity and community approach. I'm an artist and musician in my own right, and beginning, for the first time, at 34 years old, to really imbue myself and my beliefs into what I create, rather than just singing hackneyed arias and painting landscapes for a paycheck. Sharing art that speaks up and speaks out, especially when you can do it with others, is the strongest way I know of to effect change. I am in constant awe of the way your words have moved generations of people to do better, to look deeper, and to join in community for a just and better tomorrow. There is obviously still much to learn, for me and for us all, but I am so grateful to know your gentle spirit, sharp wit, and deep wisdom. I hope you are finding comfort in the outpouring of love that this project has brought forth! It has been one of the greatest joys of my life getting to know you all. Never in a million years did I think that our families would become friends, but I'm so thankful we have and will continue to be. May you all take time to nurture yourselves and enjoy each other's company. Wishing you all the very best, in gratitude and love, Ruth I was raised listening to The Weavers, Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, and of course Peter, Paul and Mary. In my 53 years I have been fortunate to see PP&M live in concert many times; but nothing was more special than introducing my son, Jacob, to Puff the Magic Dragon and Peter Yarrow. In 2007 we (3 generations - my son, myself & my parents) attended an event at our local indie bookstore in Acton, MA for the release of \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" by Peter Yarrow, Lenny Lipton with paintings by Eric Puybaret. Peter Yarrow sang and engaged the young audience with his energy and enthusiasm. He pulled my then 6 year old son out of the audience and sang a chorus of \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" with him. The kid in the green shirt holding the plush Puff is Jacob. My mother could not have been more thrilled and from that moment forward insisted that Peter Yarrow had \"chosen\" her grandson; that Peter saw how clever Jacob was. It is a such a beautiful and special memory shared by all of us, but especially between grandson and grandparents. A few years after that book store event, he gifted his grandparents his own drawing of \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" as inspired by that book. A testament to the love of magic dragons that will always live on. My family is just one of the many lives Peter Yarrow has touched with his gifts. We are sending wishes of peace and healing to Peter and his family! Dear Peter, I hope these words find you in a peaceful and comfortable moment. I was born in the early sixties and can't remember the first time I heard your music. It was always there in elementary school. I knew the lyrics long before I understood them but somehow elementary school was the perfect place to have your music. In high school most of us were too cool or insecure to sing about Puff. After a first career in the Navy I returned home and followed some friends' suggestion to pick up the guitar and become a teacher. After over 30 years of teaching mostly kindergarten I have just retired. I taught and sang many of your songs and was given praise for how I touched so many hearts. Now I'm even getting paid in retirement to return every week to lead the sing along. But truly it was your songs through me that did it. Especially Puff! I was just channeling the authentic love I felt as I listened and watched your PBS specials. I was fortunate enough to have met you at the Garamendi Ranch in 2016. Your music continues to find new generations of appreciative listeners. I thank you for your continuing contributions to the hungry hearts of the world. With great appreciation, Michael Bonomo Dear dear Yarrow family, I am a long time fan of Peter, Paul and Mary. My personal experiences with you started at a National Middle School Convention in Baltimore, Md. We teachers were thrilled and emotional that presentation. It was your 'Don't Laugh at Me' Intro. I then had the opportunity to attend and to come backstage with my friend-Jane Rosen who was a dear friend of Mary Travers at your concert at Lake Michigan College in Benton Harbor. We three rode over the next day to your Concert at Jackson Community College and because of Mary's appreciation, we were invited to partake in the wonderful salad you created Peter, though you weren't too happy with the ripeness of the avocado. The fellowship was warm and appreciated. I live in Berrien Springs and the nearby Acorn Theater in Three Oaks hosted you and Bethany several times-I was in attendance each time. Such warm and wonderful memories because each time you greeted me like a long lost friend. All my love to you dear talented and loving human being and Love and understanding in the next days' journey. Rest and know you are loved and you leave love Sincerely a retired teacher who loved her life in Education-Sauzette Pelton I first met Peter within days of my first Kerrville in 1987 and he quickly invited me to play with him. I was so excited as I'd grown up hearing him. I've included a picture from 1988, and enjoyed playing with him so many times. He often celebrated his birthday on the canoe trips I helped run from the festival and I wish I could find the picture of the year he took the rosemary from the smoked salmon (luxury canoe trip, NOT whitewater!) and tucked it behind his years, dancing about like Julius Cesar! And the picture hugging my mother not long before she passed. I was honored to play with him for Kerrville director Rod Kennedy in his last hours, after Rod had waited while Peter called from Israel, NYC and San Antonio to get there in time. Really, Peter is laced through so many important moments in my life. I feel so blessed, and I send such love and prayers now. ​ - Beth Galiger Dear Peter, I cannot thank you enough for the grace, love and beauty you brought into my life. As a child of the 60s, I always knew and loved the music of Peter, Paul & Mary -- that is a given for all in my generation. I even remember taking a vinyl record to Germany with me to be able to play your songs while studying for six months abroad while in college. But the impact of who YOU are in particular came later on two occasions that I can pinpoint to each day, because they were that important to me. On both of these occasions, I joined in with you as you brought your message of peace and love and caring for others to us in small, intimate settings. The first was at the University of San Diego, where I spent my career, and accepted your invitation to join you and others on stage in the Institute for Peace & Justice to sing along during an education conference being held on 6/26/2002. The sense of community you created was so genuine, and it was certainly a feeling we are all missing now in our world. The second time was on 10/19/2007 at the Barnes & Noble store in Encinitas, California where you led songs. My husband and I went and stood in the back of the Children’s section to join in with Puff the Magic Dragon. I have missed your visits to Rancho La Puerta with friends who work there, but I know that everyone truly reveres you there also. Thank you for blessing my life with your music, your activism and all you have stood for. May you find peace. With love and thanks always, Linda Scales Solana Beach, CA Dear Peter, It’s not important that you remember me, but you reached out to help Tim de Christopher, who was a climate activist on trial for buying land in Utah to save it from fossil fuel extraction. You came to Salt Lake City for a fundraise, came to dinner at our home and I drove you to the airport for a very early flight. During this time I learned that you were so much more than the remarkable musician/singer I had known. You were involved in so many causes, all revealing the active humanitarian that you were/are. And so I want to thank you for your exemplary life, which has touched so many. And I want to share a quote, which , as an artist, I have put in my art and that beautifully defines your life and character : “This is the true joy in life: Being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one, being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it what I can. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations.” George Bernard Shaw ​ - Elise Lazar I first joined the NY Choral Society in Septamber 1990, and in February 1991, sang with Peter at one of the P.S. 6 concerts. I did not really know what to expect, but everyone told me it would be FUN! The day of the concert, he looked around the group of us \"back-up\" singers, greeting each person like an old friend. When he got to me, he stood back (I was the \"newbie\"), then pulled me in to a great hug, singing \"everything is gonna be alright\". Over the next few years, there were many concerts with the NY Choral Society and Peter, Paul and Mary, each one exciting, each one special. Fast forward to 2012 - I was with my two children (my husband and I met in the NYCS) in Barnes and Noble, waiting in line to have the new Puff The Magic Dragon book signed by Peter. When it was our turn, Peter looked at my kids, and I said to him - \"I sing with the NY Choral Society, as does my husband - and these two are choral society babies!\" He grabbed us all in a big hug, again like we were old friends. That day, the line was out the door - Peter came to the door and called out - \"everyone will get in - don't worry!\" He brought joy and, more joy, to us all. - Maria Schwab Dear Peter, Thank you for all your inspirational, uplifting songs. Thank you for your generous LOVE and caring that you easily share with so many people. I hold so many memories of special moments like tagging along to dinners after the concerts, meeting Mary Beth and your son, Christopher, singing along on stage and at the camp fire after rafting down the river, and all your kind words. Puff the Magic Dragon reminds me to dream. Don't Laugh at Me inspires me to do more volunteer work and give dignity to those in need. Stewball reminds me to be persistent. Leaving on a Jet Plane is like a love letter to my family. Early Morning Rain is just so beautiful. Where have All the Flowers Gone should be sung more often. If I Had a Hammer leads me to do more activism. I always loved the PP&M folk music the BEST of all that was ever out there. Your group has affected our history and our determination. I will always sing those songs. Please know that you have LOVE flowing to you from SO MANY people. I am sending you hugs and soft kisses on your forehead. I extend my hand of support to help ease you on this final path. Love to You from Valerie. Peter, I was unbelievably lucky to get to know you when I was in elementary school at PS6, because I was in the same class as your daughter, Bethany. Peter, you gave so generously of your time, talent, and energy, that you came to our school, to our class, every week to sing with us and you were very much a part of the fabric of our lives. I grew up singing (and owning) all the PPM songs and albums and I will love them forever. Just last week I was visiting my Aunt and \"Leavin' on a Jet Plane\" came on her car radio and I had that jolt of, this is MY MUSIC, and I harmonized with every Peter descant, from \"Go--oh-oh--oh -oh\" to \"They don't mean a thing\" to \"I'll wear...your ring\"...well, you get it. All of those glorious Peter vocals, I was singing every one. So - for anyone listening (and Peter, I hope you are) - here is my story of how Peter changed my life - and I was lucky enough to be able to tell him this years ago, but I would love it if he heard it again now. Because he literally changed my life, and I will love him forever. When Bethany and I were in fifth grade at P.S. 6 in Manhattan, our class took a week-long trip to some place in Connecticut where we stayed in...log cabins? tents? I don't remember. But we had a week at this place where we were sent to experience nature, beyond the boundaries of Central Park. I don't know why, but somehow it was decided that we would have a talent show towards the end of this experience. I signed up to sing with a friend, who then decided she didn't want to do it. As a Very Shy Girl, with Very Few Friends, i don't know why I decided to do the show anyway. But I did. I remember standing up in front of a class full of kids that didn't particularly like me, and who had been boisterous (aka obnoxious) through much of the previous content of the evening. And then I started to sing \"The Rainbow Connection.\" And at some point, as I was singing...I realized the room had gone silent. And when I finished the song, there was loud applause. From kids who really, REALLY didn't like me. It was a revelation for me, that the way I could communicate with people was through song, through performing... And here's the kicker - Peter Yarrow was there that night. He watched the whole show. He heard me sing......He HEARD me. A shy kid, who really needed some validation. And he pulled me aside after the show, and told me that he thought I had a lovely voice, and that if I wanted to pursue a career in singing, I might want to look into starting voice lessons...and...and... His support, his encouragement, his faith in me led me to do exactly what he suggested. I found great voice teachers. I majored in theatre in college. I toured with musical theatre shows for many years, and am still singing and acting to this day. I guess above all what I want to say is THANK YOU PETER (or, as we used to call you, in elementary school - \"Pillow\") - for spending your time with me, for introducing me to your music and for making that music a part of my soul...AND...for giving a shy, unpopular child love, advice, confidence...and for helping her (me) understand that being a unicorn is not so bad after all. I will remember, honor, and love you forever. ​ - Terry Kaye 1963. Christmas. I was in the 9th grade. I’d played the violin for years, but—having heard “Louie, Louie”— I realized we were not going to be lifelong companions. Enter my Uncle, a man I barely knew. A man from Out-of-Town. He came bearing gifts. His to me was “In the Wind”, by some trio I didn’t know. They played music I also didn’t know. Enter my Mother. I had been lusting over a guitar I saw in a store—a blue Harmony archtop. What I GOT was a beat up (!)old Gibson flattop. With a horse head and a cactus decal on the front. Yoicks! Enter the Music. You three wonderful people taught me SO MUCH about phrasing and breath work and out-of-the box harmonies!! I cherished each new album and bought the books and slowly, ever so slowly my beat up box and I grew. I learned to play the guitar listening to you, even though I never could play in those awful keys you chose. I had the Devil’s own time learning the chords to “The Great Mandala! Later, after I took up the string bass, I stole everything I could from Dick Kniss. In turn, I taught my little sister. (Sorry, we always ended up singing Mary’s parts.) I dragged that old Gibson to family holidays and shared your tunes with all my cousins. All of them have passed your songs to their children. And on and on, so it still goes. At 75 I still play, though no longer on gigs. My 4-octave voice has settled into a deep bass, so I have been learning your and Noel’s parts. (Finally.) This has turned into a book, so I will again sayTHANK YOU for informing my life with so much beauty. I love you. ​ - Geoff Albertson I have always loved harmony. Harmony in nature, harmony in relationships, harmony in the workplace, and just harmony in the world. Unfortunately, I never had a harmonious voice and so regretted it, as I loved to sing. When I sang, my friends made fun of me. It was enough to melt me into a corner. Then I heard Peter, Paul and Mary. I was enthralled by their harmonies. I thought, “I can find some harmonies somewhere within their ranges. Maybe I can sing! I listened to their music over and over, and over again, and finally found my voice (albeit, not a good one, but a happy one). I finally learned what singing was about. Pure joy, just pure joy. Thank you, sir. Your music will live on. I sing it with my granddaughters. You are a blessing to this world. ​ - Judy Evans-Canner At the Elizabeth Barrett Browning middle school, conditions were dire. The hallways were chaotic and often dangerous. I was a new teacher and was elated, but concerned when I heard that the assembly was going to be with Peter Yarrow. My students what very short attention spans, and were quite loud. How could Peter, all alone in the school’s huge auditorium be heard? I feared a riot. Peter spoke straight to the kids with respect. When he began singing the soft, familiar songs from my childhood, I was amazed to see the students relax, soften and one girl started sucking her thumb. Several fell asleep. They loved Peter and showed that they were still children. It was a wonderful concert. ​ - Gretchen Loase I became a dyed in the wool fan of Peter Paul and Mary the instant I heard their Blowing In The Wind on the radio in the early 60s. That has never faded and to this day, when I am traveling, in my head I sing their songs in my head. My favorite is and has always been Puff The Magic Dragon. A few years ago I went to see Peter perform in Raleigh, North Carolina. When he invited folks to come on stage to join him in singing Puff, I was up there in a flash. I was lucky enough to have a seat beside the stage. During intermission, Peter and I crossed paths and I stopped and said, \"Peter Yarrow, you represent and express everything that I believe in.\" At that point he stepped up to me and gave me a huge hug. We spoke during the rest of intermission and again after the show. This experience was and still is one of the most thrilling and delightful experiences of my life. Peter, your voice and beliefs have been a guiding star in my life and will be as long as I breathe. God bless you for the good person you are! ​ - William Carrington It was 1972. I was 22 and in the first year of a job I hated - but the pay was great. I would have rather been playing my guitar in Harvard Square. While attending a professional conference in Pittsburgh, I looked out the hotel window and wondered why a small crowd had gathered at Point State Park, where the rivers converged. Curious, I very unprofessionally left the conference to investigate. It was a free concert with Peter Yarrow on stage. When I returned home after the conference, I handed in my resignation, returned to Cambridge and started teaching elementary school, where I could play my guitar and banjo for my students every day. ​ - Tom Smith Dear Peter, You welcomed me as a new friend into a life already filled with so many longtime dear friends. When I became the Senior Rabbi at Leo Baeck Temple, Ken Fritz's synagogue, 22 years ago, you were delighted to find out that the new rabbi was a folk singer/songwriter who had been influenced by you from the time of his childhood. You asked to hear my music, and we even sang together at a program for the temple community during the pandemic. It was a thrill to sing and play with one of my musical heroes... but it was an even greater thrill to get to know you... your kindness, your joyful imagination, your deep care about humanity. You didn't need new friends... but you made one. For life. I will be among the many proud carriers of your legacy, and I will sing your songs with joy and spirit and hope for tomorrow. With love and wishes for your peace, Ken The video is of PETER'S OWN WORDS, DECEMBER 2024 — Since I've only learned in the past 15 years or so that Peter was aware of my work, I don't have the personal history with him as so many of my fellow artists do. I had no idea that he had been to \"The Hill\" in Central Park over the years where I've been sharing music and stories and thoughts and feelings for the past 3 decades as \"That Guitar Man from Central Park\". But like so many, from the moment I met this powerful yet gentle man in person I've felt like I've known him for a Lifetime. As I now make the transition from a career as a songwriter to the Life of a playwright, he is one of those rare people in music who can leave a tremendous impression on my spirit... just because of his gentle strength. Just knowing Peter is an honor. But getting to work with him or Create with him is beyond beautiful. Yes... Peter is all about Love, and Music, and Peace, and Goodness, and Decency, and Humor, and Kindness. But for me, with all of those beautiful words flying around him, if I had to choose one word to land on the man it would be... \"Sincere\". Even through his monumental physical challenge of the last year and the heartbreak of the last election, he agreed to introduce our \"Year End\" concert in New York City's Merkin Hall. Even though he couldn't show up in person, I know that his words, the feelings he shared with the audience that night will stay with them... just as his music his lives in so many hearts across the country and around the world. As Peter would say... \"Go well, my Brother. PEACE always.\" — David Ippolito Hi Peter, Every Thursday afternoon, I bring my guitar to our local nursing home and sing for and with some of the folks there. They especially love to hear Puff. One day, an extra verse came to me: “The years went by in dreaming While Puff slept in his den Then one day the Cherry Lane began to bloom again Jackie’s little daughter had found their magic friend For dragons live forever And Puff’s story has no end.” Thanks for all the music! Love, Sue Dear Peter, Decades ago, you and Paul and Mary sang at the Britt Festival in Jacksonville, Oregon. I volunteered that night, so I got to sit on a blanket right off the stage. During intermission, I gathered my courage and spoke to you in accolades. You made this young-at-heart old maid feel Loved, when you Kissed me on my left cheek. I am a storyteller and have told that story countless times over the years. THANK YOU! EEhugs and Teddy Bear Love, Kath. P.S. I have all the trio’s songs on my IPad and play them constantly. I was inspired to learn the guitar the first time I heard PP&M in concert when I was in high school. I was inspired to use my talents to help promote causes because of your passion, Peter. For many, many years I have performed music that I am passionate about and has a good message. At 74 I am still performing mini concerts in senior citizen facilities where one of the most popular songs is “Puff”. Peter, you and Noel and Mary helped me find a purpose and begin a positive journey. We have met many times—you would recognize my face but not my name probably. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Love to you and your family. ​ - Jim Kirkendall Dear Peter, Twenty-eight years ago today, Herman Philips, a dear friend of my father and member of the NY Choral Society, brought me to a PPM rehearsal for your 1996 holiday concert. I met you, Noel, and Mary that evening, and had the heart-gift of being able to thank you, hug you. \"Sweetheart,\" I remember you saying to me. At the end of the rehearsal, I gathered the nerve to approach you and ask whether I could take a photo with you. I never had such a joyous smile as in that treasured picture. For you had already begun to etch justice and hope, peace and purpose and love, into my heart. I had grown up watching your early PBS concerts. And since I got my first PPM cassette and CD three years before that winter night in Riverside Church, and ever since, you have been a nearly daily presence in my life. I would love to talk to you now and tell you all about the role so many of your songs have had in my life -- Take the Chance, Sweet Survivor, Light One Candle, the Great Mandala, Don't Laugh at Me, and on, and on, and on. But I know you have countless more tributes to hear. So I will let you go now, soon to melt into the stars and the sea, and join the flow of that River Jordan. You will never leave my heart. Love & Peace, Forever and Forever, Eric A. Friedman Oh no! I had no idea that Peter was so ill. I saw that Peter and Paul were scheduled to be at the Kate Theater ths summer and I already made plans to be there. I saw PP&M twice during my college years. I learned how to play the guitar during that time and their music was my very favorite...fast forward...A few years ago I discovered a folk singing society here in Rochester, NY. My guitar was sold a long time ago, but after joining Golden Link my love for folk music was renewed. I am now learning the banjo so I can join the Tuesday jam group.And what songs am I singing? PP&M of course! Thank you for being so much a part of my past life and going forward. Bless you, Peter. Know how you are an icon for so many people. Hugs Jane Dear Sir, Thank you for all you have done to inspire us each of us. I was fortunate enough to have seen PP&M back in the early 90's and in that moment I decided to pursue music for a living. Although I have not found success, I continue to write songs in the hopes that my music will touch another's life as yours has done mine. You blazed a trail, you sang about what you believed in, and the truth you shared as a songwriter and performer will live on in so many of us. You are loved, you are appreciated......Thank you!!!!!!! OXOX Lara Redding, CT I only met Peter Yarrow once and it left a lasting impression. Pete Fornatale was my partner on a program called Mixed Bag Radio. Pete was a dear friend who opened so many doors and introduced me to so many wonderful people. One of our 200 sessions was with Peter, Paul and Mary. What a day! When Peter and I went to shake hands, he gave me a big hug, A BIG HUG. That moment and Peter’s kind words have stayed with me for all these years. I realize that hundreds, if not thousands, if not tens of thousands have been impacted in this memorable way, by this kind, talented and generous man. I’ve always wanted to thank him and now I have the chance. Thank you Peter for a lasting memory of kindness and love! When your time on earth is done, there will be two Peters waiting for you at the pearly gates! Yarrow will be greeted by Saint Peter and Peter Fornatale … give them both a BIG HUG! ​ - Chris Hall I was born in 1957, and some of my oldest memories are listening to you, sir, singing with Paul and Mary. Before your dragon became a beloved staple in my musical world, my sister and I hid a transistor radio under the pillows in our shared bed and fell asleep listening to If I Had a Hammer, Lemon Tree, and Where Have All the Flowers Gone. Later, when Puff came along, it made me cry but I loved it nonetheless. It still does, some 60 or so years later. I learned to hear, and sing, harmony from you, a gift that I have continued to use for life. I saw you perform, in Dallas, and more memorably, at the Kerrville Folk Festival around 1984/85. My husband turned out be a huge Peter, Paul, and Mary fan too. It was our first trip together and, being there was like sitting in a living room with you - intimate and personal. The sing-a-long was truly glorious. It is a most treasured memory. Currently, I sing with a group, called Credo, a community choir in Dallas. When our director handed us Light One Candle, I almost cried. It has been a favorite for many, many years and I am so honored to finally have the opportunity to sing it onstage. It’s been decades and I am both saddened, and astonished, that so many of the songs that influenced my life and beliefs are still just as relevant, now, as they were so very long ago, coming out of a tiny transistor radio. I hoped we would be a much different world, by now. But the songs and their message will live on, until we no longer need them. You have been the light, the candle in the darkness, for many years and I hope you will allow us to carry, in some small way, your light forward as we strive to pass it on to future generations. May peace be with you, sir. ​ - Patti Erickson I have photographed Peter, Paul and Mary since my early days as a photographer. First, when I was still in the High School of Performing Arts in New York City, where I majored in classical guitar. I was so inspired by the folk musicians to play those beautiful nylon string guitars! So, in 1969, I photographed P,P, & M at Carnegie Hall. When I finally published my first nook, Eye of the Music, I made sure to include one of those photos ... as well as others I shot over the decades of them ... Times Square Ant-War rallies, Peter at San Francisco rallies, The Music Center in LA, The Hollywood Bowl, UCLA (Troubadours of Folk). Their music has been part of the musical fabric of my life. I just found this photo of Peter at The Music Center in 1980, with a reflection in the mirror of me, photographing him! Hope he gets to see this. Thank you Peter, for a lifetime of making the world a better place! ​ - Sherry Rayn Barnett Peter, It has been truly a privilege and pleasure - yes, a joy - to have known you, and most of all to have played autoharp with you so many years at the Kerrville Folk Festival. I think of you often, and of Chris and Bethany, and the clarity you always brought to our performances with you there. You've given your heart to the faith that music can save us all, and that's been part of my own faith which has kept me on my own musical journey for so many years. And almost every year you've been there, it's been your birthday - with cake, good friends, and good spirits back stage! Lots of good memories. I send you a GRAND Kerrville hug, and a thank you for your special musical magic and your belief in the best of the human spirit. ​ - Lindsay Haisley Dear Bethany and Christopher and family: Your father, Peter, is a gem of a human being and musician. He is a national treasure. I was just listening to \"Light One Candle,\" the Hanukah song, the song about light, and hope and peace in the world. It's such a powerful song and the perfect message for today even though it was written in the 1980s. I literally just played it on my guitar (yesterday) for my entire acting class! It is new to them. But see how we are carrying on your father's music and message? Whether with Peter, Paul and Mary, or as Peter Yarrow, he will live forever. Of this I am sure. We love you, Peter! The whole world loves you. We are holding your hand, standing with you, by you, always. We won't let the light go out. ​ - Wendy Gavis-Lainjo My sister and I grew up with Peter, Paul & Mary - mom would play them in the car on the way to protests against the Iraq War. Peter's voice on Blowin' in the Wind, The Magi, and of course Puff is pure magic and will always be part of my childhood. A Holiday Celebration will always be one of my all-time favorite recordings - the power, heart, and spectrum of emotion on the album are aw-inspiring, always. I got to hang with Peter at Old John's Diner the same week I started my masters degree at Juilliard - multiple dreams coming true at once. I'll never forget my friend Larry Long (who is known as \"the Pete Seeger of Minnesota\") happening to call, and me being able to pick up and say \"Larry, guess who I'm having lunch with right now?!\". Peter also invited me to have dinner and hear him sit in with the John Miller band in midtown, and to see the first run of a new opera by Carmen Moore, where I met the incredible Danish vocalist Lotte Arnsbjerg, who was starring. I never doubted that Peter would be a beautiful person from listening to his music, but I was somehow still surprised by just how kind and generous of spirit he is. He so so clearly wanted nothing but the best for me from the moment he hugged me when we met, and he has gone out of his way to connect me with amazing people. Peter - thanks for looking out for me! You're one of the best to ever do it, and you've done it for the right reasons. Your music is the sound of hope, your voice the spirit of kinship and humanity. I will never stop hipping cats to your songs and trying to follow in your footsteps as an artist who inspires change! ​ - Will Kjeer Dear Peter, wonderful fellow Tellurider, My first experience hearing you sing and play music was when I was a bright-eyed little child listening to you, as Peter, Paul and Mary! My mom had gotten me the delightful record album, \"Peter, Paul and Mommy\" and oh how I loved \"Puff the Magic Dragon\", and still do! My sweet memory is of listening and singing along while I propped up the opened album cover in front of me and bent it back and forth to make the photo of the three young children on the cover \"dance\" while I listened and sang! (I thought they were so cute and lucky!) ...Many years later, my husband-to-be and I were invited to a neighbor's holiday party where you were there as a guest, too! We shared with you in our excitement we were to be married soon in February and how we'd selected Paul's \"Wedding Song\" to be played at our wedding ceremony! You gave us a very special, cherished, personalized honor and asked the party hosts if they had a guitar. They did and you played and sang \"Wedding Song\" to us! We were ecstatic and deeply touched, awed by your kindness, and it seemed to us, an understanding of how much the song meant for us. Your gift of singing for us elevated our feelings of love as high as the snow covered mountains all around us! It was sheer exciting fun, and it truly was absolute divine enchantment for us! I'm speaking for both myself and for my beloved, late husband, Tim, your warmth, unique talents, softness and strength given to us from the open kindness of your beautiful heart has been an absolute treasure in this precious life. Thank you, Peter. Sending you a bear hug and Love, Amy Cannon I arrived in Kerrville in 1989 and created the first massage therapy office in, then, the only health club here. Soon after, became Rod Kennedy’s therapist for his remaining 25 years. I first met Peter in 1990 @ his birthday celebration held at Rod’s little cottage, backstage of the Kerrville Folk Festival. Peter’s birthdate (May 31) just happened to be midway through the 18-day KFF, and he was there almost every year until 2020, when Covid shut down nearly all gatherings. Over the many years, sometimes we could fit in his birthday massage but, if not, still cherished spending time together as we circulated the KFF theater…eating, laughing and visiting with ALL of the people that would stop us to share their stories of how he, along with Noel & Mary, had changed their lives…he ALWAYS took the time to give them his true, undivided attention and love ❤️ For the past many years, I’ve been privileged to be Peter’s concierge buddy during his Kerrville visits. We have become close friends with kindred spirits of activism…mine happens to be largely environmental. As my teacher, Peter has helped me to be less aggressively warrior-like… instead, more lovingly assertive. He has been a constant presence in my heart and mind as I continue the journey of stewardship for our beloved natural world ~ I still frequently, and know I will always, ask myself “What would Peter do?” 😁 I’ve sent a 2018 photo of his birthday lunch @ the YO Hotel… Wearing his Birthday Crown 👑 please note the ‘scepter’ of salt shaker, spoon and fork! What a funny guy!!! 🤣 Oh how I love this man who has been a presence in my life since I was a very young child…my older brother listened to PPM nearly constantly in the early ‘60’s as he learned to play guitar. Little did I know that my life would be so profoundly blessed with the honor of getting to know Peter and the privilege of he being my friend 💗 Barbara Burton Kerrville I met Peter after a Peter Paul and Mary concert back in 1963 at Illinois State University. It was so special because I hung out with them in the parking lot waiting for Peter who was late so I got to talk with Paul Stookey and see Mary and her boyfriend xxxx’ing! Haha! Finally Peter came out and said a few kind words as well. I was so blown away as a freshman and new to college and folk music and just want to add that their made my musical direction. I formed a trio at ISU called the Innsiders who became the most popular folk group around. We moved up to Chicago area and did numerous coffee houses, TV shows and big private engagements. I want to thank Peter for his beautiful gifts of music and humor and bless him with prayers for good health. It was such a wonderful experience to see an meet him and PPM. It changed my life!! God Bless! ​ - Richard Robertson I really wish I had a story to share that just involves Peter but I only knew of him through Peter, Paul and Mary. I was first introduced to the group in the early to mid 1960s by my older sister. She was a university student at the time and those were the pre hippie, pre Beatle days of coffee houses and hootenannies. I loved all the music…..as long as it was musical and I could sing along, I loved it. Fast forward to my “grown up” days, I never had the chance to see them in concert. But, I loved the PBS specials that were on a few times a year. I made sure I was able to watch every time. And, I know, I watched a few of them more than once. The camaraderie and love that the three showed each other was obvious. They fed off each other's energy. There are so many songs it's hard to pick a favourite. Day is Done is very high on my list. I know it was written as an anti VietNam war song, but the lyrics are still relevant today, 55 years later. Both the melody and words are haunting. I'm so saddened to hear that Peter, your Dragon, is not doing well. I hope he is not struggling too much. I wish him peace and comfort. I have yet to read all your updates, I know I will shed a tear. The tears seem to flow much easier the older I get. Many, many thanks for the lifetime of music Peter and his “pals” have provided. There is nothing that compares. To the family (and those like family) I wish comfort and acceptance. Cherish the memories…..I know there are many. When the time comes, soft journey Peter. You will be remembered, you will be missed. ​ - Di Brown I was raised on the music of PP&M and it profoundly shaped my conscience and commitment to social action. I have been involved in the human rights advocacy field for 25 years and I can trace a direct line from this work to the music of my childhood. Back when I was 18, I took a bus from NY to OH to see Peter perform at Oberlin College. I had the chance to greet him afterward and told him that his music and work had made me a dreamer. He gifted me with an enormous hug. It was a very special moment for me and is locked in my memory. It is not often you get a chance to meet people who have shaped your life so profoundly and to find them to be the warm and generous person you hoped they would be. Thank you, Peter, for giving all of us so much joy through your music, and for waking up our discomfort with injustice, and for encouraging us to light one candle against the darkness. With love and gratitude, Eileen Campbell Dear Peter - When my daughter went through cancer, you did a private concert online for her, her husband and precious new baby. You sang your beautiful song “With Your Face To the Wind.” Your inspiring lyrics and words of encouragement meant so much to us. You gave us all strength. We now send the same back to you, Peter and those words….“With your face to the wind, I know you’ll be smiling again.” Remember Peter you are an illuminating gift to us all. Your kind heart has brightened and lifted spirits of so many going through challenges and cancer. We send our heartfelt love and gratitude to you - for you are like the wind. You have fought the fight. Please be reassured that your incredible life and magical music has made you a winner and helped others stay strong even when they are up against the wind and life’s unknowns. We see you smiling again. Your endless world of fans and friends send you hugs, gratitude and our deepest appreciation. Much love always dearest Peter and thank you for your limitless kindness and caring. Sincerely, Robyn Dear Peter, This is Aaron Shneyer, the director of Heartbeat, the Israeli-Palestinian youth music project. We first met years ago at the Sabreen studios where I got to witness you, Said Murad, and David Broza doing the highly abnormal and yet simply human act of creating music together. Your deep respect and affection for one another brought me great hope, and still does, and has served as a model for what we must continue creating -- opportunities for Israeli and Palestinian musicians to know each other and create together. I also had the honor to share a stage with you multiple times, at Georgetown University and at the Seeds of Peace event in New York City. I'm so grateful for your consistent and unwavering presence and commitment to peacebuilding. I want you to know that your work continues. Your light continues. With love, hub, ahava, salaam, shalom, Aaron I first met Peter in the late 80s when I waitressed at a restaurant that he frequented in Telluride. He was always a PURE JOY to see, full of love and genuine tenderness. Being in my young 20s and far from home, I wasn't receiving that many loving hugs or heart-centered warmth from my ski bum community. I know that Peter was like this with everyone he came across, but he made me feel like I rightly deserved this singular attention from him...like I was the special recipient of his boundless love. A couple of decades later, I got to spend a little more time with him after lucking into giving his granddaughter Valentina ski lessons and getting to know Peter's whole family. That was when I realized that the warmth from Peter was as strong and unwavering as ever. Peter thank you for enriching ALL of our lives. I'm sure I'm not the only one that is trying to emulate your radiance. ​ - Angela Mallard I am deeply saddened to read of Peter's battle with the evil cancer but hopeful that my story of my long (from afar) admiration and deep appreciation for the gifts he has shared with me and the whole world. For me, it started in the mid 1960's with, I think, it was a PP&M TV appearance, singing \"If I Had a Hammer\" ... that led to album after album purchases. Then I taught myself to play guitar, got involved with \"Folk Masses\" in an Episcopal Church in Evanston, Illinois. I started introducing more secular music to the staid congregation, and somewhere around 1970-ish (?) the Rector sent me to Atlanta where Peter was leading a workshop in audience (congregation) participation singing. He was magnificent, as always ... so inspiring, so genuine, so humble ... I feel myself back there as if it were happening just in this moment! Fast forward to about 1991/1992 - Peter was one of the judges at the Napa Valley Emerging Songwriters Contest, where my wife had submitted two songs and had been accepted to perform them. Peter was in the parking lot as we approached the entrance, and I asked him if he would sign my guitar, and he graciously did! A few years later all our musical equipment was stolen from our garage and sold at a Flea Market ... The most devastating loss, for me, was that guitar with his signature! Several years later, in Portland, Oregon, I heard an advertisement on an AM radio station that he would be performing that evening at his son, Christopher's store The Monkey and the Rat. (Mind you, I NEVER listen to AM radio - that was a 'fluke' but clearly a message from the universe that I would have another opportunity to reconnect. I was Over the Moon with excitement!!!) I took my 12string Taylor guitar to the event. I hung on every word, every note of every song he sang in the first half. Then, I held back, waiting, during intermission while Peter chatted with all the wonderful people there to hear him. Finally I was the last one there, holding my guitar. I mentioned that he had signed my first guitar several years back, in Napa, CA, and asked if he would sign this one for me as well. To my enormous surprise and joy, he not only offered to sign this one, but asked my permission to play it during the second half of the show!!! I thought my heart would BURST! I couldn't believe my good fortune! The next day, I actually took the guitar to work with me (I was working at Nike at the time), and I set it on a conference table where I was awaiting a meeting with someone I had never actually met before, but we were starting a joint effort on (? who remembers now :)! Steve Young was my colleague's name and when he walked into the conference room, of course he immediately noticed the guitar, looked at me, and said, \"OH, that was YOUR guitar that Peter played last night!\" What are the chances that we would both be at the concert and then meet the next day for the first time? So, that is my story ... I have performed so many of his and the group's songs over the years, both alone and with my singing partner. Additionally, I led a small group of teens and we did many, many of my favorites, including \"Very Last Day\", \"Weave Me The Sunshine\", \"Because All Men Are Brothers\", \"The Hammer Song\", \"Puff\" to be sure ... and many, many more ... Four of my most favorites are \"Such is Love\", \"Music Speaks Louder than Words\" \"Light One Candle\" and \"The Great Mandella\". I have long recognized and appreciated his (and Noel Paul & Mary's) commitment to Peace and Equality ... they are outstanding in a troubled world. I will miss him terribly, but comforted by the music which lives on in all our hearts. Sending prayers for comfort and peace from Eugene, OR, I remain one of his most dedicated fans, Pam Briggs ... When my daughter, Kaleigh, who is now 28 years old, was about five years old or so, we took her to her first Peter, Paul, & Mary concert at the Westbury Music Fair in Nassau County, L.I. It is a theater in the round and had a tradition of allowing children to be invited up onto the stage. Often the little ones would give flowers to Mary. My daughter was fortunate to do so at either her first or second concert. Mary was so kind to her and as always all the kids. My daughter fell in love with P, P, & M and listened to their music for many years as she grew older. Several years ago, when she was in her 20’s my daughter in turn bought a set of tickets for the three of us to Peter on his own at the NYC Winery. She loves him, his music, and most of all the kindness in his words and presence. At the show, Peter spent time mingling and talking with members of the audience. My daughter and wife & I got to talk with him and tell him of our family relationship to his music and of course P, P, & M. He was so moved by the reminiscing about the Westbury Music Fair concerts and the children coming onto the stage with flowers for Mary. He was visibly struck by the memories and was so genuinely kind to my daughter, hugging us all. As I write about these memories, I too am deeply moved and so very grateful for Peter, his music, but most importantly for the person he was as an activist and humanitarian. Thank You for all you have given to so many, myself included. And thank you for helping to raise my daughter through the music and all the kindness. Best Regards with much love to you, Peter, and your family. -Brian Burke I will always be grateful for the many generous gestures Peter extended to our Newtown, CT community, and our Flagpole Radio Cafe show, among other things we did together. I will always cherish the first time he was the guest artist on the Flagpole Radio Cafe and he invited us to play with him. It was the beginning of a great friendship. He hilariously asked the audience if this was the Tadpole Radio Soufflé. We played many concerts in the years to come that I will never forget. Peter (or Pietro as he called himself) was a hero when the Sandy Hook tragedy happened. He came to Newtown and together we engaged the families to provide support, especially for our cherished friends, Francine and David Wheeler. We created a concert for healing that became a PBS special with me and Peter getting credit for producing the concert. The credit was secondary to my experience that this was Peter showing me how to bring people together, how to organize and respond, how to lead with love. The audience was filled with the grieving families, the first responders, and the school staff. We played the most emotional concert I have ever been a part of, culminating with Peter leading us in We Will Overcome. We stood in line, locking our arms together, and with tears sang for and with all the people. We were invited, and Peter agreed, to go play and sing for the law enforcement officers who were the first responders. They were hesitant, but eventually, Peter got them singing. It was incredible. Later, one of the fathers of the Sandy Hook children took his own life and it was an overwhelming event for the community. I called Peter and asked him to come. He said, “Brodskala (as he would call me sometimes in his haimasha way) pick me up at the train station”. Peter and Bethany led our group in song for a couple of hours. I have never felt so whole because of music than that moment. And lastly, and more personally, I appreciate the private conversations with Peter when my father passed, and when Pete Seeger (for whom I worked for at the Clearwater Festival)passed. Peter has been a very generous and inspiring figure in my life and within my close friends in Connecticut and at Clearwater. Peter, Pietro, my Dragon friend I will always have a special place in my heart and a lot of love for you!! ​ - Rick Brodsky In the 1980s I lived and worked in New York and had the privilege of singing in the New York Choral Society under Bob DeCormier. In 1987, I was in the chorus for the annual holiday concert at Carnegie Hall with PPM, and one of the songs we sang was “Light One Candle”. It quickly became a favorite of mine and I still remember the alto part to this day. In 2011, Peter and Paul did a concert at the Birch Aquarium in San Diego, and I attended with my husband. Peter sang “Light One Candle” and I sang along with the audience on the alto line. After the concert, I sought out Peter and told him I had sung with them in 1987. He stopped in his tracks and gave me the biggest hug. That was 13 years ago and I remember it like it was yesterday. I’ve loved his voice since I was a kid in the 60s and I will always have a candle lit in his honor in my heart. Thank you, Peter, for your heart, your voice, your compassion, your activism. You will always be one of my heroes. With love, Karen Patterson I am 60 years old and grew up on Peter, Paul and Mary's music. We introduced our children, now 26 and 24, to your wonderful music and had the privilege of taking them to see the tribute concert in Sarasota, FL after Mary passed away. We baked sugar cookies stamped with peace doves, and brought them to the concert. As usual, Peter graciously came out after the concert and met with the fans, staying until the last one left. My daughter handed him the gift box of cookies and surprisingly, Peter opened the box, commented on the beautiful peace doves on the cookies, and ate one! We were so touched at his trust and enthusiasm, and my daughter still remembers that moment when she \"got to meet Mr. Peter!\" Thank you for sharing your beautiful nature and character with the world, Peter. You have impacted the world more than you know. God bless you and your family. ​ - Sue Willingham Dear Peter, Growing up in the 60's was magical. When PP&M came onto the scene, they quickly became my favorite, and 62 years later, still are. Your music soothed me, your words moved me. Together, they spoke to me, to my heart, to my soul. Your messages, ideals, and actions influenced and inspired me. Memories made many years ago pop up in my mind by association when I hear your songs today. I had the great pleasure to have seen you in concert (as PP&M, Peter & Paul, and Peter solo) many dozens of times at various venues in many states. Throughout the years, I attended the concerts with friends and family, then with my own four children, then with my grandchildren, two of whom you chose, at different concerts, to sing Puff with you onstage. L'dor v'dor. Thank you, Peter, with love, for all you gave to me, personally, and for all you have given to the world. Your legacy will live on through the generations. Your memory will always be for a blessing. Marilyn Wolf Jordan Hello Peter I have heard you have some health problems and am hoping someone can read this to you. I want to tell you what an inspiration you are, and how I value your friendship. Your songs and the convictions expressed in them had a very real effect on me before we ever met, as part of what made me a conscientious objector in 1972, and that as a singer and songwriter I could make a difference. A year later, in 1973, I opened for you at Max's Kansas City for a week; it was my first real booking, and nervous as I was, I've never forgotten how welcome you made me feel. I didn't know then that's simply who you are! And there’s the time when I didn't show up for Kerrville's songwriter contest, you had me write to Rod Kennedy; the next year he booked me as a paid artist. In Washington DC we were there to sing at a rally and the organizers were blowing off the music; I asked to sing a song and you said \"I'll sing it with him\" and that settled that. Or the time I had to follow you on Pete Fornatale's Hungerthon; instead of leaving after your set, you stuck around and sang mine with me, unrehearsed, live on the radio. Or the numerous times you asked me to sing with you, at Kerrville, or Oscar Brand's tribute concert, or backstage at the Kravis Center, when you handed me your guitar and said \"Play us a song, Rod.\" You even showed up for my 50th anniversary party online and blew everyone's mind talking about our friendship. Singing with you has always been a fantastic experience, fun, spontaneous and exciting. I can't say enough about how you have inspired me, first with your--and Noel and Mary's--beautiful music, and when you said to me backstage at the 1988 Greenwich Village Folk Festival that you were inspired by us, carrying on the tradition you had taken up earlier. Through these years I have proudly told people we are friends, and now I want to say to you thank you, for your music, for your wonderful singing, and for being a wonderful friend indeed. God bless you Peter, you have enriched so many lives, both from the stage and in person, and I will always treasure the moments we’ve spent together. Rod MacDonald I met Peter not through his music or my being a NY area AM Radio DJ (and huge fan of PP&M) but we were in attendance at the same event during one of the darkest times of my life in NYC. Peter, having overheard me speaking came up to me and casually, with the care and the sincerity he always exuded spoke to me as if he were a big brother. For those moments and many from then on, one candle was lit. But, what I learned is that all it takes to see your way through the darkest forrest is just one candle, and to keep that candle lit. Thank you, Peter for that \"miracle on 34th Street\" and for all that moment and you have given me throughout my life. May your jouney always be peaceful and may you be rewarded many-fold for all the joy you have brought to countless others, B\"H! I hold you near and dear. REFUAH SHLEMA! ​ - Len Schwartz “There is only one river. There is only one sea. And it flows through you, and it flows through me. There is only one people. We are one and the same. We are all one spirit. We are all one name.” - Peter Yarrow (Peter, Paul, and Mary) “When people sing together, community is created. Together we rejoice, we celebrate, we mourn and we comfort each other. Through music, we reach each others’ hearts and souls. Music allows us to find a connection. - Peter Yarrow As I write, I am gazing upon a photograph of Peter, Paul & Mary with Pete Seeger at a legendary concert at Carnegie Hall in 2003. \"If you love your country, you'll find ways somehow to speak out to do what you think is right.\" - Pete Seeger Peter Yarrow has always had the courage to speak out. This afternoon, I am remembering a special day in my life. When I was teaching at Abington Friends School in Pennsylvania, I had the opportunity to spend a brief moment in time with Peter Yarrow. Peter, Paul, and Mary were performing at the Keswick Theater in the evening, but Peter came over to Abington Friends earlier in the day to spend some time with our students. The Lower and Middle School students came over to the Mueller Auditorium for an impromptu musical gathering. Peter called up the youngest students on stage and instantaneously a wonderful and jubilant choir was formed. Peter had been on stage for only a few minutes when his fingers started strumming the melody to “Puff the Magic Dragon” on his guitar. Many of the students weren’t old enough to recognize the legendary folk singer, but they knew his music, particularly the classic song about the mighty dragon and his departed playmate Jackie Paper. As he played throughout his spontaneous concert, Peter spoke about the ideas of mutual respect and personal responsibility. “It says it starts with bullying, it starts with pushing ridicule, making fun of someone, and it builds to racism, prejudice, hatred, war, Holocaust. If we want to interrupt the cycle, educators are a critical force in this.” – Peter Yarrow In 2000, Peter founded Operation Respect, a New York-based non-profit that works to combat childhood bullying. \"I keep reminding people that an editorial in rhyme is not a song. A good song makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you think.\" - Pete Seeger Click the link below to experience Peter Yarrow’s beautiful rendition of a good song - “Don’t Laugh at Me”. ​ - Bob Wolpert I've known Peter for many years now, and my many moments with him are the honor of my life! Needless to say, I am sad that he is leaving us, but grateful for his amazing time in this realm, and so fortunate for me that our orbits have crossed so many times. My life is all the richer for those encounters. They include many times at The Kerrville Folk Festival, both in late night song circles and on main stage with Peter as his bass player. Needless to say, what greater thrill could there be than to be playing the iconic \"Puff The Magic Dragon\" with the legend himself! But the teaching moment that most sticks in my memory and in my being is in 1981 when I put together a show, for which I'm extremely proud, at The Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles called \"Survival Sunday.\" It was to get out the message of the dangers of nuclear energy, particularly the further creation of nuclear power plants. My part was to put together a musical lineup that would fill The Hollywood Bowl to its 18,000 capacity....and that I did. But along with the MUSIC was THE MESSAGE, so that after each act's 20 minute performance time, there would be several speakers, each with a 2 minute limit so that the show could end on time....which after 5 hours, it did! One of the amazing speakers was PETER YARROW. I had heard that Peter tended to talk for a long time (which it turns out is true, but only when it's his show and he has the flexibility to do it). So I, in my authoritative naiveté, went up to him, right before he went on, and dictated that he must keep his talk to 2 minutes or less. Understandably, with my abrupt delivery, Peter was upset and felt discounted (rightfully so in retrospect!)...and he let me know it! As it turned out, and as you might have already guessed, Peter spoke eloquently and succinctly, all within the 2 minute boundary. For a long time, I felt bad about my having discounted him so, but years later at The Kerrville Folk Festival, I recounted that moment from years before, made my amends, and Peter could not have been more gracious in his forgiveness. We became good friends, we've had many beautiful moments together both on stage and off, and he will remain one of my all time musical heroes. So to YOU, PETER, I say goodbye, sweet journey to wherever it is we go when we pass on, and thank you so very much for your gifts over the years and the honor it has been for my soul to have been touched by your amazing energy, grace, music, and love. You deserve \"a standing ovation, a celebration, for a job well done!\" Enjoy the journey, my friend! Peace, FREEBO My parents shared the joy of Peter, Paul, and Mary with me when I was just a wee little girl, full of health and joy, and as avid fans, they brought my sister and me to a performance in New Orleans when I was 3 or 4 in 1984 or 1985. I was the biggest fan of Puff the Magic Dragon and could sing it word for word, even as a little kid. I was lucky enough to be invited up on stage as a little kiddo, and I remember Peter singing Puff, and he started singing, \"Puff the Magic Dragon, lives by the bed,\" and in my toddler indignance, I said, \"NO NO NO, THAT'S NOT HOW IT GOES!\". The whole audience erupted in laughter, and we sang the song \"the right way!\" together. This story has been told many times over the years, and it makes me giggle, even now. As a child who has since grown into a casual musician, these types of interactions with the audience and families are unforgettable and have a lasting impact. I'm so thankful to have had the experience as a child and still listen to their music as an adult over 40 years later. Thank you for inviting us to share our stories. I wish Peter and your family peace and comfort, and let him know we shall be brave and keep the fearless roar going. ​ - Marian Toro Dear Peter, Twenty-eight years ago today, Herman Philips, a dear friend of my father and member of the NY Choral Society, brought me to a PPM rehearsal for your 1996 holiday concert. I met you, Noel, and Mary that evening, and had the heart-gift of being able to thank you, hug you. \"Sweetheart,\" I remember you saying to me. At the end of the rehearsal, I gathered the nerve to approach you and ask whether I could take a photo with you. I never had such a joyous smile as in that treasured picture. For you had already begun to etch justice and hope, peace and purpose and love, into my heart. I had grown up watching your early PBS concerts. And since I got my first PPM cassette and CD three years before that winter night in Riverside Church, and ever since, you have been a nearly daily presence in my life. I would love to talk to you now and tell you all about the role so many of your songs have had in my life -- Take the Chance, Sweet Survivor, Light One Candle, the Great Mandala, Don't Laugh at Me, and on, and on, and on. But I know you have countless more tributes to hear. So I will let you go now, soon to melt into the stars and the sea, and join the flow of that River Jordan. You will never leave my heart. Love & Peace, Forever and Forever, Eric A. Friedman I have been thinking of Peter lately, just somehow knowing that he is not well. I am writing to send my love and gratitude. Not that long ago, Peter came to my community in Burlington, Vermont to offer a concert to our congregation. Peter’s generosity was extraordinary. We were all very inspired by his warmth, his message, his teaching us through song and story, and his heartfelt music. The concert will forever be a very dear memory. I was a devoted fan from my youth, when I would sit in my room and sing to Peter, Paul and Mary recordings—this was the soundtrack of my youth. Having enjoyed Peter, Paul and Mary concerts and then a solo performance Peter gave in New Jersey years ago, I couldn’t get enough — to this day, I am always singing his songs. When I had the chance to meet Peter through a mutual friend, it was an uplifting, memorable life moment. Two of my adult children were blessed to be with us when Peter came to Burlington. After I picked him up from the airport, he came to my home for lunch, which was also my son’s birthday. We cut the birthday cake and Peter sang a song he made up in that moment, to wish Judah happy birthday. I still open the recording on my phone when I want to be uplifted. That evening, Peter sang at our synagogue and, to say it was glorious barely begins to capture how wonderful it was. The messages in Peter’s songs and the caring he conveyed through story and song were an inspiration and a direction towards the sacred work of repairing the world, spreading love and friendship. Jewish mystical tradition says that in every generation there are 36 uniquely sacred souls—those who rise above the muck of the world and bring us closer to wholeness/holiness. I’d say Peter was one of them. Peter was also very funny — when I picked him up at the hotel in Burlington, a woman noticed him as he waited for the elevator. After staring for a moment, she proclaimed, “Are you Peter, Paul and Mary?!” Without missing a beat, Peter smiled and said, “Yes, all three.” ​ - Amy Small Peter and I have crossed paths several times over the years, including in 1987 at a demonstration on behalf of Soviet Jewry in DC at the U.S. Capitol Building, where he and Mary Travers performed on stage with Elie Wiesel, and many former Refuseniks. He performed at the Isla Mujeres Folk Festival in Mexico in the Fall of 1990. While there with Chris, we sang songs together on a three-masted schooner, and enjoyed sailing near sunset. His songs have been a part of my life since childhood, and I taught his songs to many children, sang them at concerts, rallys, and demonstrations. He is a part of my life, and through the ripples of influence of his spirit and music, will live forever through his music and good works. - Janice Rubin Pedro, Outside of Jenni, Carol z”l, my mom and dad and precious few others, you have influenced who I am today. I join millions of others, of course, who grew up with the music from Noel’s belting out “Early in the Morning” to Pete Seeger’s anthem “If I Had a Hammer” which you and the trio democratized, as you did with Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind”. I begin with the music because I know you self-identify as an artist first. My two most meaningful, of course, being “Light One Candle”, which you dedicated to Jenni and her Wash U. roommates at a PP&M Fox Theater gig in St. Louis, and “Day is Done” which you lovingly sang in memory of Carol at her shiva. But then there’s the “activist” Peter. Few people have had our mutual connection. I worked for Al Lowenstein on the Hill and on several of his quixotic races, and likewise you campaigned and sang for him at his funeral and, it was fitting, that you, my brother, were the inaugural recipient of the Allard K. Lowenstein Memorial Award. Pedro, we met for the first time 30+ years ago when, out of nowhere, Marc Geist calls to ask if “one Peter Yarrow” can travel to Columbus to meet me. Huh? Why? And why me? You were just beginning to think through Operation Respect — and I wasn’t daunted by raising money from business “machers” (as even the captains of industry grew up with the music). Turns out you show up with guitar in hand at a quiet Italian restaurant here in Columbus packed by lovers because it was Valentine’s Day. Carol was with me, and you began strumming the first chords of “Leaving on a Jet Plane”; you sang it to her and tears began flowing, not only hers and mine, but everyone else at the restaurant. When Mary passed you sang it bedside to her; at Carol’s shiva you reprised it. Now we sing it back to you. Pedro … there’s your artistry and there’s your activism. But by a mile, both overshadow your humanity. You are simply incapable of addressing anyone — from teachers and bodega workers to taxi drivers and members of congress — by anything other than “my brother”. I love you, Pedro, because YOU embody Tikkun Olam with every ounce of your being. And I love you because you taught me to love Barney Greengrass Pickled Herring with Cream Sauce. And to both of those, let us say “Dayenu”. Richard Dearest Peter, During the early ‘60s, I saw you-all in concert, and again in the 2000s. “Puff” was always my favorite. My life, like Jackie Paper’s went from an innocent little boy on the prairies of Nebraska and my big old horse “Buck” to a career Army aviator flying much combat and classified surveillance missions resulting in a 100% combat disabled 83 year old veteran. If it were a perfect world, I’d ask you to compose and sing a “final verse” of “ Puff.” A verse where Jackie, in his mid-eighties and on his last legs, would once more venture to Honah Lee and Puff’s cave. Puff , in slumber, opens up his giant eye and recognizes Jackie. He gently raises Jackie up to his giant tail. They once more travel majestically on the boat and fade into the autumn mist of Honah Lee and into the “Great Forevermore.” With Love and Prayers Mike Blacker MAJ USA (ret) In 5th grade (1965), my wonderful teacher (Frank Lyman) played a PP&M record in class and on his own guitar - during class! Though I may not have understood all the words' deeper meaning, even as a 11 yr old, the honesty and truth spoke to me and formed my social conscience which is still with me today. At age 11, I purchased two albums and listened to them (Moving, In the Wind) endlessly on my dad's stereo. Peter, your optimism and genuineness was true in1965 to this little kid, and in 2024 as a 68 y.o. retiree who still plays your songs on his guitar. Words cannot express what you, Noel and Mary have given me my entire life. You gave me an awareness and a sense of social justice and responsibility and tolerance for which I am eternally grateful. I was lucky enough to see you at Thalian Hall in Wilmington, North Carolina at a show several years ago where your son was with you playing a one string washtub bass, I think it was! What a joy to see you and shake your hand after the show! I also saw you and Mary perform at Cornell in 1982 or 83. Thank you for your spirit, wisdom, optimism and of course, fabulous music which formed my (and clearly, very many others) liberal outlook. May God hold you in the palm of his hand. Love, from North Carolina Richard Weisman Dear Peter, Thank you for enriching my life along with your enrichment of all humanity. Our dear friend Puff uplifts, inspires, comforts, and enobles all who remain children at heart, as Puff always will do. Peter, you rank among the righteous who in Jewish tradition keep the world going. The Torah refers to our sages as wise hearted. That's you: your combination of musical genius and deep seated humanity with concern for all, especially children, sets an example and provides inspiration propelling us to do our part to make the world a better, more loving place. Due to you and Operation Respect, victims of bullying will take comfort and courage, and would be bullies will refrain and reform. You remain a friend to millions who never met you but will always sing and humm your songs. But, I count myself so fortunate to have you and your friendship, and that of our mutual friend, Trudy, in my life. I rank among a select few who can say they attended High Holy Day Synagogue services where Peter Yarrow led prayer to the tunes of his folk music. Your encouragement of Sophie Gerson Healthy Youth and your performance at our Gala motivates me and us to reach as many young people as possible - that's why we put Puff the Magic Dragon as background music to our official summer camp video. My mother, the best judge of character I know, thought the world of you. She and I have always deeply appreciated and cherished knowing you and calling you, and Puff, friend. Thank you for being you!!! Love, Alan. Dear Peter, I started listening to Peter, Paul and Mary as a teen in the 60’s. Until I downsized two years ago, I had 20 PP&M albums plus your Peter album—and I played them often. Your music took me through down times, celebrations and everything in between. Long before there were playlists or Spotify, I made myself tapes of my favorite music each year for what I called my birthday tapes, as a gift to myself. I always had 2-3 of your songs on each tape, because your music touched my heart, and I loved listening to it. Your music was also on the tape I made to listen to when I was going through chemo, and needed the glimmers of light and words of hope that you sang. I was fortunate to be able to listen to you live in a number of the concerts you played in Chicago. And when you played at the Illinois Education Association annual meeting and invited us up on stage, that was a special moment for me. I want you to know how grateful I am for the evenings on Zoom when you sang and reminisced at the beginning of the pandemic. The isolation of living alone combined with my anxiety about the pandemic made that a very challenging time for me. Your Zoom sessions offered me a sense of connection and something to look forward to—and they were a lifeline at a time that I badly needed one. Your music has enriched my life and I thank you for the pleasure, support, hope and heartfulness that you have given me for more than 50 years. Sending Love and Light, Leah Shepard Hello Peter. The Dorsey’s from Eagle Lake are thinking, praying and telling stories about the days of swimming at the tower and the sing alongs at the beach fires. An older memory of mine was when you, along with Mary and Paul were performing at Mall of America. After the concert, friends and family joined for a social on the 4th floor. I was included with this, but as the concert ended, I realized that I had lost track of my parents. You 3 were leaving the stage and knowing that I would not get to the 4th floor on my own, my efforts to call your name, “Peter, Pat Dorsey from Willmar.” You grabbed my arm through the crowd and pulled me towards you and told security “family”. I lobbied for a moment to get the group name changed to Peter Paul Mary and Pat, but it didn’t stick. We then rode up the elevator together and had a great catch up moment since we hadn’t seen each other for several years. You cared where I was teaching and what I was doing. You made me feel that I mattered. I always felt that you were one of the most kind, loving, accepting, inclusive ….. people and you’ve made a huge impact on me and many others by being who you are. The Dorsey’s - Dave, DeeAnna, Colleen, Heather, Mike and I send our best well wishes and love to you, Christopher, Bethany, MaryBeth and the rest of your family. Love the Dorsey’s I most clearly remember Peter from rehearsing for the Peter Yarrow Sing-Along PBS special, where he generously invited me (as part of the Walkabout Clearwater Chorus) to join him in his apartment to rehearse. His passion was clearly obvious, and he worked with all of us to sound our best. But I also remember him presenting (with Noel) at a class taught by Mary at the New School in NYC. He spoke of his pride in writing \"Light One Candle\" as a Hanukkah song to \"balance\" with some of the Christmas music. As recently as last night, a friend wrote to my wife and me \"Thank you both for the love, wisdom and support last night. In a better place today. Singing Peter Yarrow's \"Light One Candle\" line \"Let anger not tear us apart!\" Hit home to both (my partner) and me! And we pass it on to the next generation... ​ - Paul Storfer Like many other, PETER YARROW is a musical hero of mine. It was examples set by Peter and Pete Seeger and Harry Chapin that paved the way for less influential folks like myself to follow a course of social and community service with Music When it was time for Woodsong 600th broadcast, I called Peter up and invited him to be the featured artist. As it happened at the same time, Rhonda Vincent was also available. Peter & Rhonda for WoodSongs show 600. And Peter agreed immediately he even purchased his own plane ticket to come to Lexington to be on the show. Just saying it was an epic evening would be an understatement. I say often that \"love is the greatest transaction of the arts\" and few reflected that love more than Peter Yarrow in his music, his social and community efforts and his writing. ￼ ​ - Michael Johnathon I was born in 1958, so my New York City boyhood developed over the couse of the tumultuous 1960s. John, Martin, Bobby, Viet Nam, racial strife, Hard Hats fighting Hippies, Abbie Hoffman, The Chicago Seven . . . and yet, artists like Peter, Paul and Mary kept me believing that there was a functioning love, an imaginative love that endured suffering out there in the world. There were Lemon Trees and Loving Dragons, and Early Morning Rain and they were all Blowing in the Wind. And when you all appeared on television, your words were always inviting people to love one another. It wouldnt be an exaggeration to say I loved you all, your voices, your smiles, your hearts. They were good hearts that I like to think helped “gooden” my own. I am so very grateful Peter, that you were in the world. Your benevolent witness helps me believe even these many decades later that the world is essentially a good place to be alive. I am rich with love and you and your singing friends, Mary and Noel-Paul, Pete and Arlo. John Denver Odette and so many more are some of the reasons why. The life-long friend you didnt know you had, John Ennis. Peter: I was not not born until 1967, so I got on to the folk music scene a little late in the game. But, fortunately, my Dad loves folk music, so I grew up listening to folk music, of which PP&M was the best. I was the only teenager cruising El Camino Real in Santa Clara, CA, in the mid 80’s listening to PP&M. I kick myself for never seeing all three of you in concert, but I did get to see you and Paul perform in Redding, CA, several years ago. Thank you for all the great music, and I thank my Dad for introducing me to it. Tell me why youre smiling my son Is there a secret you can tell everyone? Do you know more than men that are wise? Can you see what we all must disguise through your loving eyes? And if you take my hand my son All will be well when the day is done And if you take my hand my son All will be well when the day is done Day is done, day is done, day is done, day is done ​ - Patrick Hurton On April 25, 2004 there was a PBS gathering at your apartment. I had flown up to it to be my daughter's guest at the event. I had met you a few years before when you were searching for a source for clear plastic thumbpicks. When you learned that the day was also my birthday, you whistled the crowd to silence and had everyone sing \"happy birthday\" to me. Later on that night you sang a rousing \"old father time\" at my request. That was the culmination of a lifetime of pleasure, joy and learning that I received from your work and example, along with Mary's and Noel's. You taught me many things, of life, the guitar and values. You were and are my hero. A good part of what I am today I owe to you. You made such a difference to me and to the world. Carry on, Peter, and may we meet again in another time and place. Thank you, thank you. There is only one river. Peace and Love, John Dear Peter, you are a significant inspiration in my musical life. I’d often sing your part in campfire sing-a-longs growing up and in the groups that I’ve played in. When my kids were young, I was the sing-a-long dad at school with guitar and banjo. On the last day of school (end of term and closure of school) we had a last sing-a-long outside in the dappled sun under the shade trees. I asked the kids what song they would like to sing and keep in their hearts. It was unanimous. We sang Puff. I held my tears back until they were off to their parent’s arms. And then I wept. A rich cathartic soul deep weep. It was for all the times I’ve sung Puff and all the times it has been sung with the earnest hope both for our own innocence and for the beloved circle of friends raising their voices: until we meet again. Thank you for so many truly enduring gifts. ​ - Tom Tower Dear Peter - I played the organ at the Ocean Grove Auditorium twice for P, P&M performances. The first time, our family was in the audience, enjoying the show, and during your solo spot at the beginning of the 2nd half, you looked up at the pipe organ and said \"It sure would be nice to hear this magnificent instrument, if anyone out there knows how to play it\". My wife said she leaned over to whisper to me that I should go up, but I was already on the stage! We did a piece together, \"We Shall Overcome\", I think. At the end of the concert, you asked me to come up again and your trio and I closed with \"Blowin' in the Wind\" I had been a P,P, & M fan since you first released \"If I had a Hammer\" (1962, right?) I went to quite a few of your concerts through the years, and got all your albums as soon as they came out. Playing with you all was the thrill of a lifetime. When we stopped at a gas station in Ocean Grove on our way home, someone from the car next to ours came over and asked me for my autograph! When you next performed at Ocean Grove a couple years later, I wrote you and asked if you would like an organist again. You said sure, and invited me to come to your rehearsal the afternoon of your concert. I was in the \"green room\" with you right before the 2nd half, and I asked you to play your intro to \"This Land is Your Land\" so I would be sure to come in at the right place. You sang the whole intro for me, a private concert, and I will never forget that either. Another memory I have of you is in the winter of 1964, the 3 of you were performing at the huge auditorium in Cherry Hill, NJ. For one of your solos after intermission, you led the audience in \"Rock-a My Soul\". I still marvel at how you effortlessly (at least it seemed like it was) taught 3 different sections of the audience their part in the song, and then put it together, and it was masterful, beautiful, and inspirational. My prayers are with you during your illness. May you know and experience the peace that you gave to millions of people through your music. ​ - Richard Frey Oh, Peter! I was 12 when Santa brought me my first guitar, a Ward's Airline, because my older sister asked for one! I was also fortunate that her being a teen in the 60's, she went to concerts and brought all the PPM albums for me to listen to! So, as I told you in Brethren, Michigan last summer, I've been part of the Puff legacy for more than 50 years, playing and singing with family, including nieces and nephews, kids I babysat, church and school friends, at college coffeehouses, schools where I taught, and at parent programs, library story hours, of course with my own kids and now grandkids (who are loving your book you gave us), and even when we're singing favorites - at impromptu jams at a campground or festival or with friends and family - and those loved by our loved ones passing/passed. We hold you in the Light of Love and Peace. Franny Holly and Rick DeZeeuw Dear Peter, I was quite saddened to hear of your illness and I do hope you can regain your strength to fight this thing! I met you in 2007 at Barnes & Noble in Los Angeles when our mutual friend, Sharmagne, invited me to go with her to meet you. When she introduced us, you looked at me with a knowing look. You seemed to have recognized me and asked when we had previously met. Although I had been to a few PP&M concerts in my earlier years, we had never actually met prior to this time. Regardless, you greeted me like an old friend and gave me a warm hug. It was always a joy to see you perform and to sing your songs throughout my life. Meeting you reaffirmed all my previous feelings about you that you are a genuine mensch! Thank you for your music, your beautiful spirit, and for being an inspiration in these difficult times. And thanks for posing for some wonderful photos. With love, Michael Pliskin I'm 76 and I have seen you every time PP&M came to Pittsburgh. The Syria Mosque where you performed was across the street from my college dorm and in my freshman year, my roommate and I risked breaking curfew to stay to the end of your concert. We ran to the back door toward the end, so we'd be ready for a quick exit and then RAN as only college kids can run (can't imagine doing that at our age now!), across the street and collapsed in a heap right inside the door of our dorm as we JUST made it. One of my favorite memories came from a concert some 15 or so years later was when our 3 year old daughter fell asleep in my arms, when we sat in the 3rd or 4th row, and awakened as you sang Puff the Magic Dragon. Mary pointed to her and we were thrilled! Rest well, Peter. You children's project is such a testiment of love for you and for your fans. Peace be with you. ​ - Cheryl McLaughlin I'm 76 and I have seen you every time PP&M came to Pittsburgh. The Syria Mosque where you performed was across the street from my college dorm and in my freshman year, my roommate and I risked breaking curfew to stay to the end of your concert. We ran to the back door toward the end, so we'd be ready for a quick exit and then RAN as only college kids can run (can't imagine doing that at our age now!), across the street and collapsed in a heap right inside the door of our dorm as we JUST made it.

Mary pointed to her and we were thrilled! Rest well, Peter. You children's project is such a testiment of love for you and for your fans. Peace be with you. ​ - Cheryl McLaughlin Peter and I know each other through his Toyota Land Cruisers. My business in Delta, CO repaired and maintained his 2 FJ60s over the years. When Peter stopped being able to travel to Telluride, he sold one of them to me. “Puff” as we call it now serves our family in the same role of trusty steed that it did for Peter, Christopher, family and friends for many years. Peter and I had the opportunity to talk Land Cruisers several times over the years, but the conversations were never technical for long. He had a way of steering the conversation towards much more inspirational content! We talked about the spirit of these vehicles we both love. He explained that he believed they were sentient beings that could complain, and rejoice, and I agreed with him. We talked about how people should treat each other, and the conversations were always filled with love. They were indeed magical. It’s odd that a simple car can connect people in such a deep and meaningful way, but I will be forever grateful for the relationship and connection I have with Peter because of them. ​ - Jeremiah Proffitt I began to learn guitar & to sing folk songs vs just church music, back when I was 16 because of you & PP&M & others back then. I'm 77 now & I still love your music! Lately, I've been auditing a songwriting class, as I'm keeping on keeping on just like you! Prayers & Blessings for your Shalom & total well-being! - Julia Collins Peter helped shape and inform my values and consciousness from the beginning of my childhood, with love and meaning. Such a gift! One which will continue to guide me for the rest of my life. Please know how much you are appreciated and loved, dear Peter. - Fay Lipschultz I don’t remember exactly when I listened to my first Peter Paul & Mary song (I am 70) but your music has been part of my life for at least 50 years. I must have heard and sung Puff the Magic Dragon a few hundred times and now I sing it to my grandchildren. I love your Christmas Album A Holiday Celebration, It starts my season of Christmas music every year. I wish you peace and freedom from pain. I want you to know that your music brought joy to my life. - Cora Sterling Peter, you have been a part of my musical life for close to 60 years. I started singing your music in the 60s and have done so all of my adult life. I sang your music at my mom’s funeral and at rallies in Milwaukee and across the mid-west. Your music has been a touchstone in my own long life and there is no way I can tell you how much it has meant to me other than to say… Thank you! As you continue on your own life’s journey, Peter, know that your life means something to people like me, your brother in music and in this life. Bless you, and keep you all the days of your earthly life! - H Smith I have loved and treasured your music since I was small, and I'm now 66 years old. As part of the bedtime ritual, we sang Puff with the children, and If I Had a Hammer, and so many other songs that you created or enhanced. I have always respected that you walked the walk politically and socially as a good human being. I thank you for being that sort of quiet role model. I'm sure you've been told this often, but I met you once. We were at Don't Tell Mama, and you were incredibly kind. I treasure that memory (I was even wearing a dragon necklace!) and so very, very many others. Thank you, thank you, thank you. - Maya Amis My grandmother gave me an 8 track tape of Peter, Paul and Mommy in 1976 when I was 6 years old. I fell in love with it and memorized every word of every song. Leatherwing Bat has always been my favorite, even at 54 years old. Now I have a 2 year old grandson, and every day when he lays down to take a nap, I play All Through the Night on repeat while he falls asleep, and he loves it so much as he cuddles his stuffed animals. I want to thank you for giving me the soundtrack of my life, the decades of wonderful concert memories, and for being such a beautiful example of love for humankind. - Bess Uitermark Thank you for the music and the magic. ​ - Sherry Boullt I first heard Blowin in the wind in Catholic grade school in the 60s. That song is a beacon of hope throughout my life. I feel blessed to have seen Peter, Paul and Mary together and then Peter and Paul. I wish Peter the best in his battle with cancer. Praying for him and hoping for peace and love to guide him on this journey. - Anne Dougherty Bob and I owe you so much. We will light one candle for you on Sunday with our congregation's kids at Ohef Sholom Temple's Chanukah Around the World celebration. Your gifts to the world help ensure that the light won't go out, especially when we teach this to our children. Bless you, Peter! ​ - Jeanne Zentz Peter, What wonderful music! I grew up listening to Peter, Paul and Mary! Thank you for the legacy! May God comfort you Peter Yarrow. - Susan McDaniel Music by your father, and Paul and Mary have been the center of my life. They taught me to be the kind of person I want to be. Accepting, tolerant with love for all. - Janice Center of my soul is the music you have gifted to us all. The book and song \"Don't Laugh At Me\" has been such a one. I was privileged to see you in MPLS years ago when it was released. I work with young children daily and they benefit from this message. It carries onward. Knowing we are all precious and 'all the same' in God's eyes. We need to be the same in everyone's eyes now. We need to carry the message that perfect wings can be seen while on earth. Peace as you travel for yours. You have charted a path for us all to care and love. - Cyndi Cunningham I had been a Peter, Paul, and Mary fan for several years before I finally got to see them live in concert at the outdoor Carter Baron Amphitheater in Washington, DC. It rained. And while we sat mostly drenched in our seats, Peter came out and said, “If you are willing to sit out there in the rain, we are willing to risk our instruments and sing for you. Peter was famously fastidious about sound and his instruments, but he wasn’t going to let the crowd down. What a show they put on and by the end we were all standing and singing and dancing in the rain. Peter, you changed my life for the better. All love and good wishes to you. ​ - Russ Walsh Dear Peter, I continue to pray for your dragon strength and to send healing thoughts. I last saw you perform at Pier 26 in Manhattan a couple of years ago, and we had a chance to speak briefly afterward. The time before that was in Rockport, and that's when I learned that you had written a joyful conclusion to Puff the Magic Dragon-- Puff was no longer disconsolate, and I was-- and still am-- so glad! Thank you for your decades of music, activism, good humor, and sheer joy! I pray that, especially at this season of joy and hope, that blessings will surround you and your family! ​ - Nancy Wright Dear Dear Peter. I am a 75 year old British person and I have loved your wonderful gift of sensitive musicality and the intensely moving and powerful songs you Mary and Paul brought to us from the early sixties onwards. I also have a deep appreciation of your integrity in standing up for peace and justice through those challenging and turbullent times. You are a true peacemaker and as a Christian I love, honour and respect all that you have stood for so wonderfully and courageously. Offered with my Love and Prayers for you at this time as with your lovely family in support you journey through this illness. Anton Green You have been a part of my life for 60+ years. You remain the bedrock of what I've become and strive to be. Peace onto you. Maybe we'll meet whenever we get there. Hope so. - Al G My first concert without my parents was PP&M at Hampton Beach NH in the mid 60's. That started the lve affair with your music that is still alive today. I don't know how many times I have sung Puff to my two children and their six children. It is the most requested song in my repertoire. I felt like a star struck teenager when I was a bookseller and met you at a School Counselor Conferences in Columbus Ohio. I could barely get out a sentence ti thank you fir all you brought to my life in those tumultuous years. Thank you for your music, your life and your good works. - Jean Haller No song spoke to my anguish facing the draft better than The Great Mandala. No song spoke to my despair over the assassination of Begin and the fading of Israel’s peace movement than Don’t Let the Light Go Out. And no song spoke to my conflicting feelings of hope and despair stirred up in the wake of the Nuclear Freeze campaigns more than Day is Done. - Sandy Pliskin Peter I have watched and heard you for 70 years. I have been a fan of folk music and Peter Paul and Mary for that long. I have seen you and the group many times and loved every minute of your harmonies and songs. I hope you are comfortable and not in too much pain. I love you as a human being and as a very talented musician. Sending healing energy.....Colleen Thank you Peter for your gifts to the world. I grew up with P,P&M as a soundtrack to my childhood. It not only provided me with a rich musical experience but a philosophy of caring, empathy, building community and respect. I then went on to raise my own children and work decades with children to show them the magic of the living world around them, the magic of their own imagination and respect for self, others and nature. Thank you for planting the seed. The ripples of your actions spread wide and caress the world. May you be inundated with love. - Cydney George I grew up watching him, Paul and Mary. It was great . We have an autographed album I received at Westbury music fair when I was in my early 30s. I remember taking my sons on stage to give him flowers. It was awesome to meet him in person. I also have a paper from my mom, that she got from Peter at a school board conference , along with a DVD that has Don’t laugh at me on it. I will remember him forever. All of you have my prayers. - Ilene Meister Peter has been an inspiration and role model for so many artists through his music and activism; my own long music career started in part because of PP&M. He is an icon, a fierce advocate for all that's good and just, and a superb songwriter, singer and musician. His work and music for children shone a light on the path for my own. He has also been the kindest, most generous artist to me personally, inviting me to sing with him in concerts large and small: at PS 6, his children's former school, at the NY Botanical Gardens in the Bronx, at Barnes & Noble, the Cinema Arts Centre on Long Island, and most recently at the Suffolk Theater in Riverhead with him and Melanie the day after my grandson was born. Oh, the memories! Stephen and I love you, Peter. I hope I get to go where you are, to sing with you again someday. Huge hugs. ​ - Patricia Shih Dear Peter, If only a fraction of the love that you have sent our way comes back to you, you'll be forever embraced in its sweetness! Your music and your beautiful presence entered my soul 60 years ago. They fueled my own musicmaking (today, in my senior years, I'm working as a Jewish liturgical musician) then and throughout the years. I hope, in my small corner of the world, to carry on the legacy you've created for as long as I can: the lyrics, the melodies, the peacemaking, the courage! For those of us who have counted you as an inspiration, every note that we play and sing will be carrying it on for you. And may our legacy pass to the generations after us. The last time that I enjoyed one of your live performances was at Landmark on Main Street in Port Washington some years ago. However, during the pandemic, I signed on to your page quite a few times to be there as you mused and sang from your home. It was sweet to spend some time with you in that way, sharing virtual but intimate space, keeping us all connected during such a lonely and frightening time. Thank you for that too. You've given us song and a living example of peace and a model of courage, all such gifts to a world in such desperate need of them. Along with countless thousands (millions?) who love and admire you, I am forever grateful. ​ - Rochelle Potak In 2011, my wife and I attended Peter’s concert in Stoughton, Wisconsin. As we walked into the small lobby, I saw a woman I recognized from 16 years earlier. She was arranging CDs and books on a table. I greeted her and told her of our chance encounter at Newark Airport in 1995, when we were en route to Princeton, NJ, for our son’s wedding. Betty had called my attention to a couple standing about 30 feet away, saying, “Oh, look, that’s Peter Yarrow.” “No,” said I, “it’s just someone who looks like Peter Yarrow because he’s got the same hairline”. But then the man walked away, leaving the woman alone and revealing a large guitar case. So I walked over and asked, “Was that him?” which of course it was. We chatted a bit and I told her Peter and I had attended the same high school. Fast forward now back to the Stoughton Opera House in 2011. At intermission, I purchased a pop-up “Puff the Magic Dragon” book for our about-to-turn-five-year-old granddaughter and lined up to get a signature. The place was jammed and it took a while to get to the desk where Peter was signing and chatting. When I mentioned that he and I were both alums of New York’s High School of Music & Art, the conversation went like this: Peter – Do you remember the school song? Me – Sure. Peter – Good. Let’s sing it now. And we did, receiving a nice round of laughter and applause (more laughter than applause, as I recall). (Here is the song’s lyric, sung to the theme from the Fourth Movement of Brahms’ Symphony No. 1: Now upward in wonder Our distant glance is turning. Where brightly through the ages The immortals’ light is burning. Our task unending, defending That realm above Where dull and lifeless things have caught A beauty that daring dreams have wrought.) Before moving on, I asked Peter, “At Music & Art, what was your instrument?” and he surprised me with, “I was an art student.” He is amazing for both his talent as a musician and as a human being. He brought joy to so many lives and will leave a world better for his having been part of it. A life so well lived. He will be missed. Walt Gray (M&A ’48) Dear Peter, I learned about your song “Don’t Laugh At Me” and your “Operation Respect” from Steve Seskin, a friend of mine, who was kind enough to lend me the song book when I was first teaching. Then I began using your program “Operation Respect” on a class in Richmond, not far from where Steve lives. And I used it to good effect for many years. I can’t thank you enough for that wonderful program!! Additionally, I wrote a paper on your program for my Masters Program in Educational Leadership at Mills College, and it was such a pleasure to share it and write about it. Finally, I wanted you to know that my Junior High School music teacher, gave me my first solo ever singing the first verse of “Puff the Magic Dragon,” which was the beginning of my musical career. Thank you so much for the music and the joy you shared!! Much love as you are always in our hearts Melanie Peter - I crossed paths with you several times. There was the 6 year old me who needed to hear Puff over and over drowning out my parents conversations about Watergate, the RFK assassination and the loss of MLK. Then there was the 17 year old me assisting at RCA Studios in NYC helping to record your song \"Light One Candle\" with a full chorus. You were as \"picky\" about mic placement and the sound of your guitar as I was (and am) - a kindred spirit. Then there were the several times we saw each other at Kerrville, a big hug preceding every conversation. And you always smiled - a real smile - not the kind of smile so many performers put on as they would a shirt or a hat. I remember thinking to myself - does this guy ever have a bad day? I am sorry we haven't seen each other these last several years. Even with stardom you were never a character laying upon the tapestry of folk music. Instead, you are woven into the fabric itself - like Pete and like Woody. And because you are embedded so deeply sometimes your influence and importance is harder to see. But it's there - in every kid who picks up a guitar, in every protester who believes that music matters and can change the course of history. Thank you Peter - for showing us the way. You, more than anyone know that the road will go on long after you have gone, lit by your spirit and the memories of the many miles you have travelled. The world is a much better place because you are in it. ​ - David Seitz I first met you when I was 14, in 1960 at Hampshire Lodge, run by Arnold Fassler. We had a folk music counselor who was not really into people, and he quit after two weeks. Arnold came to me and Peter Siegel, because we were the main folkies at camp, and asked who he should try to hire in the middle of the summer. We had both seen you on a Hootenanny TV show singing \"Buddy Can You Spare a DIme, and we said he should try to find you. And he did--I think you were in Woodstock, NY--and you came to camp and became our beloved folk music counselor! You were so much a people person, and we had a blast for the rest of the summer. You helped us have a big camp hootenanny with lots of kids performing. I particularly remember you teaching us \"Put it on the Ground,\" a humorously extremely sarcastic old Wobbly song (which later became part of the PPM union medley) that we sang with gusto and everyone loved! Peter Siegel even wrote a verse about you, that cracked us all up. I still have the piece of paper that he scribbled it on. It went \"Our folk instruction class was dignified with Billy Faier, clean shaven, neat, and freshly clothed, we always found him there, but things have gotten mighty bad since Peter took the job, he never shaves, or washes up, he's really quite a slob--OH, put it on the ground, spread it all around, dig it with a hoe, and it will make your flowers grow.\" I've thought of you often over the years; we did meet up a few times when I lived in Los Angeles and I came to your concerts, but it's been many many years. I also found out much later that my second cousin (and stepsister) Nina Kelly is your cousin. Her father was your cousin Bill Burt, who was married to Sylvia, who was my father's cousin. My father and Sylvia eventually married, so Nina and I are connected in two ways. You have lived an admirable life and contributed so much to society and to the world. I remember you so well after all these years, and still appreciate the enthusiasm you brought to us at camp, and to your audiences throughout the years. Please know I am thinking of you. Love and hugs, Leslie Dearest Peter! I still call you friend, and feel honored to know you! It's been YEARS since we've spoken, but you've been in my heart all along! We met in Toronto (I think!) many years ago. I covered \"If I Had Wings\" on my album ANGEL AND THE FOLKSINGER. You asked me to drop a copy of the CD off to your hotel room. Months later you sent me a note thanking me for \"...Keeping the tradition of our music alive.\" As an Exec Board member for Local 1000 I saw you a few times at Folk Alliance. One special memory was a benefit concert I organized for AFM Emergency Relief Fund, I THINK it was in Austin. As the sound tech was ringing out the system I was sitting in the audience seating chatting with John McCutcheon, John O'Connor and a few others. You walked in and strode over to where I was sitting, you sat on my lap, facing me, put your hands on either side of my head and planted a kiss on my forehead, \"How ARE YOU my friend?!\" ... I've missed seeing you all these years, but you've always been in my thoughts! Our last performance \"together\" was during COVID when we all added parts to a video for a project Bobby Fisher organized for Immigrants and Refugees for the Franciscans. Bobby sandwiched my part in between the videos you and Noel submitted. GOD BLESS YOU, my Friend! You've been an inspiration for so many! You've brought SO MANY SMILES to so many people! GODSPEED as you journey to that Beautiful Place where we will meet again! Assuming I DO make it there, I will seek you out, walk up to you and PLANT A KISS on your forehead! With all love, respect, and gratitude! Dave Dear Peter, We’ve never met, but you have been part of my life since before I was born! My dad used to play Puff on his guitar for my sisters, and then also for me as the youngest of three. Peter, Paul, and Mary was one of the few bands that everyone in my family could agree on for car rides (on cassette!! Haha) Lemon tree and for lovin me were always two of my other favorites. My very first real concert I ever attended was you, Noel and Mary at NJPAC in 2005. It was beautiful! I’ve seen you at SOPAC and Tarrytown many times since, creating core memories with my husband, mom, and friends. I even chose Puff as my father/mother dance at my wedding! Puff is my safe place, and I wanted my son Walt to have a comforting song to always turn to for himself growing up as well. I’ve attached a few videos Walt learning all about Puff and the picture my sister drew for Walt’s room. Your songs have provided our family with tranquility, hope, and a grateful spirit, and for that, I thank you!!! May Honah Lee be as beautiful as you dreamed. Love, Shari and all of the Yanofski/Degenshein family I grew up listening to my Dad's PP&M records. I was actually born in 1971 at the beginning of the PP&M's \"seven years off for good behavior\". I attended several PP&M concerts over the years and one Peter & Noel concert (2015 I think). I have always had a strong social conscience and a strong sense of justice. However, much of how I think of these issues has been informed by the music of PP&M. Some of my favorites: Blowin in the Wind, Where Have All the Flowers Gone, Some Walls, Deportee, Day Is Done (thank you Peter) and Don't Laugh at Me (again thank you Peter). This last song has recent meaning for me. My daughter (now 18 and a senior in high school) has autism, ADHD, anxiety and epilepsy. She has been bullied in school. We have dealt with school staff who don't believe her. it is so wonderful to be able to listen to Don't Laugh at Me and know that there are people out there who get it. Thank you Peter. I will always treasure your music and your commitment to caring for all people. ​ - Philip Foster Hi, Peter! Nearly twenty years ago, you were visiting Central Washington University in Ellensburg, WA to tell us (we were teaching academic civic engageent) about Operation Respect. With Jan Bowers, we had dinner at a local restaurant, Valley Cafe. A young college student was our server. When she found out who you were (or may have recognized you!), she exclaimed, \"Peter, Paul, and Mary are my mom's favorites!\" You replied, \"Get her on the phone!\" She did, and for ten minutes you chatted with your motherly fan and sang her a song across the wires. What a big compassionate heart you have, Peter. I, and I'm sure the mother and daughter you shared that precious time with, will always carry your thoughtfulness and humor in our hearts. Thank you always, not only this wonderful memory, but also for a lifetime of magic and music and care. Much and always love to you and your family. Peace to All Hearts, Nan Doolittle, Ellensburg, WA. The first LP that I ever purchased was the first PP&M album back in the early 60’s. I’ve always admired the dedication of Peter and the group to the cause of peace and the wellbeing of all people. Peter and his son came to Traverse City Mi a few years ago for a concert that I will never forget. Peter sang the inspirational songs that we all loved. At intermission I requested a song to be sung from his son. He did not know the song, but he said that Peter would. Sure enough, Peter recited, “Wasn’t that a Time” along with a few appropriate observations for us all. Many of us were in tears. I’ll never will forget the experience and message. ​ - Len Klein Peter was attending a FAI conference. We were waiting for an elevator. I was too timid to talk to him but he came over and shook my hand asked my name and how I was doing. He was so nice. My last time was when he was playing Circle of Friends coffeehouse in Franklin MA. He had performed there a few times. Getting the crowd onstage for his Puff song etc. I was selected to pick him up at the Providence train station to take him to the show. I saw him get off the train and introduced myself and we went to my car for the 1/2 hour drive. He had just come back from Israel working on a peace initiative. He was on the phone the whole time, talking to Joan Baez and other people he was working with. I was just in awe of this amazing person sitting in MY car. What a privilege that was. We had tickets to see him in November in Boston and was very sad and concerned when it got canceled. This is very sad news. ​ - Barry Kasindorf I particularly love both “Light One Candle” and “River of Jordan,” and in fact was just this morning moved to sing one verse of “River…” in my unprogrammed Friends Meeting after another Friend spoke of how we, a gathered people, are like the river which flows past our Meetinghouse. But the singing of “River of Jordan” which I shall always remember was many years ago. I was teaching freshman English in Milwaukee’s inner city, almost-all-Black North Division High School when the beloved choir teacher took a year’s sabbatical and I, whose major was choral music, was asked to step in. She had used mostly Gospel music which she played by ear, so the year was a trial by fire for me, but one of our proudest achievements was singing “River of Jordan” for an assembly at another high school, using slides to illustrate the lyrics. I arranged it for SATB a cappella chorus, changing only “We are the Father, we are the Son” to “We began in Africa, ev’ry daughter and son,” and hoping you wouldn’t have minded. Thank you for the beauty and hope you have given to our world. The Light has not gone out, and I hope your presence will remain with us to keep it burning in our hearts. ​ - Kay Augustine Peter with all my love in 2018 when you were at BETHEL WOODS I told you that I was Judy pool stepsister. during the encore you invited me up on stage with my service dog Bailey he was such a ham and we both laughed. You had a really good time. I will never ever forget it. There is two videos that somebody took of you singing, puff, the magic Dragon, and when I was on stage, I watch it all the time such an amazing night and such a great memory. I do watch that video a lot I’ve been thinking of you lately you gave me such a hug. You’re a great hugger. I love your music. I love listening to Peter, Paul & Mary. I was so blessed to have this experience. I don’t know if the photo I downloaded got to you. With loads of love, Laura, Bernard Damone. In April 2009, my family and I happened upon you performing at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books at the UCLA campus. You were playing solo on the \"etc.\" stage. I'd seen you, Mary and Noel Paul perform before in large venues, but this little outdoor stage on a street corner was intimate and inviting. It felt like you were playing to a group of friends in someone's backyard. I loved hearing you play your songs solo, but, not surprisingly, it wasn't long before you'd invited some 15 to 20 children onto the stage to join you in song. To this day, hearing you sing that day remains one of my all-time favorite memories. Thanks so much for your music, your activism for peace and justice, and for your kind and generous heart. Rest well, and know that you are surrounded by love and support from the many lives you have touched through the years. ​ - Randy Miller Peter...May God Bless: I am just a few years younger and have been listening to your music as long as you have been performing. You music has uplifted me in times of sorry and made the good times seem even better. Thank you so much for sharing your talent and music with the world. Be assured that you will continue on to a new and exciting experience and that the music of P P and M will make that experience even better. Throw in a good word with the Big Guy for the rest of us when you get there. Go in peace and God Speed. ​ - John Egenolf All I can say is \"Peter, YOU ARE A GIFT TO HUMANITY\"....I am now 73 yrs. old - have been listening to you since I was a child - have sung your songs on the deathbeds of a few friends (who requested it) - introducing the \"Brits\" to your music in our conferences having them sing along which they don't do easily - We don't have the \"sing a longs\" anymore like we used to with your music as we fought the injustices of the world - celebrated community with your music - and maybe just for that one moment we all felt as \"one\" as we sang the Peter, Paul, and Mary songs that reverberated throughout our universe. My deep thanks for it all. And we will keep singing....March on.....In friendship, care and peace, Pat Beeman Peter, although we never met face to face in the flesh, I was blessed to meet you and get to work with you virtually on our Share the Journey virtual concert for immigrants and refugees in 2020. It was a privilege to work with both you and Noel on this project. Thank you for your generosity and for the way you've touched my life and the lives of so many others with your music and your life's work. Here is a video of This Land is Your Land, the finale song of the concert. It includes shots of you and Noel singing side by side. Donna Peña is also in the video. She was part of a pilgrimage with you years ago to El Salvador with the Center for Global Education. Much love and blessings, Bobby Fisher https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBfhND_hfpw&list=RDnBfhND_hfpw&start_radio=1 Dear Bethany and Christopher, I wanted to share my deepest gratitude for your father, Peter, whose kindness, wisdom, and unwavering support have touched my life profoundly. To Peter: Peter, our unexpected connection during the challenges of COVID-19 was a gift I will always cherish. From the first moment we spoke about your Keep On Keepin' On show, a friendship blossomed that I never anticipated. You offered me guidance and professional support when I needed it the most. Your presence and advice helped me navigate personal challenges, and your wisdom gave me the strength to persevere. As a lifelong Peter, Paul, and Mary fan, connecting with you felt like a dream come true. Your music, particularly Puff the Magic Dragon, has been a part of my life since childhood, thanks to my father’s love for folk music. To have you share that music with me and offer me the gift of your time, music, and mentorship has been beyond words. While we never got the opportunity to meet in person, our Zoom sessions, where we shared music and stories, are memories I will forever treasure. I’ll never forget the thoughtful gifts you sent my daughter, Kaavya—especially the illustrated Puff the Magic Dragon storybook and your folk songbooks. Your caricature and personal notes on the books and CDs, along with your signature, have been cherished gifts that have introduced Kaavya to the world of folk music and become a part of her bedtime routine. Thank you, Peter, for being my wise old dragon, mentor, and friend. Your music, wisdom, and the love you shared with me will live on in my heart forever. The time we spent together has enriched my life in ways I’ll always hold dear. With heartfelt gratitude, Sameer Our children who are 45 and 47 years old now know most of the songs that Peter, Paul and Mary recorded. That would be because my husband and I loved the heart that was far more than just words. The girls, now women, are sharing the music with their children as well. Our oldest daughter chose Puff the Magic Dragon for her father daughter dance at her wedding. My beloved husband played the guitar for years and this Dragon Puff. Carl, my husband passed over on August 31, 2024. At his memorial service the cards handed out were beautiful and serene watercolor of a forest with a steam. The first verse of Puff the Magic Dragon was printed in the watercolor scene. It has been heartbreaking to know what your father has lived through. My Carl had four cancers over thirty two years and was so strong up to his last breath. May Carl and Peter meet each other on the other side and si g and play together! ​ - Ann Bach One of my fondest memories is when I got to hug Peter on the stage of the Mt Baker Theatre in Bellingham, Washington back in 1998. My wife, daughter and I were sitting in the second-to-last row of the upper balcony, totally enjoying the Peter, Paul, and Mary concert. After the first set, Peter came on to perform a few solo songs. As he began the second verse of a completely unfamiliar song, he forgot one of the words and stopped the song while trying to remember the lyric. He continued to wait and ponder and struggle to remember. Meanwhile I, one of over 1200 people sitting uncomfortably and silently in the audience, whispered my guess at the alliterative word he was trying to find. After several minutes and with my wife’s encouragement, I called out to Peter the word “frontiers” from the top of the upper balcony and he responded by looking up and saying “Thank you, Doctor”. After resuming and completing the song, Peter invited the mystery “doctor” to meet him back stage after the concert, which I did and there found him to be the warmest, most genuine person that one might meet. I have always cherished this memory and have very much enjoyed sharing it now and especially for this gentle soul whose music has meant so much to me and my family for so many years. ​ - Rollin Harper Dear Peter, I learned that you were so very ill a couple of days ago when listening to the folk music program on Little Steven's Underground Garage. After speaking of your illness, the host played a live solo version of Puff The Magic Dragon that you performed in what appeared to be a children's show. The enthusiasm of the kids was moving and your voice, as always, wonderful; I was moved to tears by it all. Notwithstanding the solo performance and the knowledge that you each had separate lives, you are inextricably tied to Paul and Mary in the minds of your fans. I had the opportunity to attend many P P & M concerts (mostly at Kleinhan's Music Hall in Buffalo) over the years and loved each one. But what makes you all the more special is your appearances at countless civil rights, anti-war, and human rights demonstrations and events over the years. Your dedication to peace and justice was, and remains an inspiration and is greatly appreciated. I am sure you will be missed by your family and friends, but you will live on through your music in the hearts and minds of millions of people for many generations to come. So, I end this by simply saying Thank You. Sincerely, Len Klaif, Ojai CA I grew up in the 1980’s and 1990’s listening to Peter, Paul, and Mary on the radio, learning all the words to several of their songs. Many times they’ve helped me through life’s moments, like going away from home on an airplane, or when I need to keep going with the right thing to do even if it’s hard. I loved listening to Puff the Magic Dragon as a kid and still sing it to my own kids now. I had the pleasure of meeting Peter in 2009-ish during an Environmental Education Conference (NAAEE). Joe Baust was my boss and mentor and he put me in charge of calling and waking Peter up from a nap (after a long day of traveling). I was thrilled to have the opportunity to escort him around the conference. He was so sweet and generous with his time. I will always tell friends about the time I got to meet him! Thanks, Peter, for always being kind and generous to other people. Time is valuable and you paid it forward to the next generations. Thank you Peter!!! ​ - Lindsey Mothersbaugh Hello Peter, I wouldn't expect you to remember this, but I met you personally here in Ojai, CA, my home for the past 30+ years. It must have been in the early 90s. I was crossing the courtyard toward Matilija Street when I saw you. I stared in disbelief. Could this be the guy whose music with Peter, Paul & Mary I've loved so much since childhood? I asked timidly as you approached, \"Are you Peter Yarrow?\" You answered proudly, \"I am!\" and shook my hand. I was overwhelmed as one would be to meet someone on the street who has been such an icon in my life. I hardly knew what to say. We mentioned John Court who was living here in Ojai at the time, the guy who wrote the blurb on the back of Album 1700, my favorite P, P & M album. You were quite excited when I mentioned him. I believe your words were something on the order of \"He lives here? No shit?\" Yes, no shit. It was an exciting moment for me that I'll never forget. You've been quite an inspiration for me, especially in my younger years when I used to sing and play P, P & M songs on my guitar. Yours were among the first songs I learned to play, including, of course, the iconic \"Puff the Magic Dragon.\" But I've loved nearly all your songs, whether they were composed by you, Noel Paul Stookey, Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Gordon Lightfoot, John Denver, etc. Your inspiration will always be with me, as well as millions of others I'm sure. God bless you. \"If I had wings, no one would ask me should I fly...\" ​ - George Miller My 56 year career curently in the Australian Record Industry, would never have started without those amazing songs hitting our home radio speakers back in 1962, \"Puff\" being just one, I am totally indebited to Peter, for steering my life in a musical direction so many years ago, I attended every PP&M concert in Sydney, the first being 1963 when I was 14 yrs old, at the old Sydney Stadium, since then my assotation with all 3 of the trio has been imesarable, I last saw Peter in LA in 2018, and fondly remember the Trios 1986 25th Anniversary concert which i recorded just for the trio, and sat with Peter at the Sydney Opera House while he tuned his guitars, Peter I have and will always love you, along with Noel, and Mary of course, you have been the pivot in my life that changed me to be a better person. \"If I Had Wings, No one would ask me can I fly\" Peace & Love - Warren Dear Peter. To help with a little context, I am a very close personal friend of Warren Barnett who informed me today that you are a little weary and unwell just now. I have been a folk singer (including groups with Warren) and music collector for many years and whilst in my mind Woody and Pete always lead the charge, for me, it has always been you at the centre of my music and social attitudes. Whether you are singing, speaking or making representations for the causes close to your heart, your unwavered care, commitment and truth has so often lifted me up and moved me forward. We met in 1986 backstage at the Lyric Theatre in Sydney with my wife Leanne and daughter Rebecca and you signed (one of my copies) of the 'You Are What You Eat' CD .. such a special memory. I have sung and performed so many of your wonderful songs over the years. I love them all (even The Colonoscopy Song) .. My favourite Peter Yarrow song? .. darn hard call but I have always had a soft spot for 'Rich Man, Poor Man'. Leanne and I were able to go in to the Bitter End and have some photos at 'that wall' in 2009 too. Just the owner and us (just fortunate timing) .. another special PPM moment for me. I have the footage of PPM performing on the steps of the unfinished Sydney Opera House in 1970 too ... another favourite. I have not missed a PPM concert in the Sydney area (including Bowral) since 1982. So thank you Peter. Thank you for so much of you that truly shaped much of my life. May God bless you ... Joe :) I was inspired to write a sequel to Puff that indicates that Puff lives on in future generations, just as Peter's music will continue to live on and inspire future generations. The following words to the exact same melody as the original: Little Johnny paper, loved his papa Jack Who always gave him candy and ride upon his back Johnny loved to take walks along the cherry lane And run along the seashore and play out in the rain One grey day young Johnny stumbled on a cave He looked into the darkened hole and decided to be brave The cave was strewn with green scales wax and strings and stuff He stumbled on into the dark along the cave walls rough He fell back in terror when he saw those glowing eyes The dragon seemed to know him much to his surprise It quickly was apparent there was no need to fear As he watched a mighty torrent of joyful dragon tears Puff the magic dragon still lives by the sea and folicks in the mist again in a land called hanna-lee Puff the magic dragon still lives by the sea and folicks in the mist again in a land called hanna-lee Dragons live forever, often all alone Boys grow up and marry, have children of their own The innocence of childhood is not lost but it's saved It's passed down in our children's minds and found in magic caves Puff the magic dragon still lives by the sea and folicks in the mist again in a land called hanna-lee Puff the magic dragon still lives by the sea and folicks in the mist again in a land called hanna-lee ​ - Jim Herrmann Though we have never really met in person, other than the generous post-concert time you always took with fans, you, and the group were pretty much the sound track of our lives for three generations, reaching back to an early concert at the Flint, Michigan IMA auditoriam and so many venues and events since. That continued with our children, now approaching 30 who heard all of your wonderful music and thoughts throughout their formative years. The last time we saw PP&M together was in a Synagog in Southfield, Michigan, shorlty after Mary found a donor and temporary remission from Leukemia. I am not what one would call a spiritual person, preferring to believe what I can see and experience directly so this is about the only thing I know for sure about the afterlife. I'm certain that the love we pour onto others and into the world is a permanent element that stays out there in the ether that surrounds us. I feel that every day from those who have passed on, whether parents, family members, Martin Luther King or the carpenter who built my house. By that definition, dear Peter, you will be with us, uplifting us in huge measure, every day now and forever. Thanks for all the love you poured into the world. Its not going anywhere and your sweet survivors will carry on because of it. ​ - Larry Lobert I had the immense honour of helping out friends who ran a folk festival in central MA for years. They asked if I would be interested in picking up Peter at North Station in Boston and driving him to the Hanover Theatre in Worcester for a performance. What??? Would I??? Oh my God, yes!! I met him after he got off a train from somewhere up north and he was by himself, pulling a suitcase and of course carrying a guitar case. He was a bit under the weather with a cold. He stopped for a slice of pizza before we got in the car and he took the opportunity during the drive to answer emails and make a couple calls. I had a thousand questions for him but \"read the room\" and sensed he preferred some peace, probably thinking about his voice for the performance that night and not feeling great. I wasn't able to stay for the performance, but before we said goodbye, he make sure to take a photo with me which I have hanging on the wall and will forever cherish. I wish Peter as many peaceful and painless moments until his hour is reached, and I thank him for making such an important impact on music and the world. Peace and love, Peter. ​ - Bill Engvall Dearest Peter, I want to thank you for your big, big heart! I just got back from Kauai, where we spent a lovely afternoon in Hanalei, which of course is where Puff the Magic Dragon lives. He lives forever in the gorgeous mountains that with a dragon shape encircle the bay, and create the mist, with a wonderful dragon-like impact. Peter, you will live on forever, in the hearts of all of us who were raised on that song, and cried everytime we sang it, and smiled everytime we sang others of your songs! You will live on in the impact of the social justice work you do, the causes you have supported and promoted. But mostly you will live on in our hearts as a very special man. Mahalo! Warmest blessings and much love to you from Berkeley, CA. ​ - Arlene Baxter I’ve spent my whole life loving and singing the music of Peter,Paul and Mary. They are a part of my soul. My mom was a choir director and growing up in the 60s their songs were always part of our folk choir repertoire. I remember finally getting to see them in concert in my late 20s. It was late 1988 and we had gotten a babysitter for my 2 month old daughter. I was so excited to be going I told the baby sitter I was going to see Peter Paul and Mary. I got met with a stare and a “who”. At 26 I felt ancient. I continued to follow their careers and loved discovering Paul’s solo albums. Especially the stories of the hen house. When Peter’s Puff the Magic Dragon and Day is Done books came out he was at a bookstore in Denver for a book signing. I took my youngest daughter with me and Peter was so gracious. He spent time talking with us and spent some extra time talking to my daughter Kelly and signing our books. They hold a treasured place of honor in our house. I could not imagine a world without the music of Peter Paul and Mary. Thank you Peter for sharing your gift with the rest of us. I feel honored. ​ - Karen Woodward Peter Yarrow. I loved your folk songs for many years but it was only when I attended college in Buffalo, Ny ( 1966-69) that I really saw you as the person that you are. After your concert with Paul and Mary at Kleinhans Music Hall in Buffalo, the 3 of you invited anyone at the concert to meet you outside to talk about the current events of the day and I chose you! Outside on a cool crisp evening a group of us had discussion and comraderie with you and that was a turning point in my life. Your words, your wisdom touched me to my core as your insight into the world and humanity opened my eyes. I wanted to touch people in the ways you have; through music and compassionate understanding. We discussed the Vietnam war at great length and I was so utterly touched by your vision that I set out on a path to teach others to have love for their fellow man where we could all live together in harmony. I also am musical so I tried to teach children with music in a library setting. I feel proud that I tried hard to follow your example and did so until my retirement. I am now 76 and a half years old and to my dismay I find our country has turned away from all the values and understanding we had in the 1960’s. I am dismayed and saddened about the state of our fellow Americans these past 10 years, BUT…… I will never give up. My life is such that I will continue to spread love and understanding to others and with that…. Continue your wonderful legacy. Please know how you gave and continue to give so much joy and understanding to the world through your values and music. I love you Peter…. And Paul and the never to be forgotten Mary. Peter, Paul and Mary will live on in our hearts and our children’s and grandchildren’s hearts eternally. Peace and love to you. With sincere gratitude, Ruthie( a flower child from the 60’s) Peter, You have been like a companion to me even decades before we met, as your songs have been soundtrack of my life since I was pre-teen. Now, in my retirement I look back at the highlights of my years as a rabbi and Jewish leader, and you are right up there as what I can only call \"my life highlight.\" When you and I first spoke about your coming to my synagogue -- Ohavi Zedek Synagogue in Burlington, VT--I was awestruck by your kindness, warmth and tremendous generosity. At that moment I learned to admire you not only for the inspiring and uplifting songs I have been singing my whole life, thanks to you, but there was more--as I felt so very blessed to have had a chance to get to know you a bit in our time together, planning for the event and when you came to Burlington. Your gift of song, with imagination, beauty, friendship and uplifting values remains a brilliant light in my life and my family's life, and indeed our world. When you came to my home and spontaneously sang a unique, joyous, happy birthday song to my son Judah, you brought light to our home and our family that remains with us as a gift. We were all touched by the love you shared with us. We are so grateful for the blessing of that time with you. When you sang for our community that night, everyone felt the gift of your spirit--a bright light -- and we will not let the light go out. You are forever in our hearts. Rabbi Amy Small I've been listening to Peter, Paul, and Mary ever since I was 7 years old (I'm 67 now) My uncle gave me the LP for Christmas, it was the first 33 that I ever played on my phonograph (over and over and over!) and I still know the words to every song by heart. The lyrics made an impact on my life and honestly helped to shape who I am today. My favorite song on the record was 'If I Had A Hammer' even though I loved singing them all. Thank You for giving us so many gifts, and songs, the Christmas Specials on PBS are magical memories. I was able to bring both of my daughters when they were still in grade school to hear you, Mary and Noel play at the Blue Hill Fairgrounds in Maine. We sat on the grass right in front of the stage. ( I was a friend of the Hen House and WERU) Their favorite song was 'Puff', so they too were blessed to sing along with you. Sending Peace & Many Blessings to You Dear Peter...I will be keeping you in my prayers and carrying you in my heart. ​ - Donna Hurley With reverence for both his passion and perfectionism I post my memories of Peter during pre show sound checks: 1- At a Central Park Concert where he mi mi mi-ed, and ah ah ah-ed for at least a half hour. 2- Fast forward to a show I did called “In Celebration Of St Patrick” with Pete Seeger, Richard Harris, Paul Sorbino and of course Peter among others. I predicted Peter’s detailed rehearsal encounter with the patient sound man. As my check followed Peter’s “with a what do I need to do for you” from the engineer; I said if it's too loud lower it, too low higher it. He seemed relieved! The following is a Sequel to Puff written by Bernard Levine. I hope Peter sees it and approves: Puff was sad and lonely His friend had gone away He’d look along the Cherry Lane And mourn another day He’d think about the good times And how they used to play Then he’d think about the night That Jackie went away Puff thought he was dreaming He saw Jackie and a boy He ran up and hugged Jacks neck It filled his heart with joy The dragon’s mind was flooded With thoughts of bygone fun Petting Puff’s enormous head Said Puff here is my son Together you can travel On a boat with billowed sails My son can keep a lookout Perched on your gigantic sail I must go away now I’m all grown up you see But you and Jackie Junior Can play in Homah Lee.oh.. ​ - Bob Horan I have been a lifelong fan. I first saw Peter with Paul and Mary at an anti-war concert in the 60's. I was so excited when he appeared in Pittsburgh for Calliope. Especially as I am the house photographer! I have had the pleasure of photographing many wonderful musicians over the last 30 years, but never before was I tongue tied when meeting them! I consider Peter to be one of the greatest forces for good of the 20th century. His kindness, courage, and good humor show us the way to a better world! He was so gracious and showed me through the new pop-up version of Puff, showing me the little changes from the original, and gave me a copy. I will always treasure it! There are so many things I wish I had said to him that night, but I was so overwhelmed being in his presence that I couldn't find my voice! I have tears running down my face realizing that I will not have the opportunity again in this life. Very few people have given such joy and hope to the world. (We need him so, right now!) I don't know what awaits us after this life, but I do know that if something wonderful is available, that is where Peter will be! God bless you, Peter, and thank you! ​ - Roddy Mcwha My parents were lifelong fans of Peter, Paul & Mary, and shared similar philosophical beliefs in social justice. My 4 sisters and I were raised in a household that was based in family, faith and a belief in equality. My dad passed away 14 years ago from Multiple Myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells. My mother, now 91, is confined to a wheelchair and has full-blown Alzheimer’s disease. I visit her a few times weekly, and music continues to be the pathway into the depths of a mind that is now closed to most other methods. And without fail, when I play the music of Peter, Paul, & Mary, she sings along without hesitation, when conversation is no longer possible. Her absolute favorite is Puff, which I have asked my sisters to be played as her final piece of music at her eventual funeral. Your music and legacy continues to “speak on”, even when all else fails. Know that your gifts continue to provide everlasting peace and comfort may the grace of your magic provide you the same. Bless you! ​ - Betsy Parker Dear Peter, I was a guest performer at Carnegie one Thanksgiving show with Arlo Guthrie. The next day, Arlo, his family , me and my daughter Emmalee went to The Bottom Line for fundraiser for Dave Van Ronk. Arlo , daughter Sarah Lee, Tom Paxton and Peter Paul and Mary were preforming among others. I was hanging out with Peter, Paul and Mary before the show began , all of us babbling about music, the show, etc. Mary asked me where I was from, responding to some comment about me having played Carnegie with Arlo the night before. I had a picture of The Tiller School in Beaufort , NC which I wanted to show them. It was in my purse, which was on the floor. For For some reason, my purse was too heavy to lift... I couldn't figure out why. Peter burst out laughing and suggested that I remove my foot from the purse... .... I had been standing on it. I just remember how wonderful it was to share laughter with Peter that night, ~ a laughter that remains fresh and fun today as it was that night at The Bottom Line. As the show was beginning, Peter looked at me and told me to give his love to the Tiller School children.... which I did when I returned to NC. Such a sweet, dear forever memory of a magical night in NYC at The Bottom Line with Peter Paul, Mary, Arlo, etc. Thank you for the laughter, Peter. I will live on in my heart always. And the children say thank you for the love you sent to them~ they are forever touched by your music and kindness. Love, Kitty West The children of The Tiller School, Beaufort, NC My own children, Norah, Joseph and Emmalee And all the children of the world. Forever and always, we love you. Dear Peter, I hope these words find you in a peaceful and comfortable moment. I was born in the early sixties and can't remember the first time I heard your music. It was always there in elementary school. I knew the lyrics long before I understood them but somehow elementary school was the perfect place to have your music. In high school most of us were too cool or insecure to sing about Puff. After a first career in the Navy I returned home and followed some friends' suggestion to pick up the guitar and become a teacher. In the photo is a selection of Puff slides showing how I highlighted high frequency words in your lyrics to help teach reading. After over 30 years of teaching mostly kindergarten I have just retired. I taught and sang many of your songs and was often told how I touched so many hearts. But truly it was your songs through me that did it. Especially Puff! I was just channeling the authentic love I felt as I listened and sang along to your PBS specials. Your love lives on through your songs. Even now I return every week to lead the sing along. I was fortunate enough to have met you at the Garamendi Ranch in 2016. Your music continues to find new generations of appreciative listeners. I thank you for your continuing contributions to the hungry hearts of the world. With great appreciation, Michael Bonomo Not only did I enjoy your music for many years, I used your program \"Don't Laugh At Me\" while teaching students with special needs. It was such a blessing as your music has been timeless. One of the 1st songs I learned to play on the guitar as a child myself was \"Puff\". I believe that on the other side of this flesh, our earthly selves, is a beautiful place in heaven. Dancing with Jesus to \"Puff\", seems wonderful to me. Well done good and faithful servant Peter! God has you in the palm of HIS hands. ​ - Joy Butler Dear Peter, I’ve never met you, nor seen you in person, but as an wonderful comrade of Peter, Paul and Mary, you have been a major part of my life and have me wanting to thank you. I am just an ordinary 68 year old woman who was lucky enough to have my elders, including siblings, introduce me to your music. There are some songs, many of them in fact, that I’ll never forget. These songs were the first that I learned to play ukulele with and eventually guitar. But most important, just your presence on stage showed and still shows tribute to a simpler, kinder and loving world that I was innocent enough to enjoy. My children even grew up with your songs and I often played videos of your group together. I applaud the determination and success you have made in your personal endeavors as well as the character you stand behind. I will always remember you as an asset to my life and to the life of others. Thank you! Heaven waits for you, another artist, like so many to go before, and you can join in the glorious music they enjoy there. God Bless. ​ - Mark Kramer Dear Peter, Do dreams come true? Yes, even if one has yet to consciously experience them. And I’ve had my share. Blessings for a lifetime. And there are dents in life that aren’t really impressions and there are impressions that aren’t really dents. Each has its meaning. Each its lasting impact. And you and I have shared both. It was June 1979 when I arrived in my ’77 Porsche at the Continental Hyatt House (aka the Riot House) on Sunset Boulevard, having responded to your request for a ride to that day’s Survival Sunday/NO Nukes concert at the Hollywood Bowl. Out you came, guitar case in hand whereupon you inadvertently dented the driver’s side quarter panel. I winced as we headed to the soundcheck. Not exactly a welcome impression but certainly a dent. But within a few miles the sting of the dent dissolved making way for the lifelong impression. Noel and Mary were there. As were Joan Baez, Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Melissa Manchester, Lily Tomlin, Robin Williams, John Denver, Sweet Honey in the Rock, Holly Near and the ever brave beacons Dr. Helen Caldecott and Ralph Nader. That wasn’t our first hangout nor would it be our last. In 1963 I’d just finished school where politics were everywhere. I joined sit-its, marches and was committed to social justice. The folk movement inspired my generation to step-up. To act-up. That Fall I met PP&M and Noel’s girlfriend Betty Bannard backstage at George Washington University's Lisner Auditorium. I was booking college concerts in Washington, Maryland and Virginia. And by coincidence Betty and I recognized each other as former Jr. High School classmates in Westfield, NJ and have revisited that arc of history for 6+ decades. There were other concerts, college and otherwise before I moved west to be Tom and Dick Smothers’ road manager. But you and I saw each off the music world grid. Mary Beth and you invited Brenda and me to your Broad Beach/Malibu, oceanside home where little Yarrows and little Fritzes “frolicked” while some adult guests did what some 60’s adults were oft inclined to do. And we welcomed you to our dinner table as well Years passed, there were coincidental meetings on airport concourses or a random folk festival. Tom and Dick’s Comedy Hour was a CBS hit (until it wasn’t). As the co-executive producer I was thrilled to book the Trio for what was a moving appearance. As more decades landed in our rearview mirrors you, Flora and I met for dinners at Cafe Luxembourg, walked through NY museums and evenings at your home near Central Park. It was a rare trip to the East coast that we didn’t see each other. Penny welcomed me, offered snacks as you and I caught up with kid-talk and the world in general. More years passed. The Trio’s career undulated. And so did mine. You three went separate ways. Solo albums. Solo bookings. I too experienced changes. Clients came and went. The trio coalesced under a couple of new manager firms. Didn’t work. Then that 80’s call . You asked, “Would you consider becoming our manager?” And I asked, “What took you so long?” Thus began nearly 20 years of unimaginable personal and professional growth. The Trio test and trusted me and I trusted them. We broke new ground while revisiting long ago adventures. Multiple PBS specials, returning to Warner Brothers Records, US and international touring and a sense of rebirth that further strengthened the bedrock of a long revered career. You, Noel, Mary and I stood vigil with Bishop Tutu at the South African Embassy and met with Nelson Mandela as the Trio’s ethos continued. You sang at Jenny’s Bat Mitzvah, you three sang at an ALS fundraiser in memory of my Dad. Brenda and I were thrilled to sit in at a tiny East LA club to witness an early performance by proud Peter and emerging singer Bethany. More impressions. Nary a dent. Oh Peter, the cascading memories, the dents and the impressions, everyone a patch in our shared lifetime quilt. They’ve been life altering experiences. So many impressions and so few dents, everyone left a mark. So thank you for decades of shared memories. Long may Puff’s Daddy bring joy to all on his radar and to those on yours. Love from SoCal, Ken... Dearest Peter, You have graced our lives with so many joyous memories. You were so kind and loving to our son Dylan. On many occasions, you brought him up on stage to sing with you the infamous song, Puff the Magic Dragon. On another special occasion, we were able to attend a concert with you, Paul and Mary. You told an admirable story of the fluctuating feelings of the ebb and flow of life. You began with a young fan who had passed away and then you segued into mentioning the beginning of a new life, our three week old son Dylan. I lifted Dylan up in the air, the crowd went wild and “roared“ with delight and cheers! It was an extraordinary moment and a delightful evening. On a visit to Seattle, you came to our home for dinner. After a wonderful meal and great conversation, you brought out your guitar and proceeded to sing, The Wedding Song. Dylan was about 11 months old. He crawled off the couch, went into his playroom and brought out his bongo-drums and proceeded to play with you. A giggle-worthy moment to say the least. One concert that was extremely special to me was, I attended one of your concerts that just happened to fall on my Birthday. Then to my surprise, the entire audience sang Happy Birthday to me! For a girl who loves her Birthday, more than you will ever know… It was a fabulous evening to say the least! Lastly, Thank you for all the days you have made brighter just by being you. There are more of them the we can count. Thinking of the extraordinary life you have lived, the great times we have shared, we are feeling so grateful for you! We love you so, Petter Yarrow ~ Sent with more love then your heart can hold, Janet, Jeff and Dylan Hoch We've never been formally introduced, but I have spoken with you at Kerrville Folk Festival more than once. My brother and I had sung your songs for many years, trying to copy harmonies of the 3 of y'all. Asoaling was one of our favorites, as well as the marvelous toy. You signed a book of mine of the Marvelous Toy about 2001 when you and Paul and Mary came to Kerrville. (I do know Tom Paxton wrote the song, although we cherished your version of it). While my brother is no longer with us, Thank you for all the music that meant so much to us thru the years!! And for being such a force at the KFF!! We love you...My children grew up listening to your music and I truly hope they pass it on!! ​ - Sarah Mckeever I have three memories related to Peter Yarrow I'd like to share When Puff the Magic Dragon came out, I remember listening to it on the radio with my dad in our back yard. Years later as I started playing guitar myself it was an easy song to learn and everyone loved hearing it. I have sung that song with my kids and grandkids. Years later when Peter was touring after the release of his album Peter, one of my all-time favorite albums, I was able to see him live. He was so connected to the audience and so enjoying the music that they literally had to drag him and his two bandmates off the stage. But the memory that I think most personifies Peter to me occurred a few years ago when I was part of a team organizing a benefit concert called Share the Journey which supported organizations working with immigrants and refugee. As we were planning the annual event, COVID struck, and we had to shift to a virtual concert. I don't remember who knew who and how Peter was contacted but he graciously submitted a video of one of his songs for the event we were streaming and also agreed to be part of a video collage of This Land is Your Land, which we used as the finale. That was at least 4 years ago and not only do people tell me how wonderful the video was but that they at times pull it up on YouTube to give them a boost. My young granddaughter was so excited when she learned that the man singing in the video was the man who wrote Puff. Here is the link to that video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBfhND_hfpw In closing, Peter has been an inspiration and a role model to so many musicians and individuals who not only yearn for justice but try to bring it about. My experience is just one example of how his music has created joyful moments in families, groups and communities around the world. I am forever grateful that he has done his part to make this world a better place and pray that he is blessed with peace and serenity at this precious moment in his life. Shalom Peter! ​ - Stephan Young Dear Peter, Your music has been the soundtrack of my life. I grew up in the 60s, and your music influenced and put into words so much of what I was thinking and feeling. I have continued listening to you throughout my adult life, and yes, I have all the old (actual) albums, which are warped and scratched, but I do not have the heart to get rid of them. As we had kids and they grew, we introduced them to you as well, and constantly listened to you especially on those long car trips when they could sing along or the music was a calming influence. We took them to see you whenever you were playing nearby, and even took my parents along as well. And now our grandchildren know you as their camp songs (and songs that Grandma and Poppy like). You have influenced at least three generations of our family, and moved our hearts and souls. Your music will stay with us forever, and the rightness and goodness of the words will always inform how we see the world. It is my hope that you and your music will always be held up as an example of the impact that song can have in this dark and difficult world. With all my heart, I want to thank you and wish you no more pain or sorrow. From the bottom of my heart, I send you love. ​ - Jackie Binstock As a child, I listened to Peter, Paul and Mary on my little record player, singing along to all of the songs. I even wrote my name on cover of the album SEE WHAT TOMORROW BRINGS to say Peter, Paul and Mary + Matt. I’m sure I wasn’t the only kid who did that. Then I was lucky enough to sing along with my heroes at one of the recording sessions for the album PETER, PAUL AND MOMMY. There I am in my tennis sweater, with my mother Patience Fish Tekulsky seated to my right and wearing glasses, in a detail from the photograph on the back cover of the album. I went on to devote much of my professional life to writing about and photographing birds, as well as butterflies, and contributing to preserving nature, no doubt influenced by my parents and PPM. In social areas, I had my first novel published in 2018, entitled THE MARTIN LUTHER KING MITZVAH, all about bringing religions and races together in harmony, again, influenced I’m sure by PPM. We were lucky to be alive when PPM made the great music of our lives. ​ - Mathew Tekulsky Dear Peter, I only met you two years ago after Mary Beth brought you to a screening of The Invisible Extinction at IFC, but it feels like much longer because of the many hours I spent as a child enthralled by In The Wind, the first album I ever owned. I was 10 years old. It introduced me to traditional folk music, Dylan’s genius, and the beauty of three-part harmony. I wore out that record on my parents turntable! So, I knew your voice and your career with Peter, Paul & Mary, but had no idea about you as a person. After the screening we all went to an old Italian restaurant you like on Bleecker Street and as you devoured a plate of pasta, you peppered me with questions about the film, my childhood, and education. And you told me about growing up Jewish in NYC, something we shared. I was touched by your warmth and your curiosity. I felt like I had met an older brother. A couple of months later you asked me to help you with a video you were making to protest the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The video was anchored by and performance you did with Ukrainian singer Maria Burmaka of “Where Have All the Flowers Gone,” and the Ukrainian roots of the song. I was honored and didn’t hesitate, though I’m not sure my advice helped. What struck me was your extraordinary courtesy, calling me brother and sincerely thanking me for my time. I’m pointing this out because that kind of graciousness is not only something wonderful but is rare in the world of musical celebrities – something I know about from years making films in that world. This past January my wife, Helen, and I organized a gathering of friends to see a concert by composer Hahn Rowe at Columbia University. You came with Mary Beth and got to meet scientists Gloria Dominguez-Bello and Marty Blaser from my film. As a talented folk singer and cuatro player who loved PP&M, Gloria was especially delighted to meet you. It was a cold, blustery night and after the concert you scampered down upper Broadway to get a taxi home with Mary Beth, your head swathed in a cap with ear flaps tied under your chin that made you look like Snoopy. The last time I saw you was briefly after the very moving PP&M tribute at the Met Museum this past May. I loved what you said about the timeless appeal of folk music and how it is people’s music, a product of life, not a product to sell. All of us in the audience were with you and Paul from the start, time tripping back to our youths. When we were all singing along to Puff and Leaving on a Jet Plane, I looked around and saw smiles on almost everyone’s face and many with tears in their eyes. In those moments I hope you understood how much you had given to others through your art and activism. During the show and at the after party I took some photos with my phone. I sent them to you but wanted to share two again I especially like – you and Paul holding hands on stage and you at the after party with Judy Collins, another brilliant artist who touched me in my youth. I don’t think I can attach the photos to this document so will see if I can upload them separately. Peter, I’ve treasured the opportunity to know you a bit and only wish it hadn’t taken 60 years to meet after I first heard you! The world needs more artist/activists like you. Thank you, brother. Sending love and a hug to a great mensch. With a song in my heart, Steve Thank you, Peter, for being there for me all of my life. You and Noel and Mary were the joyful and hopeful soundtrack to my childhood. Then later in my young adulthood as I learned to play guitar, yours were the first songs I wanted to learn to play. When my mother was fading into dementia and eventually hospice, she loved Peter, Paul, and Mary songs the best. As our country weathered (and continues to weather) divisive political climates, your songs - especially ones like \"Sweet Survivor,\" \"Light One Candle,\" and \"Don't Laugh at Me\" - keep me going and make me stay hopeful. In \"Don't Laugh at Me,\" your coda incorporating \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\" breaks my heart every time I listen to it. During the early 2000s, your songs and activism inspired me and lifted me from despair. I am fortunate to have seen you perform in person - both with PPM and with Noel - several times, times I will never forget. You have earned your rest but I will miss you and the light you have brought to the world. ​ - Virginia Smith I was honored to be present twice when Peter performed at Caffe Lena in Saratoga Springs. The first time, I was charmed when he came out to us, many people in the anteroom outside the performance room, who had been waiting while Peter was interviewed by WMHT (PBS in the NY Capital District) on video. As we all waited for the TV crew to pack up and leave via the elevator, Peter led us in singing, there in the anteroom and down the open staircase, in singing \"If I Had a Hammer\" and the acoustics in that staircase area were WONDERFUL! And Peter's performance was pure Peter. He got us all singing, songs old and new, and his stories were evocative and focused on the joy of life, and the love of all God's people and justice and peace. I also enjoyed Bethany at Old Songs Festival in Altamont. Thank you so much, Peter, Christopher, and Bethany, for sharing yourselves and your love, faith, and music with all of us! ​ - Lois Ann Wolff I had the pleasure of meeting Peter twice: once after a PPM gig at the Westbury Music Fair where he and Mary autographed my copy of \"No Easy Walk To Freedom\", and once at the Doylestown Bookstore where I got to give him some origami stars and a box that my wife had made. He said that they were beautiful, which made my wife's day. Anyone who has heard his music, with or without P & M, cannot help but be influenced by it. His approach to songwriting, harmony, singing touched anyone who ever picked up an acoustic guitar and tried to learn his songs. His approach to life and his willingness to speak out when he saw injustice made it easy for this Lutheran Christian to become a member of Amnesty International and raise his own voice when the cause was just and courage was required. Thank you, Peter. May your memory be a blessing, and may God forever hold you in the palm of His hand. ​ - Mike Russo Peter, I met you when I was 15, in 1960 at Hampshire Lodge. We had a folk music counselor who was not working out, and he quit after two weeks. Arnold (camp director) came to me and Peter Siegel, because we were the main folkies at camp, and asked us who he should try to hire in the middle of the summer. We had both seen you on a Hootenanny TV show singing \"Buddy Can You Spare a DIme,” and we said he should try to find you. And he did--I think you were in Woodstock, NY--and you came to camp and became our beloved folk music counselor! You were so much a people person, and we had a blast for the rest of the summer. You helped us have a big camp hootenanny with lots of kids performing. I particularly remember you teaching us \"Put it on the Ground,\" a humorously sarcastic old Wobbly song (which later became part of the PPM union medley) that we sang with gusto and everyone loved! Peter S. even wrote a verse about you, that cracked us all up. I still have the piece of paper that he scribbled it on. I've thought of you often over the years; we did meet up a few times when I lived in Los Angeles and I came to your concerts, but it's been many years. I also found out much later that my cousin (and stepsister) Nina Burt is also your cousin. My father eventually married her mother, which is how we’re related in two ways. You have lived such an admirable life and contributed so much to society and to the world. I remember you so well after all these years, and still appreciate the tremendous enthusiasm you brought to us at camp, and to your audiences throughout the years. Please know I am thinking of you. Love and hugs, Leslie Zeveloff Peter, You met my wife, Jean Hackman Chalk, one summer at the National Music Camp in Michigan. In 1963-64, PP&M played Texas A&M. I left a note backstage for you and joined by Mary, we spent an hour or two at the faculty club talking about the civil rights movement which Jean and I worked in. That evening, you brought the house down at your beautiful concert. Years later you, Jean, and I met for dinner in Montreal, following your solo concert at Concordia University, where I've worked since 1964. You very humoursly invited Jean to dump me so the two of you could run off together. My son and his wife loved it. Jean died on December 11, 2023. I'm sure her spirit will be delighted to sing with you again. Thanks for being such a fine promoter of decent values all these years. You will always be with us. ​ - Frank Chalk Hi Peter! This is Terry the minister who works with homeless people in Staten Island. We had a drink together last year when you did a spectacular solo performance on the west side in a club. you were working on some new music you shared with me. But I really know you from the many times over this last decade that you sat with my mom after your concert and sang to her her favorite song. “If I Had a Hammer.” Her name was Gloria. she had dementia and couldn’t talk but she could sing to the very end and your songs brought her to life so many times in her last years. Thank you for making her spirits rise through your song and for the honor and human dignity you bestowed on her by the love and attention you gave to her after each concert. The gift of that dignity is priceless. I will always be eternally grateful to you. You might meet my mother, Gloria one day in the other side of Jordan. Give her a kiss for me. Thank you Peter. These two words “thank you” are not sufficient to express my gratitude to you and for you! We won’t let the light go out —ever. ​ - Terry Troia I met Peter at s PP&M concert, at the start of their fame, at the Gate of Horn on Rush Street in Chicago. The group, its dynamic and harmony, at such a small site, was overwhelming. I became friends with all three, but had great conversation with Peter. We became friends for the rest of our lives. As we both were active in the civil rights and anti-war movements, with Peter working with McCarthy and I with Bobby Kennedy, our paths crossed throughout the 60's. When the reunion concerts commenced, living in Houston, we would get together every year. Bethany stayed at our house and helped with my son's entry to Yale, and saw Chris play base rhythm for a Peter performance. Let just say they (human's) do not come better than Peter Yarrow!!! I recall one of the leaders of the Selma 25th reunion asking me how to get in touch with him as he was a leader of that protest. When I did he was invited to appear. But, to prove my point, his good friend Harry Belafonte called him and told him that because of what he had done he must appear with him at the ceremonial concert! Peter, I love you dearly, you deserve only the best in life, and we will always be best friends forever and ever!!! Best to Bethany and Chris. Love, Marty Peter, Paul and Mary were the soundtrack of my life. Starting when I was about age 11, when their first album came out, I would always ask my mom to get me a PPM album as a birthday gift. I was fortunate to see them perform during their 25th anniversary tour at Proctor’s Theatre in Schenectady, and again after Mary had been diagnosed with cancer. I also saw him answer phones during Schenectady's WMHT auctions, and perform with his family in the GE Theatre when he autographed \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" books for my young nephews. The pure love for singing, the harmonies that always resonated, the joy that was so clearly evident when they were on stage together. And later in my life, when the LifeLines CD was released, one song in particular always had me in tears because my wonderful mom had Alzheimer's. From \"But a moment\" ... \"Memories move us past each other, Time is a ribbon without end. Love is the lesson we keep learning. Death but a moment we must spend.\" Thank you, Peter, for always teaching love. Thank you for always singing joy. Thank you for being such a significant part of my musical journey. Your light will never go out. ​ - Ricki Shapiro The influence that Peter Yarrow had on my own development as a guitarist and folk music lover has been quite dramatic. Being a child of the 50s, and growing into the folk era of the 60s, I was absolutely mesmerized by the trio of Peter, Paul, and Mary. I wanted to learn to play a guitar when I was about 13 years old, but began with an old ukulele found in my aunt's closet. I took it along to Girl Scout campouts, singing \"500 Miles\" and \"Puff the Magic Dragon\". Soon, I was ready to make the jump to a full sized guitar, and other songs from their repertoire came my way...... \"Bamboo\" , \"If I Had My Way\", \"See What Tomorrow Brings\", and \"If I Had a Hammer\", just to name a few. Their songs were my own personal soundtrack to who I was..... I was the \"folk singer of my graduating class\", and quite proud of this fact. Luckily, it followed me into my college years..... and surprisingly enough led me to meeting my husband, who also was a HUGE PP&M fan! We each had such a rich history of learning repertoire that we were soon a novelty duo at our campus Coffee Houses. We took all of this music along with us on our journey into adulthood, raised our two children hearing and learning many of the songs that were constantly played on our record player..... and Cassette Tape Player in our car. We actually attended many of the live performances by the trio over the years..... Surprisingly, there was one particular event at Indiana University with Peter Yarrow as a solo performer. I think that was sometime in 1972. We jumped at the chance to see this performance! Peter sang a song called \"River of Jordan\" that has stuck with me for such a long, long time. It impacted my life greatly, and my husband and I performed it many, many times for functions. And now, fast forward...... Our two children are grown, and we are grandparents. We are now into our 70s....We are still playing our guitars together at a church Coffee House that I organize, and not an evening goes by without a song that was arranged by Peter, Paul, and Mary. It is part of who we were.... and most definitely part of who we have become. Thank you, Peter, for all of what you gave to us in your journey. It has helped us with our own journey immensely. We love you! ​ - Beth Reasoner Sending so much love to Peter. I followed Peter, Paul, and Mary going to many concert. My interest in Live Music came from watching them. I ended up in Minneapolis volunteering at the Coffeehouse Extempore and and attending St Joan of Arc church. When I was young I waited after a concert for 2 hours to meet them. Peter came out and wrote on my ticket ‘keep your light shining’. Thru many trials in my life I remember what he wrote and ‘keep my light shining’. He so impacted my life with their songs, their activism, the lives they touched with their messages. As an adult my two best friends were Bill Staines and Jerry Rau, both troubadours and both excellent song writers as well. They have travelled on 3 years ahead of you but they are sure to meet you on this next journey. Thank you Peter for dedicating your life to good, to justice. You are loved and you have taught us all. Sending you so much love. - Jana Hi Bethany we've met singing Puff, when Peter, as usual, got people in the audience up on stage at some conference I was at. Peter, I first met you at our convention, National Assoc. of Secondary School Principals. I was Director of Student Activities and I was in charge of our student organizations: Nat'l Assoc. of Student Councils,(NASC) and the National Honor Societies. The Don't Laugh at Me project was just getting started and our student groups were a prime audience. You may recall that we invited you to make remarks and sing a few songs at our NASC Conference which was being held in CA. We were at Stanford University's outdoor amphitheater. We were told there wasn't much time because our closing presenter ended with a candle lighting ceremony. You were really getting into singing to this young audience. However, I was told by the conference director that this had to end because the bus drivers would go over the time they could drive in a day. Two thousand students and their advisers would be stranded at Stanford University. It all worked out and we laugh about it, now. But it shows that when Peter Yarrow feels strongly about something and a wrong needs to be righted, it's hard to stop him. I'd like to feel that student councils became part of those who are helping to right the school bullying situation. You were always kind to those of us involved in Don't Laugh at Me. When performing at Wolf Trap near Washington, DC, you always provide comp tickets to PPM concerts and then have a gathering afterward. You also sent me a wonderful painting that you painted which I have hanging in our home. I haven't seen you in a while but every time I hear or see your name mentioned it brings back fond memories. While I was looking for a photo of us, I found your 2006 Holiday Greeting Letter from Operation Respect which was about the 1963 March on Washington and being on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with Dr. King. On another letter, I loved the words you wrote in handwriting, \" My brother and my friend....and closing with, \"In struggle still, and onward.\" Thank you, Peter Yarrow, for fighting the good fight. You will always be remembered! ​ - Rocco Marano Peter, where to begin? P, P and M were such an integral part of my High School and college years and still today, at age 79 rarely a day goes by that my Martin and I don't relive one or two of those great songs you all blessed us with. There have been some wonderful groups through the years but none can match PP and M for amazing harmonies and instrumentation. I have wanted to thank you all for a long time. I'm sorry to hear of your diagnosis but am very glad you have loving family folks to see you out of this world and into the next. You will be remembered with great affection for your incomparable music, your dedication to social causes and your own good self. Please share these thoughts with Paul when you next see him. You three were always the best! Hilliard Jolly, Dalton, GA, a devoted fan from the earliest days. The first song my father played for me when I came home from the hospital as a tiny, premature little guy was \"Day is Done\". I'd guess \"Puff\" was likely the second song. I suppose from that moment I have been a fan of Peter, Paul and Mary. I was also fortunate to have attended the Peter, Paul and Mary show August 27, 2006 at the Ravinia Festival near Chicago. As much of a blur as that night was, your calm, soft and quiet demeanor has always stuck with me. Peter - thank you for who you are, and who you have always been. You are an icon...a gift we didn't deserve but were so incredibly fortunate to receive. Words will never be enough. Peace and comfort be with you. -Tom Hello Peter. This comes to you from the other side of the earth, from Adelaide in South Australia. Your music had a significant impact on people like me in my community. I was born in 1953 so I’m talking about the mid-late 60’s. In fact it may have been that we were re-discovering music you had performed and recorded about 5 years earlier when yourselves entered my consciousness. My sister was more into Elvis and the Righteous Brothers. We, that is my cohort, were 15-16 in about 1968 and starting to perform with folk groups and rock bands, totally self-taught. My musical career led me through rock to a jug and string band from about 1971-1974. We are giving that genre one more go at the moment with rehearsals. But your little singing group were always considered simply the best. Anyway, we were mesmerised by your trio. I still am. Twenty years ago a friend of mine who was with me in an acoustic trio we had at the time, had partnered with a much younger woman who was probably born in the early 80’s and I gave them a lift in the car and your music was playing. I don’t know why but after a while I asked her if she wanted to listen to something else and she said no – she said it was the most beautiful singing she had heard for a long while. But back to the 60’s- I can only thank you three and, I guess, Albert Grossman. I mention Albert because I have arguments with people who have watched inside Llewyn Davis and read a little and watched Don’t Look Back – we argue about Albert and regardless of what sort of person he was I have to thank him for bringing a lot of first class performers into our orbit. I have many books and CD’s from the Washington Square/ Village music scene and have a feel for the scene as much as anyone can have who wasn’t there at the time. Between 2005 and about 2017 our daughter lived in NYC and we visited many times always staying in the Washington Square Hotel and spending much time in the Square. My mate Tony and I even busked there once. He’d brought his banjo with him from Adelaide and I went around and ‘rented’ a bass from the guy in the Music Inn. Actually I bought it – an acoustic bass – for $350 and he promised to buy it back later in the day for $300 which he did. We had visited the bar where the Gaslight was which had become the Up and Up. This was about 2012. I felt the immense spirit of the location but that was lost on most people there but so it goes. The same went for the park itself. I had a sense of what it was like to go there on a weekend. I had lived through an era with no television and we would be out all day doing what we liked. Had I been a bit older and living in NYC I know what I would have been doing those weekends. But much of that history was not known to me then or until we started going to NYC each year to visit our daughter. Let me return to the impact of your trio. My introduction to you was beyond the early 60’s period but as I said before I was absolutely stunned by the combination of voices and that it seemed so natural. It’s only later that I learned that your selection of melody lines within those harmonies was so perfect and you must have worked so hard on the phrasing. It would come as no surprise that I also followed The Manhattan Transfer throughout their performance years and again was fascinated by their harmonies and discipline. I think that’s another thing that you brought to music was, apart from the discipline to work out those harmonies and all the phrasing, the wonderful stage presence where you would change positions seamlessly between songs depending on who was featuring. Then the guitars. I can only assume you lifted guitars to get them picked up more in the vocal microphones but it looked so powerful and in control. The picking - sometimes one of you up the neck and again phrased so well. The whole presentation seemed to me to be faultless and yet I’m sure the hard work in preparing all that was missed by so many. People I’ve played with since, and in doing your songs, just won’t submit to the discipline and rehearsal needed to get the voices sounding as one with the correct harmonies and phrasing. In Australian parlance you are now facing what we would call a gigantic shit sandwich. But just take solace in the fact that people are thinking about you and you must feel a great deal of pride for what you did. Your songs, your concerts are classics are etched in this poor soul’s mind. You guys were so powerful. The hair, the suits, the posture - it possibly hasn’t ever been equalled except for the aforementioned TMT but they needed a backing band. You did it all yourself. Amazing. That’s What You Get for Lovin Me. What a great arrangement. Challenging lyrics these days but Gordon Lightfoot songs were a good choice. You turned them into something so tender and yet cutting. Then my favourite Early Morning Rain. I loved performing that in our trio. I wish I could talk to you more about those days but I suspect they were a hard slog touring, recording, arranging and so on. And the idyllic Washington Square Park experience was probably as crusty and difficult as they say it is today. But as I write this it gives me much joy to watch and think about those days. I’m reminded of the last words in the film Camelot: Ask every person if he’s heard the story and tell it strong and clear if he has not… Don’t let it be forgot that once there was a spot for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot. It’s a wonderful thought and one I will carry with me. I’ll continue to take on the task and at every gathering play my favourite PPM songs and tell the story and not let it be forgot. Thankyou Don Wilson dear mr. Yarrow, I’d like to tell you how much your music has meant to me. When I was maybe 10 years old in the 1970s, my grandmother gave me the 45rpm singles my uncle had left behind in the Netherlands when he emigrated to Canada. Among those was “Blowin’ in the Wind / Flora”, and especially “Flora” blew my mind! Apart from the beauty of the song itself (that melancholy drop from major to minor in the line “still I love my faithless Flora” - shivers down my spine!), I couldn’t imagine how you and Noel (Paul) managed that amazing guitar tapestry - I still can’t. That same uncle sent us your “In Concert” live album later, and your music has been with me ever since. I could even gauge my progress of English at school by how much sense the lyrics made. I played the piano since I was a 6yr old girl, and taught myself guitar by trying to copy the guitar lines from “A-Soalin’” - I guess it was good that by then I hadn’t yet seen that live recording of “Jane, Jane” from the Andy Williams show, because I feel that’s hands down the most astonishing live performance I’ve ever seen - by anyone. I could go on like that - what I’m trying to say is that I’m so grateful that the three of you gave the world something so beautiful that it will live forever. Thank you Maike Dulk, the Netherlands My Brother Peter, You have been a treasure in my life and Leah's. We are so glad that we could sit with you at dinner the last time you were in Minneapolis, and we were ouched that you dedicated a song to me. An enduring memory. Also enduring are your contributions to Braver Angels. When Gail Sheehy told you about our first workshop, you immediately knew there was gold in that work. I felt so encouraged that a \"deep blue\" like you shared our vision of common humanity across this form of color divide. You brought us inspiration, energy, and music, not to mention a splendid documentary that has been proven to change people. I told you when we first met that your music of the early sixties awakened my social conscience when I was in my teens. As I turn 80 this spring, your effect on me is no less strong. Blessings and love from me and Leah. ​ - Bill Doherty Hello Peter dear, You and I were best friends for all the four years we were at the High school of Music and Art together. I came from a traumatized home, and your spirit and intensity and joy carried me everyday. We were both avid students and had so much to talk about; but mainly it was about our studies and how this learning thrilled us. But we also played games with each other after school. Innocently, and non-sexually, with eyes closed, we would put the other's index finger tip on our skin somewhere, and we would have to guess what part of the body we touched. In our senior year, i became the Salutatorian of our class, and you were so generous in helping me compose my speech. You were so selfless and patient and smart! Thank you, Peter, for your friendship and your opening up my horizons. with deep affection and gratitude, Lillian Wishnia Rand. Dearest Peter, 12/22/2024: How does one properly say goodbye to such a great friend during the sunset of their life? I wish to express my deepest gratitude for all that you have given to not just me, but our entire world. I wish that I could be with you during this time of sacred solace. Please know my heart is with you, and all of your loved ones. Your words “love, inspiration, and heART”, have echoed through my existence since you first spoke them to me in my 2012 Occupy Maine TV interview with you. [Please see my interview with Peter Yarrow about the links between his work with the Civil Rights Movement, the March on Washington (which he helped to organize), and his work with Occupy Wall Street and Environmental Justice Movements. Also note “Bidder 70” (a film that Peter helped to create), featuring his friend Tim DeChristopher of Peaceful Uprising, who more recently Founded the Climate Disobedience Center: https://youtu.be/8pmNg2-X8mQ ] “Love inspiration and heART”, and your living examples have infused me beyond gratitude for the time you gave me, the wisdom you imparted on me, and the support you offered as my Dear Friend over these decades. I cannot thank you enough for what you have meant to me. After watching the PBS special about Rabbi Abraham Heschel, I finally realized that what I saw in you and your unique lived journey, with Peter, Paul and Mary, especially with your ecological rights advocacy, and on your own, was akin to my own wish. After taking a K-12 elective class on the Holocaust in sixth grade, I would cry myself to sleep asking, “How can I make up in my own small soul shell for the tragedy caused by so many?” And I have come to see in your work that you were successful in doing just that, i.e., making up in your own lives for the tragedy caused by so many, and with singing, joy, and laughter. I also have a deep respect for your work for world peace, especially in the Middle East, and Central America supporting the environment, including stopping Fracking and solving our Climate Crisis, and for your founding of Operation Respect. Thus your productions with PBS, were that much more meaningful in my life. Peter thank you, your friendship has shaped my worldview of the need for Peace and Ecological Justice in our world. This wisdom that has evolved from our meetings will always be a treasure in my heart. Peter, thank you, your friendship has opened my perspective, and your careful attention to not just my growth as an Ecological Advocate and Songwriter, but the growth of my compassionate service to our world has given me a sense of validation and courage for my own devotions to World Peace, especially with my Career Mindfulness Counseling Curriculum idea, and my White House Testimony about the American Climate Corps, including my proposal to incorporate everyone into the process of solving our Climate Crisis. You have always been a real gentleman with me, and I have borne witness to the fact that you have endeavored to use your life as a conduit of historic Social and Ecological Change. Although we will miss you here on Earth, I will always have a wonderful sense that your joyous spirit will be looking over us with your gentle hearted smile, always praying for our positive evolution of life on Earth. Peter I will remain here, just one of the torchbearers of your living legacy. With Universal Love, Heidi J Vierthaler I was 6 years old when my mother took me to see PPM at the oakdale theater in the early 1990s. I was obsessed with PPM; I would use a plunger as my microphone and sing along to the pbs specials that my mother recorded on vhs. I don’t know how but at that particular concert, we managed to attend a “meet and greet” and it was Peter who was the most gracious toward me. We sat in “star aisle” and each band member at some point interacted with me during the show. It was magic! Years later, circa 2003, I saw PPM in concert again, I believe in Stamford. I was a teenager then and once again, I had an opportunity to meet the band. I told Peter how we had met years earlier at my first concert and then he introduced me to Mary Travers as “his old friend.” I lost my younger sister pediatric brain cancer in the 90s and had a difficult childhood… it was your music that got me through some of the darkest days of my life and instilled in me a sense of justice that I now teach my own young children. Thank you for the music and the memories. I won’t let the light out. McCabe's Guitar Shop in Santa Monica, sometime in the late 1970's: I met Peter Yarrow and heard him perform solo (having seen PPM before, I know I was in for a treat!) in a little room behind the store. What a lovely, genuine, down-to-earth man! I felt so nervous, having never met anyone famous and reluctant to say hello, he assuaged my fears and made me feel like we were old friends meeting again. I will never forget that intimate performance and his warm, welcoming manner afterward. Now if I could only find an mp3 (I'm 71; I still use my rotary-dial iPod!) of his song That's Enough For Me, though thankfully I do still have and listen to my LP of that album from back in the day. Thank you, Peter, for a lifetime of wonderful music! ​ - Mary Stanton-Anderson In May of 1985 or 1986 Peter was to give a concert in Chicago. I believe he was to speak/sing at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), where I was attending. At UIC that afternoon the Jewish students were having a celebration and it was disrupted by a very large group of Palestinian student protesters who took the stage, eventually things quite and Peter got up and spoke briefly from his heart. I happened to be at the event as a Jewish student and I was with my Muslim friend, Aliya. Aliya and I had formed a group called PEACE-- People Encouraging Acceptance through Communication and Education and we were able to quickly tell Peter about our group right after he spoke. Peter invited us and our families to his concert in the city that evening and we went on, with his guidance and blessing, to do wonderful things on campus for the next several years in the name of PEACE. Peter gave us nearly front row seats AND gave a shout-out and tribute to our UIC PEACE group during his concert. He has inspired me to continue working for PEACE. I have been a reform rabbi in the Chicago area now for over 25 years-- Peter had much to do with how I work for peace and communication today. I am grateful for all that he has done for us, for the world. Much Love and Many blessings, Peter. ​ - Lisa Bellows San Juan, Puerto Rico. Peter, you flew down from where you were to offer a concert in celebration of Temple Beth Shalom of PR's 40th anniversary. Come Saturday morning, Rabbi Elliot Kleinman (your dear friend and our friend) led the service. MY Peter and I led the music. YOU, Peter sat in the front row. Talk about turn-about, except we'd never sat in the first row of one of your concerts. You smiled. I see that smile now. Time for the final song, Light One Candle. You began. MY Peter notice that his guitar was in tune with yours. His guitar wanted to join your guitar. A villain appeared in the form of me! I thought it inappropriate for MY Peter to horn in on YOU, Peter. YOU, Peter, nodded to MY Peter, who proudly stepped up to join you. Then I joined the two Peters. For the rest of Light One Candle, Peter, Peter & Amy lit up a synagogue's sanctuary in San Juan. The purveyor of our lives' music gave us a memory. Eternal gratitude. ​ - Amy Dattner & Peter Levy It was 1990 and Peter came to Buffalo, NY to help celebrate the 75th Anniversary of Temple Beth Zion. I was tech producing this special evening and during soundcheck Peter and I reminisced about the times we worked together in the past. He then told me about his friendship with my brother Barry who once helped out in carving pathways for necessary medical care for a family member. It was an evening I've never forgotten. - Larry Scheur Peter Yarrow has had a huge impact on my life-from his days with Peter, Paul and Mary to his sharing of the song \"Don't Let The Light Go Out\" which I have sung many times in my role as Cantor. Peter Yarrow's musical gifts, his work for justice, his kindness and his enormous heart made the world a much better place for everyone in it. Inspired by his words and wanting to give back to Peter Yarrow, I composed this folksong two days ago after a visit from his friend Aimee Ginsburg Bikel. Here uploaded are the lyrics (the first verse is his). I sent the song to Aimee and hopefully she will send it along. I hope Mr. Yarrow is comfortable and taking in all the love that surrounds him by people near and far. Thank you for all you have given us. ​ - Cantor Rita Glassman ​ THERE IS ONLY ONE RIVER Inspired by the words of Peter Yarrow Music and additional lyrics by Rita Glassman There is only one river, there is only one sea And it flows through you, and it flows through me There is only one people, we are one and the same We are all one spirit, we are all one name. There is only one planet, a home for us all We must care for it well, we must hear the earth’s call She is crying out, for she needs our love From the oceans below to the skies above There is one more thing I hope you will do Make a friend when you can with someone different than you It will heal this world, if we can all get along For a start, let’s begin by singing this song! I first met Peter in rehearsal with NY Choral Society to back up PPM for Christmas concert at Carnegie Hall. The chorus was admonished: 'Don't talk to the celebrities.' Still on a break Peter and I passed each other in the aisle and I thanked him for his email about Vietnam Fund for Reconciliation and said I'd probably send a check. He said no, come to the lunch. So I did the next day. When I told my story at the door about having sung w Peter the night before at Carnegie, they seated me right next to Peter at the lunch. We talked a lot especially about charitable causes. I thanked Peter then for \"the consistency, constancy and the correctness of his message\". We went on to raise a lot of money together not only for Vietnam but especially for OR. I met Bethany several times and Christopher once at fundraisers at P's UWS apartment, me being UWS-er as well. I sang with Peter and Peter and Paul many more times. Once I skiied with Peter in Telluride and was a guest at his home there. I grilled salmon steaks on his grill. As I said to you early on in our friendship brother Peter, thank you for allowing me into your life. It is one of the greatest gifts ever given me in my life. Your brother, Eric It was an absolute honor to have you grace The Outpost in the Burbs stage in Montclair, New Jersey not once, but twice. The first time was for a touching tribute to Paul Colby, where you joined the ranks of 7 legends at the Bitter End before bringing your magic to our stage in 2010. The second time, you returned for a captivating solo performance. On both occasions, our audience was privileged to experience not just your remarkable talent and music, but also the essence of your spirit and the inspiration you have shared with others over the years. Your positive influence and role model status have touched countless lives, leaving a lasting imprint. Your music is a timeless gift that will continue to resonate. Thank you for the beautiful music! With love and appreciation from everyone at Outpost in the Burbs “And if you take my hand my son All will be well when the day is done And if you take my hand my son All will be well when the day is done Day is done, day is done, day is done, day is done” ​ - Gail Prusslin Dear Sir;. Mr. Yarrow, may I respectfully and sincerely submit that you and Mr. Stookey have been more than a source of musical entertainment in my life, you have been the link and soul-source of my strength and inspiration. I have been a professional musician for almost 70 years and mastered several instruments after my Father,gave me my first lesson when I was just a young boy. My much-loved Dad was also a wonderful guitarist like yourself and Mr. Stookey. Of late, it has been Parkinson's, Pulmonary Embolisms and Diabetes that have disabled me and stolen away any and all my ability to play any of the instruments that I formerly took great pride in achieving. I confess that I hide behind the term 'disabled', because the title of 'Invalid' is too close to the the cruelly descriptive term 'in-valid' and I staunchly believe that my life still has validity! Since I also cannot drive a car or even walk more than a few steps without a walker or a wheelchair handy, my wife Sheri regularly knocks herself out taking care of me, three dogs and a cat, while also mantaining our home, taking responsibility for our debts, mounting medical bills, and utilities, as well as welcoming our children and grandchildren into our home when it is at all possible for them to make it. Sheri has been damaging her own health in preparing to make the upcoming Christmas holiday EXTRA sprcial for all of our family, but I can see it well enough without her admitting it that her exhausting pace in attempting to make this the BEST Christmas ever is bcause the odds are that this is probably the last Christmas that I will be aroud for. Years ago, we lost a son to childhood brain cancer and Sheri and I both lost our minds for a while. Your courage, dedication and the messages of hope that you and Mr. Stookey have taught me through your music and the power of both your personal characters, (as well as your warm hearts and humor,) has held me up, aided me with each tiny step taken and gifted me with the power of faith to endure each trial that life has offer, especially after our son passed away when I thought I would die also. (Or maybe I just wanted to die like our son.) Maybe the bottom line is that you, Mr. Stookey and my dear wife, (Peter, Paul and Sheri?) have taught me of the true strength of compassion and the unconditonal love that the Lord God has provided for all of us, if we only reach out our hands and hearts and accept the gifts of forgiveness and the infinite tender merces that the Lord is holding for each of us. I long forward to the day when I can again see my poor infant son, suddenly grown tall and strong and perfect in the light of the Lord's grace in Paradise. To me, it will mean years passing slowly. For my son who dwells now in the heavenly embrace of the Lord God, it will only have been seconds in time. My fear is gone. But my debt to you and Noel Paul can never be adequately repaid. I had a child's dream for the longest time that one day I would know positively that all the hours and hours of practice that I devoted to practicing, playing and singing would enable me to somehow perform even one song on stage with you. Well, thanks to all the lessons that you and Noel Paul Stookey have blessed me with, I'll be looking for you (with my guitar in hand,) soon after St. Peter lets me through the pearly gates. (And immediately after I flag down my Father and my son!) Thank you, my friend and my brother! - James Rupert 1) I saw Peter, Paul and Mary perform at Westbury Music Fair. I caught him walking around the top of the theater and told him I had seen him 30 years earlier at a Nation Student Association Conference in D.C. He said somethin like \"You're a leftie from way back\". I took it as a badge of honor. 2) Peter played at Landmark on Main Street in Port Washington. For his encore, he invited everyone onto the stage to sing with him. I was one of about 30 from the audience who joined him. I still tell people I sang Puff the Magic Dragon on stage with Peter Yarrow. ​ - Robert Kleinman Peter - As a youngster I learned to play guitar listening to you. As an adult, I had the life changing opportunity to be part of your musical family as we worked on several albums together, and eventually musical directing your band for the live LifeLines concert on PBS. You subsequently asked me to help out with a concert for your old elementary school, and how could I say no. And for my little part, I wrote this song because there was apparently already a song about a dragon. You seemed tickled by it then, and I hope to tickle you with it again now. Here it is again, with love and respect. Little Petey Piglet. Lyrics below. LITTLE PETEY PIGLET WAS A REALLY UGLY PIG ALL FAT AND PINK AND FILTHY AND HIS NOSE WAS REALLY BIG HE SMELLED REAL BAD - THAT MADE HIM SAD CAUSE HE WAS LONELY EVERY DAY AND AS HE'D GO TO SLEEP EACH NIGHT YOU COULD HEAR HIM PRAY... (OINK OINK OINK OINK OINK...) LITTLE PETEY PIGLET THOUGHT HE HAD A FRIEND NAMED BOB BUT BOB WOULD NEVER VISIT CAUSE BOB, HE HAD A JOB BESIDES, HE HAD NO WAY TO KNOW WHERE PETEY EVEN STAYED AND EVERY NIGHT WHEN THE MOON WAS BRIGHT PETEY PIGLET PRAYED... (OINK OINK OINK OINK OINK...) THEN ONE DAY IT HAPPENED LITTLE PETEY HAD TO GO WE'RE NOT SURE JUST WHERE HE WENT BUT I THINK INSIDE, I KNOW THIS MORNING WITH MY BREAKFAST I THOUGHT I HEARD THE STRANGEST THING I LOOKED DOWN AT MY BACON AND I SWEAR I HEARD IT SING IT SANG... (OINK OINK OINK OINK OINK...) Love, Doug It is difficult to express just how much Peter means to me and to my family. My mother became a fan and follower of Peter Paul and Mary in the 60’s and gifted this love and appreciation to my sister and me as we grew up. I grew up listening to their music on weekend mornings, on car trips, and especially at the holidays as the Holiday album became a staple in our family. Puff the Magic Dragon has always been a symbol of love and the wonder of childhood and the deep joy and healing that stems from loving one another. Light One Candle is a particular favorite of mine and lights up the dark days of winters for me. The PPM rendition of Children Go Where I Send Thee became a Christmas favorite for us, and every year, to this day, my mom, sister and I joyfully usher in the holiday season by singing it together. The sixth verse, which Peter sings, is a soulful and meaningful favorite, and it still gives me chills when I listen to it and sing along, just as the final verse of Puff the Magic Dragon does. When my sister and I were young my parents took us to PPM concerts a few times. At one we eagerly waited after the show to see if we could meet Peter, Paul or Mary. My mom had written a letter to them, which she somehow passed backstage, telling them how much they meant to our family, how my sister watched a recording of the Christmas Together televised concert and would pretend to flip her hair to the side like Mary so dramatically did, and how much we loved verse 6. Peter came out to greet fans in the theater, having read the letter, and he took my six year old sister on his lap and sang a verse of the song to her. It is etched in all of our memories as an incredibly special moment that none of us will forget. It’s incredibly sad to think of Peter leaving this earthly world, but I hope he knows - and I hope his family knows - how powerfully he has impacted so many people through his beautiful music, songwriting, and humanity, my tiny family and myself included. It brings me such joy to pass his music along to my children, who are now buoyed by it as well. Wishing peace to Peter and his family in this difficult time. ​ - Jen Dear Peter, Although you and I have never formally met, your music and devotion to music - and to humanity through music - has been part of my life-long calling as a musician. I'm writing to deeply thank you for everything you've given, taken on, and come through, to be the generous person and artist you are. I was 6 years old on a family vacation when I first discovered Peter, Paul and Mary. An older cousin sat me down in front of his record player, put on your first album, and showed me how to replay it, which I did again and again, absolutely enthralled. It was my introduction to harmony singing. By week's end I'd learned all the parts (can sing some by heart even now, nearly 60 years later) :-). Later, when \"The Great Mandella\" came on the radio, I heard how one could open up the whole fabric of possibility for a caring world through lyrics and melody in a way that none of my earlier listens to different social justice musics (part of my upbringing) had yet shown me. Part of it was the song's point of view, the relationships all present in dialogue....Part of it your poignant voice. Tenderness, strength, vision, chutzpah. I was too young to understand the subtleties, ironies and implications of the song in context, but I was already awakened to my own path of activism, already singing against the war in Vietnam (in fact, my first public performance was in a grade school assembly, offering an a cappella solo version of “The Cruel War” in protest). Your song showed me a path to the complexities made possible poetically in songs with melodies that stick and circle - as the great wheel of life does. Thank you forever for that! I became a performing songwriter, and some many years later a finalist in the Kerrville Festival's New Song contest... a community which has changed my life several times, and is a \"home\" to this day. Ever grateful to you and Rod Kennedy for all you envisioned and birthed. And one more time and place of synthesis: Sometime in the 90's, at a Folk Alliance conference, you, Alan Lomax, and might it have been Jean Ritchie, gave a panel on \"Songs that Last.\" I still remember in my bones the simplicity and conviction present in each of you as you spoke of the power of all that's distilled in the old songs. Again, you imparted a path, an even deeper naming and affirmation about what a musician and carrier of songs is, does, and can be. Had I quite realized your impact on me personally, I may have been in touch sooner! Ah…you have my undying thanks. As gratitude, like love, goes on and on, before, through, and after us, like the songs that last. You’ve touched more people than anyone will ever know. And you’ll be remembered and appreciated always, for so, so, many blessings….for generations…. With love, in the great circle of life and time, Judith-Kate Dear Peter: I'll start by saying \"thank you.\" To you for sharing your music, and to your family for sharing you. I grew up in the '70s and '80s with a folk music-loving father. We listened to Peter, Paul and Mary regularly on the family room stereo. On weekends, the family migrated to the living room where we kept the piano and a variety of songbooks. Dad played Peter, Paul and Mary on his guitar, and we sang along with him. In December 1987, I was fortunate to travel to Washington, DC for the Soviet Jewry Rally and hear you perform live. I was only in 10th grade, but the import of the moment was clear. Soon after, if I remember the dates correctly, Dad asked me if I wanted to see Peter, Paul and Mary in concert. I thought he was joking, but he assured me that you were on tour, and that he would take me to see you even though it was on a school night. After the show, you came off the stage to greet the audience. You asked me how old I was and then commented to that your son was about the same age and maybe some matchmaking was in order. The dads chuckled. Teen girl mortification! But it was a magical evening. Your music has remained a part of my life. My husband and I last saw you perform in 2018, but Dad was not well enough to join us. Peter, Paul and Mary was on the rotation we played for my father in his last days to bring peace to us all in a challenging time, but a time that was also full of love. My younger son, who plays guitar, will play “Light One Candle” when Chanukah begins this week. I am going to ask him to channel his grandfather and lead us in a full song session. Your music and messages will live on for generations. ​ - Rachel Armel Gebaide My dearest Peter...I love you so much...remembering the sweetly hip, lanky kid in scraggy jeans who showed up at the Ash Grove with a guitar, grit and glossy, curly hair that looked better than mine. In retrospect... what I remember still so vividly is your sweetness, the love, kindness and hugs back then and over all these years... and yes we sang 'there's a hole in the bucket' on stage...what we shared gave me a sense of family, inclusion, and was deeply healing as I was a foster child, though I never shared that for no particular reason... your love for me, for all the others is a humbling thing, a love that has no barriers, it was, is, for me and everyone in this broken world a grace...and a lesson not too late for the learnin' needed...there's a hole in the bucket and time is running out...hard to find the words. let's sing...blessings to you, Noel, Mary, for all the Light....love you, Lynn Gold Peter- thank you for the joy of your music and the passion of your activism- and the knowledge that both can work in tandem to serve a higher calling in making this a just world for us all. I think I first truly discovered Peter,Paul & Mary as a kind watching those wonderful PBS specials which inspired me to discover your music as a group and as soloist from there. It’s been such a fulfilling, rewarding and heartwarming moment each time I can revisit that glorious music that is now and forever a part of me. I’m count myself lucky to have seen the three of you in concert years ago at the Coral Springs Performing Arts Center in South Florida. Thank you for sharing so much of yourself, your talent and your music with us all. We’ll keep singing, keep fighting and keep loving! ​ - Karen Tabsch Dear Peter, i only just found out about your battle, while look for a songbook, in order to relearn piano after a few decades. I want you to know how important your music has been to my family. My family would drive across Canada each year, after moving away from our extended family in the prairies. My father would play your music on those trips (on 8-track) and sing along and it was magical for my sister and me. Those were such happy times, with all of us singing at the top of our lungs, especially, as children, loving Puff the Magic Dragon. I grew up with Peter, Paul and Mary as a soundtrack to my life and now my daughter, who is 25, thanks me often for listening to such great music during her childhood. My father gave her a CD of yours when she was 2 years old and she's treasured it. Thank you for giving us all so much happiness, so much joy and good times together. We love you and we're still singing along. ​ - Michelle Frey In 2007, when my husband and I were attending our annual Arts Week Retreat in June, which we usually attend at the Unitarian Universalist Conference Center on Star Island in New Hampshire, the retreat was transferred to another UU Conference Center at Ferry Beach in Saco, Maine. I was undergoing intensive Chemotherapy treatment for an aggressive Breast Cancer at the time and had lost all my hair, so I was wearing hats to hide my bald head. It was very traumatic for me. One of the guest artists that year at our conference was none other than the great Peter Yarrow, whom I had seen several times live in concert with Peter, Paul & Mary over the years. I was standing in the main building at Ferry Beach, probably looking rather ill, when all of a sudden this lovely man with the kindest eyes, wearing a poncho and carrying his guitar, saw me across the lobby and walked over to me, making eye contact the whole time and he took my hand in his and kissed it. Neither of us said much in words but everything was said between us with that one kind interaction. It uplifted me and the memory has stayed with me all these years. Thank you, Peter Yarrow, for all the times you helped uplift us all. You are truly a Magical Dragon in my life. From a fellow Unitarian and folk music lover, Janine M. Torsiello from New Jersey. Dearest Peter, there aren't words strong or meaningful enough to tell you how the loving and compassion you have given to me over the years have so greatly impacted my life. When I first got to meet you at the Carter Barron in Washington DC, you immediately took me “under your wing” at a time that I had little confidence in myself and very low self esteem. Not only were you kind to me but you made me feel special for the first time in my life. Over the years, you have never wavered from that and I truly thank you for all you have added to my life. Your genuineness and loving spirit allowed us to become friends and you have enriched my life in ways too numerous to count. I know we haven’t seen each other for a long time, but I cherish the memories of all the times we have been together over the years. We may be out of sight as they say, but you are never out of mind. I am so grateful to God for the blessing of you in my life. Thank you for everything, my dear Peter. I love you very much and will miss you greatly. ​ - Susan Painter The first songs I ever learned by heart as a child were Puff The Magic Dragon and Where Have All The Flowers Gone. Peter, Noel and Mary's music became the inspiration for me as a child and as I \"aged\". Songs like Jet Plane, Early In The Morning even Buddy Montlock's I'm The Kid on Lifelines became synonymous with my life. Today I sing songs like the above and Noel's Wedding Song and For The Love Of It All to keep me sane. Even Peter's rendition of things like Sorrow, Such Is Love, The Marvelous Toy and others all define the last nearly 6 decades of my own life. They give new meaning to making Classics, Modern. Gilbert and Sullivan may have written I Have A Song To Sing O for Yeomen Of The Guard, but hearing Peter, Noel and Mary give new meaning to its lyrics. I have missed Mary's presence for ages now, when Peter goes I will be empty in heart again. When Noel goes and they all can sing again in heaven, I hope I follow him to join in the group. And I hope Dick Kniss is around to play bass for them/us as well. I'll miss you, Peter. For my entire life, it's stuff that you guys wrote and sang that have kept me going all these years. ​ - Eric Pregosin Dear Mr. Yarrow. As stated in my previous letter to you through this tribute page, I have idolized you and your talents and teachings for many years. Over the decades, I have had the priviledge of seeing you perform live probably a dozen times or more in the Nebraska/Midwest area, whether with both Mr. Stookey and Ms. Travers or a few magical occasions when you, with just a voice and guitar, enthralled the crowd as a single as well. You even spoke to me after a couple of the trio's concerts in Lincoln, Nebraska finished, (asking me if i had a filter-tip cigarette!) I have also dreamed of someday being a good enough musician to get up and perform a single song with you, but advancing age and my own illness is making that unlikely for me. The closest that I can get, is a song that I wrote six decades ago trying to sincerely, if only vaguely, recreate the style and harmomy of PP and M, with myself playing and singing all three vocal, guitar and bass parts. The song is entitled,\"Mother at Golgotha\" and it expresses how the Lord gave gave his life and the fear and pain that his earthly Mother had to endure on that black day atop the hill called 'Golgotha.' My purpose is to honor the wonderful music of you and the trio that I have grown both up and old with and to make my tiny contribution to the folk music ethic that I firmly believe will never fade away. I have enclosed an audio file of the song with this letter as a musical gift to you and yours this holy Christmas day to express my respect, admiration and inspiration. But most of all, I give my thanks from my heart and my soul for all the gifts you have given to all of us. So, please let this song be my sincere wish for comfort to you that people who have dearly needed the wisdom of your counsel have truly been listening to your own gentle and loving crusade. I also ask that every blessing be yours, in this world and the next. I hope you enjoy the song and please know how much we all love you, my brother and my friend. - James Rupert. In December 2014, you gave a solo performance at \"Outpost in the Burbs,\" in a church in Montclair, NJ. It was a chilly, rainy evening, but your friends and followers didn't mind waiting outside the venue in anticipation of the concert. We were all having a wonderful time during the first half -- then you said you would be glad to meet with members of the audience in the lobby during intermission -- and even take requests for the second half of the show. I hadn't counted on the modern-day practice of each fan's having to take a \"selfie\" with you -- and so this meet-and-greet took rather longer than the estimated intermission time. The staff came out and indicated that it was time to end it before I could get to speak with you. You were kind enough to take a moment to speak with me as you made your way back to the stage, and I asked you if LIGHT ONE CANDLE was part of the second half of the performance. \"It is now,\" you replied -- and sure enough, you made it the first selection in the second half. I will always remember that kindness -- and the power with which you sang that song. Thank you for all the joy and hope you have brought me over these many years. Bless you, Peter Yarrow. ​ - Susan Cohen DeStefano We had the honor of meeting Peter and Christopher at a concert in the UP of Michigan in 2017. My daughter was 15 at the time, and the youngest in the audience. When we met Peter before the concert, he remarked that my daughter radiates joy ... that is so true and their interaction was precious.We were in the front row when Peter asked for all the kids to come on stage, my daughter Hannah was there! During the singing of Puff, Peter stopped and said to my daughter \"I wrote this song 58 years ago - how come you're singing my song??\" Her response was \"it's a good song and we like it\". He kissed her on top of the head. Such a special experience. I have attached a photo of Christopher, Hannah, and Peter on stage. Here is the link to my youtube video. https://youtu.be/BOS-Vv9KUSc?feature=shared We are watching the holiday concert dvd this evening ... that caused me to check on Peter and Paul. Much love and prayers. ​ - Kerry Ott When I was the education director at Temple Beth Sholom in Sarasota FL, we brought Peter in for a tribute weekend for our Rabbi and to present the Operation Respect experience for our schools. He also performed a concert for the general public at our location and I had the honor of performing with him. A few years later, he helped facilitate the establishment of an anti bullying foundation for me when I moved to a new position in Charlotte NC. He made all of the Operation Respect programs and materials available to us and provided teacher training for our schools over a six year span. Peter came to Charlotte and performed a concert for the community and for our foundation joining me and 25 students from our schools. Peter was more than a mentor and more than an inspiration to me. He was a friend. ​ - Sid Krupkin Dear Peter, Your music and that of Peter Paul and Mary have been the soundtrack of my life since the 1960s. I saw you in concert several times during high school and college. Then I had the privilege of learning from you and singing with you at the URJ Biennial with Rabbi Alan Bregman of blessed memory, when you shared Light One Candle with us following your trip to the FSU. A few years later I listened to you perform at a CAJE conference with my dear friend Debbie Friedman, and singing with you at the late- night Kumsitz! I was so delighted for that more intimate opportunity. I want to thank you for enriching my life immeasurably, with your music, your passion for social justice, and for becoming true friends with some of my favorite people (Deb Friedman, Elliot Kleinman and Alan Bregman. May the lights of Chanukkah and the love of so many bless you along your journey! In love and gratitude, Laura Schwartz Harari Peter, My Dear Friend, My Brother: Who would have imagined that meeting you 36 years ago, would be the beginning of a deep friendship with so many meaningful moments and shared experiences. A friendship that would have such a profound impact on my life, and the lives of so many around me. After meeting you (as a simple window covering salesman in New York City), I mentioned to you that my mother was fighting a tough battle with Cancer. You wrote the moving and uplifting “Harriet’s Song” for her. It has continued to bring hope to countless others facing similar struggles around the world. Since that time in 1988, our friendship has flourished, and you have become one of my dearest friends. You introduced me to your mother Vera, and I adored her and lunched with her many times. Walking on the beach in San Diego with your daughter Bethany, getting to know your son Chris, and watching you all perform together was amazing. You always shared how proud you were of them. And I love how you adored your grand daughter! The memories we have shared together are too numerous to count. From enjoying so many of your performances from the wings of the stage, to celebrating with you, Paul and Mary in the green rooms with your adoring fans, to attending book signings filled with heartfelt moments of connection. There are certain moments that stand out in my mind, such as when you sang for Alex Szekley in his final days. His family was so touched by your kindness and love. This too has blossomed into a decades long friendship, and so often you have gone to Rancho La Puerta to present. On the 1st Anniversary of 9/11, you were in San Diego, and knew it was necessary for you to be involved in the healing process. Together we went to Temple Emanuel, where you sang and spoke at that commemoration, and helped heal so many in attendance. When Marla Bennett, a beloved member of our Jewish Community, with all the promise in the world, was taken from us in a bombing at University in Israel, you came to her memorial service and helped our entire community heal. Four times, you attended the San Diego Rotary Club, singing “This Land is Your Land”, starting the meetings with an unequalled spirit. But on one particular date, we had 60 high school students from a mostly underserved area in San Diego. After the meeting, you gathered them around, and in pure Peter Yarrow style, you lectured and sung to them on the importance of standing up and speaking out for what is right and just. Those students were forever changed in those few minutes. Your ability to inspire and uplift others, especially students, is a true testament to the impact you’ve had on so many lives. I’ll never forget when the Rabbi had you put on a pair of Teffilin, and how touched and connected you were to Judaism. I thank you for the “Front Seat” opportunity to often be a part of this so often. I was always in awe of how you could speak extemporaneously, and so brilliantly. You are the most articulate person I have ever known. Just five years ago, you accompanied me to a friend’s wedding rehearsal dinner and you came along. It was a family in love with folk music, and especially Peter Paul and Mary. Even though we were on our way to another event, you asked me to get your guitar from the car. As everyone sat in the living room, you sung the “Wedding Song” to them. Then, you sung the “Little Blue Frog”, and they all knew the words. Realizing this was a true “Peter Paul and Mary family, you sang for two hours. To this day, they talk of that magical night! And, during one of my toughest times, at the loss of my father, you came to San Diego and opened his funeral with your beautiful song “Sweet Survivor”. That evening, we all walked on the beach and it made the day so much easier for all of us. Your kindness and compassion have been a guiding light in my life, and I am forever grateful for each moment we have shared together. On my 65th Birthday, we had a day filled with laughter, great food, and long walks through lower Manhattan …. The best birthday ever! Your infectious laughter, profound love for others, and unwavering ability to listen have left an indelible mark on my heart. How about our mutual love of flea markets. You have an amazing eye to find the most cool things. And how I somehow was able to bring out a Crazy and Zaney side of you when we were together. Those hysterical moments are replayed every day for me in my memory. Peter, You have taught me patience, understanding, and the true meaning of friendship. Your presence in my life has been a gift beyond measure, and has truly changed me. Thank you for not only being a friend, but a brother to me. I love you, my dear friend, and you will always be alive in my heart. Your Brother: Paul Nestor Your music has been an inspiration, and a steady hope. “Light One Candle” reminds me that we each have a responsibility to keep that hope alive through compassion for one another. You have given this old world a great light that will never go out. Peace to you and your family. - Lynnette Geary May God bless you as you have blessed so many with your beautiful, meaningful music and as a model for life as a deeply joyful mensch. ​ - Sharon Pollin This picture is one of my cherished memories of when Peter and his daughter Bethany dedicated our sanctuary. The nair talmid above our heads in this picture is inscribed with the Hebrew and English “Don’t let the light go out”. What a thrill it was to be asked by Peter to join him to song this song! - Blake Singer Peter, thank you for the years of sharing your music and love with Rebecca Recht z”l. She so loved sing Puff with you. And thank you for taking time to sit with me in Atlanta to talk of sweet Rebecca and reminisce of her much too short life. You are a true mensch dear man. Blessings to you. ​ - Alexandria Shuval-Weiner I was honored to sing at the Kerville Music Festival in Texas back in the day ( Peter’s 70th birthday happened to be that day) He was very generous and told me I was one of the best harmony vocalists he’d heard in a long time and invited me to sit next to him for the concert that evening, where he would be performing! It is one of my fondest memories of my life! Thank you Peter, for your kindness and generosity and of course your music! Xoxo - Adeline Wright Some years ago at a social function, I was asked who I would love to meet in person if I had the opportunity. Without a second thought, my answer was Peter Yarrow. I have long enjoyed his music, his message, his humanity, his kindness and his spirit. I share \"Light One Candle\" every single year with my family and friends. I honor Peter. I am sorry I never got to meet him in person - but in many ways, I feel that I knew him. We all did. Love and Peace to Peter and his loved ones. ​ - Debbie Shapiro Today, as every year , I will sing Light One Candle at our Chanukah Shabbat Service. You are a gem and I will think especially of you, grateful for your talents. I wish you no pain, send love and peace to you. I appreciate and am grateful for you. ​ - Ms. Dale Berman God gives us gifts and talents for His plan of our lives, and then it is our own free-will that determines what we might do with them. In your music you have shown us how we can stretch the boundaries of singing to bring such a myriad of feelings to send messages, to share life across all borders - geographic and personal - and you, Noel Peter, have indeed taken your given gifts and so generously shared them with the world. I am just one recipient who has hummed and sung my way along for so many years and I thank you. May this gift of time to prepare that you now share be a teaching moment for all of us. MRS. - Mary Regina S. I have been deeply touched over the years by Peter and his partners in grace and beauty. Not someone Peter ever knew but so grateful for the opportunity to say “Thank you Peter and God bless you and your family and friends.” Peace be with you! - Ruth Rosenstein Dearest Peter, I grew up with your music. It brought me happiness whenever I listened to it. Now that I am older and both my parents have passed, your music reminds me of my them and always makes me smile. I'm so very happy that I had been able to see you in concert. You are such a mensch, and I thank you for the music you have given us. I wish you and your family much love on this journey. b'shalom, Sherry Thank you for all the joy that your music, and especially, “Puff” brought to my life and to my daughters’ lives! Your music was our bedtime lullabies— and some of the songs that we sang on the long bus rides to Washington, DC Peace or Welfare Rights Marches! We still sing your songs together as a family. Peace to you! - Karen Hedrick \"Light One Candle\" is always my third Hanukkah blessing. Thank you for restoring the Maccabees to their place in the story. - Laura French Your music was the soundtrack of my youth. I was so thrilled when I was finally able to hear you perform in person when you came to Jerusalem and performed at the YMCA. It was as amazing and I had imagines. Thank you. much for the beautiful and meaningful music. - Judith Sudilovsky As a child I listened to the record puff the magic dragon endlessly - and then something truly awful happened to me and I was suddenly terrified of the dark. My parents bought me my own record player for my room and a special nightlight and they would let it run all night if I wanted. It still makes me feel safe when I hear it. I’m still afraid of the dark - but I have a son named Jackie who I protect Thank you so so much for this and just being on this planet while I was too. XOX - Kimberly Goebel I’m very sad to hear about Peter’s failing health. He had touched me in a very sad time in my life when my older brother who was 56 years old at the time and a very accomplished Pediatric Cardiologist contracted Pancreatic Cancer. He loved PP&M and we played their songs for my brother which helped ease his pain. As a tribute to him and his very special accomplished life and career, I ended his eulogy in front of over 1000 people with Light One Candle, because now 20years later his light still shines. I wish Peter, a peaceful passing and maybe he and Mary will meet my brother and sing Light One Candle to him. ​ - Keith Boxer Peter, we've never met but your voice and musical heart has been part of my life since before I can remember. I was born in the late 1960s and thanks to my parents, schools and camps, your songs filled my world with love, hope and peace. Little did I realize how meaningful they would be to me in my late 50s! Now when the world seems a scarier, troubling place - your life's work reminds me there is hope. There will always be hope, and light. I hope you feel the love you have given to us all, coming back to you and surrounding you on this journey. Thank you. Bless you. ~Cheryl I will never forget meeting you at the Cinema Arts Centre. You performed and we were able to buy a beautiful Coffee Table Book. I told you that when I was a public school teacher at St. Mary's Hospital for Children in Bayside, NY I was asked to play the music for their annual Holiday Performance. The students performed various dances and songs. Because the Nativity was the final presentation and there was no time for costume changes, the students did the Hora dressed as Mary, Joseph, etc. The highlight of the presentation was the song \"Light One Candle.\" The students were awed by it and the response was amazing. Thank you for helping me enrich the lives of these students and the entire hospital. I used your music repeatedly as a teaching tool. I also personally benefitted by attending your concerts and filling out home with your music. You will never be forgotten and I thank you for that and for everything. May you find comfort in words such as these and the love you get from family, friends, colleagues and fans like me. ​ - Barbara Tetenbaum Dear Peter, You have been such a vital part of my life since childhood. At the ages of around five to seven, this would have been between 1967 and the first part of 1969, I would go to my best friend's house and she would play your album for me. We must have played \"Lemon Tree\" the most often as that is the one I remember. I also remember my music teacher discussing \"Puff, the Magic Dragon\" in class. For a long time I didn't have access to this music, but in college I started buying the LPs. A friend who is a recording engineer transferred them to cassette tape so I could play them as often as I liked. Sometimes the music makes me cry but in a good way. I like to have it playing when doing any task. My mom, who passed away this year, particularly liked \"Cruel War.\" My sisters love you too. Later when I had a CD player I bought the CDs. I also caught every TV appearance I could, including The Jack Benny Show and concerts. Thank you so much for your wonderful music. Cornelia Shields To our beloved uncle Peter I remember telling people from a very young age that you were my uncle Peter but couldn’t understand how we were connected. Only later in life did I know that there are people so special who can touch you and your family without being blood, and you were most certainly one of them. You have been part of every great milestone for our family. Through bnai mitzvah weddings and births - your presence and blessings enhance the memories of each of these moments. One of my greatest joys was introducing you to my son eitan last pesach. It meant so much to me and my dad to see you singing to my son the way you sang to me at about the same age. He is two now and he loves playing guitar and all music. Seeing the world through his eyes has changed my life for the better. It’s allowed me to appreciate every sound and site and the people that are part my family - the family by birth and by choice. This past year in israel has not been the easiest and I find myself thinking about how you - someone who fought tirelessly for peace and equality would maneuver through such challenging times. Amidst it all I try to continue to fight for those who need a voice, just as you exemplified. Thank you for being our uncle Peter and for bringing your light into this world. May it continue to shine through those you have touched. Shira Kleinman Deeply sadend to hear you are in such poor health Peter! Last week I sent you a physical Xmas card and now I was checking your website to see it you happened to perform anywhere in New York around New Year and then saw this very sad \"news\", about your health and this living tribute page. Of course I want to write something. I have interviewed you twice for national Swedish Radio (both as part of programs aired on Christmas), 2019 and 2022 I believe it was. Thank you som much for that Peter! It was such an honor and such a pleasure to meet you, and talk to and hear your thoughts. On our first meeting you talked about the protest songs against school schootings. Songs you had just written together with school kids, in Florida. My first encounter with PP&M was in the summer of 1987 when Swedish Television showed a PP&M concert (25th anniversary) and I as a 12 year-old watched together with my sister, father and grandfather. We all enjoyed it so much! And soon after my dad bought a record of PP&M, \"greatest hits\". We have bought many PP&M-records since then. In 1992 I was a foreign ex-change student at an American high school in Washington State. On Christmas Eve when we had dinner with my host family, at my host-mom's sister's place in Olympia, I asked kindly if perhaps we could have the TV on in the background \"because there is gonna be Peter, Paul & Mary Xmas concert on\". Of course we could! They were delighted and it turned out that my host mother's sister and her husband (both school teachers at the time, living in Olympia, Washington) turned out to be real PP&M-fans. So we watched the Xmas concert on TV while eating. This was Xmas Eve 1992. The day after they showed me many video tapes of PP&M that they had at home an told me that every time PP&M were performing near Seattle or Portland thet went to see them. They were all very surprised (but delighted at the same time) that a 17-year old boy from Sweden even knew about Peter Paul & Mary, and even more so that he (I that is) was a fan! In the following spring (1993) PBS showed \"Peter Paul & Mommy too\", and we watched and I later bought that video tape. Anyway, dear Peter, I have loved your work! And have the highest respect and sympathy for your as a person. Please get better! It was such a pleasure visiting your wonderful home on upper west side on Manhattan, a couple of years ago, and have a talk with you for Swedish Radio (which I do occasional work for). ​ - Gustaf Larsson At 19, I was in awe in the audience of a PPM concert in New Orleans. It was 1967. Peter and Paul sang with a small group of adoring fans that night for hours. We laughed, talked, sang and made an incredible cadre of memories. Peter and I met up again in New Orleans. How surprised I was that he remembered that evening. He looked me the eye, both hands on my shoulders and said he had a strange feeling that we had sung together before. We met up again and again in New Orleans and sang each time. The last time I saw Peter was on the Covid-19 YouTube mini concerts. He comforted me when my husband died of Covid that March through nights of music and gratitude for lives well-lived. I think of him often, Bethany, and feel your pain. May the profound act of leaving this world be eased by knowing he truly made a difference. I love you. Peter. You are ageless, timeless. I will never forget the moments of connection through music and Judaism that we shared. ​ - Janie Schexnayders-Soslow I have loved the music of Peter, Paul, & Mary since the summer of1964 when my cousin Annette introduced me to \"Blowing in the Wind\"! I was just short of my 12th birthday. Guess what I asked for & recieved for my birthday in August? A \"stereo\" for my room & the 1st 3 albums!!! After that my babysitting money went towards P,P,& M records as well as other folk music. Peter, your voice has gotten me thru all kinds of family tragedies & joys. Please know that if I could take your pain away, would! I saw you in concert several times in San Diego at SDSU Open air Theatre, & other venues. My husband understood my obsession! My kids grew up surrounded by Peter, Paul, & Mary! I could go on & on...but I won't... please know that I love you from a far & be comforted. ​ - Cecile Fleetwood Dear Peter, I have loved your music and PP&M since I was a young girl with two older brothers always playing your records. We strummed our guitars and sang your beautiful songs. What a joy… Fast forward to the night I was making calls for Obama’s election in a Manhattan restaurant…I looked up, and there you were— you chatted with the few of us gathered around, gave words of encouragement, and then took out your guitar and began playing Blowin’ in the Wind. There I stood, in tears, swaying and singing that song with you. What a joy. Thank you for your warm hug and words of hope. Thank you for a special moment I will never forget. Thank you for your music. What a joy. I wish you peace… Nancy Siporin Tikkun Olam About 1 year ago a dear friend, Michael Jones, who I had not seen since covid was coming to NYC to visit Peter; Peter is the godfather to his 2 children; Mike and I planned to meet up for dinner after he visited Peter; Peter happened to live a 10 minute walk from my apartment and Michael insisted that I stop at Peter's before dinner; so I did. Upon meeting Peter I felt an instant connection; unbeknownst to me Michael had told Peter a bit about what my life's work has been; upon meeting Peter he said in a comical yiddish accent \"So you're the lawyer . . . your parents must be proud of you . . .\" He then asked what I actually do and I explained that I am a civil rights lawyer and I work with people in the South Bronx who are wrongfully accused, arrested and/or convicted of crimes. Peter immediately smiled at me and said \"Tikkun Olam\". I was completely blown away and realized that this 80 plus year old legend actually understood me - my beliefs - my life's work - in an instant (the only other person who understands me is the love of my life - my wife Ann); nobody has ever described what I do as Tikkun Olam; I felt an instant connection - a warmth - and a special kinship to Peter with such kind and meaningful words; for those of you who do not know - Tikkun Olam - is a Hebrew phrase that means \"repairing the world\"; it describes actions a person takes in helping others to make the world a better and kinder place. As it turns out we all went out to dinner at a NYC institution - Carmines; before leaving Peter's apartment for Carmines I said in a low voice to Michael - \"let me call an Uber to take us there\"; Peter heard what I said and his response: \"I have all these metro cards - let's take the subway!\" So, we took the train to 42nd Street! My wife (a huge fan of Peter's) joined us and the night was filled with laughter, talk of history and music and every subject under the sun. At one point as Peter was talking to my wife Ann - he asked all about her and if we had children - Ann looked at me and I looked at her - Ann took out her phone and said yes - here is a picture of our child (our black lab puppy); there was silence for a second and then Peter's response - \"was it a difficult birth . . .?\" Everybody at the table fell on the floor in laughter! Again - an instant connection; when it was time to go Peter insisted on taking the subway; however, we all convinced him to hop in a cab and Ann and I took him home. The ride home was full of laughter and to our delight, Peter was singing! Upon reaching his home - Peter - in the most sincere and loving way - hugged both myself and Ann and said \"Zei Gezunt\" (stay healthy/go in health); So with that said, Peter - thank you for all you have done for mankind - for world peace - for social justice - for civil rights - for creating beautiful music and art - and for making a surreal and special moment for two fellow native New Yorkers - we wish you peace and thank you for making the world a better, more decent, and loving place - Tikkun Olam, Peter. - Neil Wollerstein I can see by reading all of these beautiful tributes, that we were not the only ones that became instantly spellbound upon meeting you. We had so much fun that evening! Your wit and charm - and extraordinary empathy and kindness - are as legendary as your music and social activism. It was one of the greatest moments of our lives to meet you. Thank you for being you - and giving us so much. You are a beautiful soul, and we adore you. The picture we posted, taken at the end of our dinner, is just one of the memories from that evening that will last a lifetime.... smiling faces, strawberry shortcake and sangria. - Ann Turetsky Wollerstein In the early 1980s, my father-in-law had tickets to see Peter, Paul, and Mary perform in Pittsburgh, PA. He had made a contribution that gave him access to the performers at a pre-show reception. But he was ill on the day of the concert, so he gave his tickets to my wife and me. We were in our early-mid-twenties and had been big fans since childhood and were also peace activists. So it was exciting to get to meet our heroes. I am a songwriter and had written a Christmas song, which my wife loved. At some point during the reception, I lost track of her but then saw her coming across the room excitedly. She told me she had cornered Peter, told him about my song and had even sung him a highly sped-up version of it. She said he was very gracious and told her that he wasn’t able to help but pointed her in the direction of publishers. I was mortified but, of course amazed and pleased that my wife would do such a thing. And I have a second story with a touching encounter with Peter. About thirty years had passed. My wife had sort of gone the way of Little Jackie Paper, in that we grew apart. (We are now very good friends, co-parents and co-grandparents.). But love found me again, and my sweetheart and I went to hear Peter perform at Slippery Rock University in western Pennsylvania in 2011 or 2012. He was working in support of intellectually disabled students. My sweetheart and I were sitting in a sizable crowd, but at some point we moved to the back seats of the auditorium. We sat there alone so we could put our heads close to each other and harmonize with Peter and each other. It felt like the three of us were the only people in the room as we sang together. Following the show, Peter was signing merch, so we got to shake his hand and tell him how important he was in our lives. Please give him my love and my prayers for a peaceful passing, with a minimum of pain and a maximum of family to see him through. ​ - Peter Donovan I grew up in the same apartment building on 86th street as Peter's mother Vera. My mom became her friend and Vera sometimes joined us for holiday dinners with our extended family, where she would get into political arguments with a right-wing ophthalmologist cousin of ours. She was inspirational to me with her feistiness, her progressive politics, and the way she continued to dive into life in \"old age\" (she was probably in her 70s then, not so old!, but to my teenage self, ancient) such as her trips to the exotic destination of Berkeley. All of that was light years distant from my own apolitical, conventional upper east side family. Born in 1958, I was just a toddler when Peter was making hits with PP&M. I came to know his music with his solo album Peter, which came out when I was in high school or maybe early college. I played that over and over, so many times, and the songs are embedded in my brain. When I am in need of uplift, I still hum Weave Me the Sunshine. I still take inspiration from Don't Ever Take Away My Freedom. And as climate change and other economic stresses cause fissures in our world, I think back to his lines \"if we do these things in the green wood, what will happen in the dry?\" It gave me shivers when I was 17 and it gives me even darker shivers now. I now live in Oakland, California, where over the past year I helped start a committee within our synagogue called Coexist -- those of us who needed, as Jews, to express dissension over the Gaza war and reinforce a vision of a peaceful middle east with self-determination and a thriving future for both Palestinians and Israelis. Last night we had a Chanukah party and as we lit candles expressing our yearning for peace and justice, we of course sang Light One Candle. So Peter was with us in music and spirit, even if he didn't know it -- as he is with some many others through his music and his values. I send my deepest love and gratitude to Peter, and my thoughts are with you who are close to him. He has been a blessing to our world. P.S. I did babysit one time for his kids in their apartment on the east side. But (LOL) I don't remember anything about it! ​ - Ilana DeBare So, so many memories. One of my husband's and my first dates was a Peter, Paul and Mary concert on the Boston Common. It was SO loud! They credited every song they sang, except Light One Candle. I didn't know that Peter had written it! We used Light One Candle at the havdalah for our wedding. We took youth groupers to DC where they held the banner at the Jefferson Memorial for Peter and Mary. (And I sobbed through Carry On Sweet Survivor.) A class sang it on Channel 9 WMUR NH. Too many concerts through the years. Lots of outdoor concerts in Massachusetts and NH. A concert in Andover, with Peter and Bethany. Perhaps you would even call us groupies. The last time I saw him was at Elgin Community College event where I was up on stage with him singing Puff. I own the pop up book, a signed copy to my daughter. I just reread it. Of course, this week I sang it as a solo as part of our Hanukkah celebrations. Peter, Paul and Mary provided the sound track of our lives. Don't worry. The light won't go out. - Rabbi Margaret Frisch Klein One of my favorite memories about Peter took place on a small island off the coast of British Columbia, where a group of philanthropists were gathered, raising money for Threshold Foundation, to be given away to good causes. Peter stood up, played a song, and offered to fly anywhere in the world and to play for free for a private fundraiser to support whatever good cause the winner of the auction chose. The payment, of course, was not to him, but to the foundation. And because he would then play at a separate fundraiser, the gift would keep on giving. The bids began, rose to the tens of thousands of dollars, with three or four bidders competing against each other for Peter’s prize. Finally, when one of them “won“ Peter spoke to the three who “lost”, and offered to play fundraisers for their causes also, if they matched the winning bid, which they all did. So the giving and gifting went on and on and on. He played music of course, and also played with the crowd so masterfully, for the sake of the many greater goods. A master class in skillful generosity. ​ - Jim Gollin Dear Peter, We first met when you were performing with Paul and Mary somewhere in the midwest and I was attending a conference of the National Association of College Admissions Counselors. Through my dear friend, Anne Ferguson, whom you had met that day, we met that evening. In the 30+ years since, our paths have crossed many times...and each time, I am so struck by your generosity. You shared your talents at at least two NACAC national meetings, inspiring all of us to do our best in the profession of education. In fact, several of us were so touched by your words and spirit that we traveled to NYC in subsequent years to hear you at Lincoln Center. You willingly shared your talents with your Cornell classmates on more than one occasion, reminding them and teaching others of the joy of Rompin' and Stompin' back in the day! A class of 1959 reunion always seemed less when you were not there. When Cornell was having a campaign to raise funds for scholarships, you opened your home in NYC for us to sponsor an event; our responses went through the roof. One of my treasured memories is you leading those assembled (from current students to wizened trustees) in 'If I Had a Hammer'...everyone was moved. And then there were my family's visits to NYC to see you perform and afterwards, we joined you at Cafe des Artistes for brunch; again, you were so generous and kind with your time and your attention. And finally, your performance at the Hangar Theater in Ithaca just a couple of years ago gave me the chance to see you again, introduce you to my new husband, and be reminded of all the love you have shared throughout your life. Your talent, your passion, your commitment, your generosity and your spirit have inspired generations...and more people than you ever will know. I count myself so fortunate for being among those whose lives you have touched. Thank you for being you. May you find peace and comfort in the days ahead. Always, Susan Murphy Vice President Emerita Cornell University and a friend The \"Blowin' in the Wind\" album was my gift on my birthday as a new teen. The songs Stewball and more prompted me to (a) love folk music, (b) feel compassion for others' suffering, (c) get an acoustic guitar and teach myself how to play -- with your songs first in my repertoire. I arrived on Bleeker and MacDougall Streets in 1965 and apparently you 3 had just moved on from those cafes. I always caught your concerts on PBS -- with your harmonies coursing through me and nurturing me. Your song, \"Light One Candle\" let me know you are still the beautiful being who engaged me so many decades earlier. I worked very briefly with your bandmate, Noel, and he spoke so highly of you always. Please don't let your light go out. I wish you an easy transition and, if it pleases you, a speedy return. We need your heart, your music, your love now more than ever. I'm only sorry I didn't ever get to tell you in person. By the way, my Temple, Congregation Kol Ami in West Hollywood, sang \"Light One Candle\" the other night for Shabbanukah. So much love to you. Lynn from Coney Island/Brighton Beach and later Burbank California. - Lynn (nee Wolfson) Harrill Peter, Thank you for your life's work. At 10 years old, PP&M's first album inspired me to learn to play the guitar and generate the courage to sing to audiences large and small which I've continued to do for the past 63 years. \"In the Wind\" is still my favorite album and \"All My Trials, Lord\" and \"Don't Think Twice\" my two favorite songs from that album. The Martin guitar my mother gave me in support of my efforts was initially chosen by Noel Paul Stookey for an adult friend of mine in 1968. So, how ever briefly he or both of you touched the guitar, I feel like you're with me for as long as I'm alive. Ever grateful for your vision, courage, resilience, and music , Wishing you great strength in the days ahead, Nick I cannot imagine my musical life without the profound influence of PPM, modeling music as activism since the time I was a teen. I followed in their footsteps, singing at rallies for Soviet Jews in the early 1970's, and knowing that Peter was so proud of the way he openly blended his Jewish values with his American song gifts. I have taught \"Light One Candle\" to generations of children and families, and learned almost every song that PPM sang, by heart. He used his remarkable musical gifts to create SO much courage, hope and healing. We will continue to sing the songs that he taught us until justice reigns and hope is restored. Family, thank you for giving us an opportunity to acknowledge him -- and also to thank you for the countless ways in which you shared him with the world. ​ - Riki Lippitz This past year, I had the tremendous privilege of getting to sing with Peter, on his songs, in Baton Rouge, at the Red Dragon. I had sat in on fiddle with him and Christopher once before at that same venue--in 2015 or 2016, I think it was--but this time, I was singing Peter, Paul, and Mary songs that I grew up learning, back in the 70s, when doing so wasn't as fashionable as it had been a decade or so before. We sang songs from one particular PPM album I had back then, namely In the Wind, and yes, we sang the Dylan classic title song. I think I mainly sang harmony on most everything, but I sang lead on a verse or two. The connection with the audience was palpable. They were all singing along. And I thought I was just there to open for him. He was very kind and generous. Getting to sing with Peter was a great honor and a tremendous if unexpected pleasure. ​ - Gina Forsyth Like so many others, i grew up with Peter's voice and Peter's songs on the record player. My mom often took my brother and me, and sometimes my great-aunts Sophie and Slava, to Peter Paul and Mary reunion concerts After one of those shows, sometime in the early 1980's, we walked over, introduced ourselves to Peter, and stood there talking for a while. Decades later, in 2016, I was living in Jerusalem, working with musicians and other artists to amplify voices of mutual recognition and respect, justice and peace. On a trip back to New York, I was walking in Central Park when my phone rang. It was Peter calling me in response to an e-mail I had written him. He wanted to hear more about what I was trying to do. He invited me to his apartment. We sat and talked. He listened. And unlike anybody else, he gave me an immediate and enthusiastic yes. That yes, that willingness to contribute his music, his wisdom and experience, was such a blessing, such a kindness, such a gift. What Peter did was uncommon and precious in ways that one cannot calculate. That June, Peter flew from a concert inTexas to New York and then to Tel Aviv. You took a taxi from the airport to Mitzpe Ramon, a town in the Negev desert, just in time for breakfast. You were a day late and I was struggling. A loud portion of the younger musicians saw our time together as a chance to just hang out and have fun. Peter, you and I sat over breakfast. You asked me questions about what was happening and I told him. You listened. Then you said, give me time with them at the beginning of the first meeting this morning. After breakfast, the group of fifty or so of us sat in a circle. We had some time with your friend David Geffen, an Orthodox Jewish educator and his wife. And then you, Peter spoke about the power of music. You spoke about your experiences in the Civil Rights Movement. You spoke about singing before Martin Luther King gave his famous speech, \"I Have a Dream.\" Then you picked up his guitar and started strumming. You asked everybody to stand up and join you in a circle. You led us in singing \"We Shall Overcome.\" Before I knew it, we in that room, were singing together and holding hands. The moment caught us by surprise:I could see the surprise, then the letting go and the joy, in our faces. After the song, Saz, a Palestinian hip-hop artist turned to me. \"Who the fuck is that man?\" he asked. In a moment, our group of wonderfully talented individuals became a group of artists in the desert for a purpose. What you, Peter, did, did that morning shifted our group in powerful ways that reverberated throughout that five day retreat and into the next year. I think that Saz and Sun Tailor were inspired by you, Peter, to write what became their wake up song. I remember that you wrote a song based on conversations with Micah Hendler, who was at that retreat. You and some of the musicians from that retreat, including Sun and Saz, Micah, and Mira Awad, along with David Broza and Achinoam Nini, played \"The Composing For Peace Concert\" in May 2018 at The Streicker Center in New York. I have more memories of you, Peter, from that retreat that I'll go deeper into another time. For now, I'll just say that by showing up, by listening, by being present, by sharing what he shared, Peter transformed things. Peter, you gave us a gift. From what I know, that gift is one of far too many to count that you have given to so many of us, and to this world. And you at the Streicker Center--that was beautiful. Thank you, Peter, for what kept you awake and ready to answer a call from somebody who asked you to go the desert. Thank you for your abiding commitment to justice, your abiding commitment to the power of music in social transformation, for your songs, and for your love. I hear your voice, Peter, even now as if we were sitting together across the table. I know that your gifts will reverberate far into the future. Thank you. ​ - Daniel Noah Moses My parents (just a few years younger than Peter) were/are huge folk music fans, and when I was young (b.1968), Peter Paul & Mommy was on repeat in my home. My dad would sing the boa constrictor song, day is done, Going to the Zoo non-stop. We went to see them in concert at Wolf Trap several times. When he wrote and performed Light One Candle it was like I felt being Jewish wasn’t just something personal, or what we did in synagogue - but it was part of folk music culture too! I always felt close to Peter because my parents have a friend named Peter who was always the spiting image of Peter Yarrow. I want to just also say that when he sang Day is Done as part of Craig Taubman’s video collection for the Jewish High Holy Days in 2020, as a rabbi, I included that video in particular at the close of Yom Kippur. I wish him a transition of love and light - and his impact on me and on the world will never be forgotten. ​ - Yael Ridberg Dear Peter, Thank you for bringing light and music into my life for many years. I listened to you (Paul and Mary) as a teenager and bought your records. I taught and sang your songs to my first grade students when I was in my twenties. I had my own children in my thirties and sang your songs with them when they were children. I saw you in person when you performed at a synogogue in my home town in San Diego and was inspired to support Operation Respect. I am now in my seventies with an infant grandson (my first). I have been singing Puff the Magic Dragon to my grandson each time I hold him. I bought him a Puff the Magic Dragon board book and will give it to him tonight. You made a difference in my life, the lives of my students, my children, my grandson and so many others. Thank you for touching my life in so many ways. The world is a better and more beautiful place because of you. Love, Sandie Peter…our lives have intertwined many times over the years. Long before we even met I was a high school classmate of Lenny Lipton who of course so impacted your life when he shared his poem about “Puff The Magic Dragon” with you in college which you then created this most memorable song. We finally did meet in the 60’s when I worked at Channel 4 TV on a documentary show for “New York Illustrated” devoted to capturing the phenomenon that was Peter, Paul and Mary. Again years went by and then we were “breaking bread” with our mutual friends Suzanne Somers and Alan Hamel at that little Czech restaurant on Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles. I’m sorry to hear that you are ailing now but I want to add my name to all your other friends, family and countless fans who have been so touched by your talent and activism through the years. ​ - Howard Papush Mr. Yarrow, I don't even know where to begin, but I think the best place is with a sincere \"thank you.\" Your music has touched my life in ways that I cannot put into words. My first concert at a kid was to see Peter, Paul, and Mary, and I grew up on a rich feed of your powerful, empowering lyrics and unbelievable harmonies. While my classmates were listening to boy bands and pop stars, I was listening to the folk rock of the 60s and 70s, and I never stopped. My Sunday mornings are filled with the joy of growing a garden, the pain of losing childhood fantasy, the call to stand up for the rights of my neighbors. Thank you, sir. Thank you for taking me to the zoo. Thank you for taking me on a 500 mile train ride in the early morning rain. Thank you for reminding me not to let the light go out. ​ - Justine Armentrout Hi, my name is Mary-Ellen and I come from Fairhaven Massachusetts, I’m 68 years old. As a little girl, I listened to my older sister and brothers albums. Peter, Paul & Mary’s was among them…I believe it was your first album. I was seven or eight at the time when I started listening to it. It was one of my favorites… I listened to If I had a hammer, Lemon tree, 500 miles and Where have the flowers gone over and over… I absolutely fell in love with this album my first really!! Tried as I might I sang along and memorized the words to these songs and have never forgotten them. Your music is beautiful. The harmonies you all sang made me happy and smile. Peter, Although I never got the chance to see you live, your music will always be a memory of my childhood and of happier times. Your music will be loved forever and never forgotten… Peace and love to you… Mary-Ellen Shervo Dear Bethany, What a beautiful idea for a living tribute!! Dear Peter, You will not remember me, but I often think of you with gratitude. In college, my roommate had a record of Peter, Paul and Mary which she always played at nighttime. Although I had heard your songs on the radio, it was through her that I was introduced to more of your music and one of your fans– around 1976. My daughter was only in St. Anne’s for 1 year, but it was at that time around 1991, that due to my involvement with the anti-nuclear movement, I got to meet you as you graciously hosted a fundraiser in your apartment. Several years ago, when the Walkabout Clearwater chorus was part of a recording session in NYC, you invited us to your home afterwards and gifted us a copy of Day is Done. It is one of my favorite songs, and I will always treasure that book. I also remember your contribution to the panel discussion in 2023 when we were celebrating with the Waterfall Unity Alliance the return of land in the Schoharie Valley. I decided to attend the event after Bethany performed at our Buttonhook Forest fundraiser. You have been a role model of an active elder: fit, energetic, giving of your time to all you come in contact. Through music, your projects, and with joy, you have helped in so many ways to create the just, life enhancing world we want to live in. My thoughts are with you, Bethany, and the rest of your family. I feel forever grateful that I was able to meet you. The memory of your dedication, smile, love of people and work for justice will live with me always. Laurie Evans In addition to listening to ALL of PPM’s albums and memorizing them, I was fortunate enough to hear them in person 3 times in three states. The first time was in the late 60’s at the University of Texas. After the concert, the three of them allowed many attendees to come backstage. They divided themselves 3 ways, each with a group of awestruck college students literally sitting at their feet. I was on Peter’s group and was so impressed then by both his gentleness and his passion as he spoke of the need for world peace and for peaceful protest as a way to help get us out of Vietnam Nam. Later that year (and after the Kent State tragedy) I volunteered to be a peace Marshall at an anti-war protest there in Austin. I don’t think I would have had the courage except for his words and inspiration. Thank you, Peter Yarrow, for your gifts of song and inspiration. ​ - Marty W Nearly midnight in Plattsburgh. You were at our house having dinner after your concert at the Strand Theatre. I showed you that I still had the toy guitar that you signed for me when I was five years old, and then again at your solo performance in Saranac Lake when we sang together. And suddenly, we all realized what time it was getting to be, and my parents and I drove you across the lake to Burlington, because you were flying out the next morning to sing at a rally in Oregon. We got to your hotel around 2 a.m. A bleary-eyed hotel clerk inexplicably asked you if your reservation was for that night or another night. So many memories to go alongside that one. Meeting you for the first time when I was five years old. Lunch with you in Saratoga last December. Time spent backstage with you and Robert De Cormier in Rutland, Vermont. Several chats at Proctors Theatre in Schenectady. Your first concert after the pandemic at the Katharine Hepburn Center in Connecticut. You introduced me to one of your friends as an advocate that night. I have never been prouder or more honored than I was in that moment. And so many times in between -- times when we were not together in person, but when you were with me front-and-center in my life. Times when I needed to stand up for justice and for humanity when others were ignoring those principles. Times when I could sing the type of music that you taught me speaks louder than words. Times when the road ahead seemed unclear until I heard in my mind your voice, speaking or singing, calmly ushering me onto the path. For as long as I live, you will be with me. Each time I sing, your voice will be a part of me. Each time I advocate for justice in our world, your teachings and your wisdom will guide me. You have blessed my life with your mentorship and your friendship, your music and your light. These things will last always. Our world is better because of you. There will always be a hammer of justice and a bell of freedom and a song about love. There will always be a magic dragon who defies the odds and comes back at the end to still live by the sea. The light will never go out. ​ - Benjamin Pomerance I can’t begin to tell you the impact that Peter, Paul & Mary have had over my life the last 43 years. As a child of the 80’s I first was introduced to your brilliance from the PBS special. Fast forward to the 2010’s when I became more socially aware and rediscovered your music. I don’t even know what to say at this time but I guess I just want to say how much you and your music mean to me on a cellular level. This world is so cruel and seemingly increasingly evil, yet it calms me to know people exist like you, who dedicated your life to making the world better. Your music brings peace to me and I hope the great spirit in the sky brings YOU peace and comfort when you most need it. I have nothing but love for you and send my positive healing energy to you when you most need it. Bless you Peter and thank you for the decades of your musical brilliance, you have accomplished something most humans will never achieve, immortality through your art! ​ - Nathaniel Nahler A while back, I had the privilege of seeing my childhood folk heroes, Peter, Paul & Mary, perform on the campus at Stanford University. I had brought a stuffed dragon with me to cuddle while singing \"Puff,\" and at the end of the song I held him up -- and was acknowledged from the stage! Through various, unexpected circumstances, my husband and I wound up with backstage passes. Mary was becoming too ill for meet-and-greets, but Paul and Peter came out. The moment he emerged from the door, Peter made a beeline for me and engulfed me in a hug that I maintain to this day radiated all the way from his heart. He and Paul signed my dragon, and Peter talked me me for a bit before starting to sign sheet music for kids and spreading his love around the entire room. That hug remains with me all these years later every time I think of PP&M. Thank you, Peter, for the music, the hug ... and the love. Always. ​ - Sharon Cathcart I wrote for a woman Janice Wolf, who takes in abused animals, after treatment and recovery most of them are rehomed. Ever wonder how Ms. Janice got her start in animal rescue . . . here's what I think. Everyone knows Ms. Janice and animals in need seem to find one another. And not just dogs and cats but, zebras, capybaras, goats, horses, and birds of all feathers. You can honestly say that any animal in need, can find refuge and care in her heart. Now, Ms. Janice has been saving animals in need ever since she was a young girl. It all started one day when a very young Ms. Janice was walking through a land called Honalee and she stumbled upon an abandoned dragon who went by the name of Puff. And not just any ole’ dragon but, a magic dragon no less. Puff had been left alone, to care for himself. His human, a young boy, who went by the name of Jackie Paper grew up and just left Puff, to be on his own. Janice, heard the sound of crying and when she investigated found Puff crying like there was no tomorrow and she got totally soaked in a magic dragon tear storm. Not many people are aware of this mystical fact, but any human getting wet in a magic dragon tear storm are forever changed. They have that proverbial “veil” lifted or washed away from their eyes and they see more than the average person could ever hope to see. But, Puff was so depressed, he just ignored young Janice. Fortunately for Janice she had in her possession, three cheese, bean, chili burrito’s, just dripping with spicy jalapeno hot sauce. And friend . . . there is no comparison between strings and sealing wax, not when you’re carrying three hot burritos smothered in jalapenos in your Scooby Doo lunch pail, remember we’re talking about a dragon. After Puffs first bite, the tears stopped and his first words were “More . . .” and then, “Jackie . . . who?” And so . . . started Janice’s career. (little known fact, but almost all of the dragons in the modern world have lost their ability to fly because of burrito’s, they’ve gotten too fat. Also, never, ever stand behind a dragon who has recently eaten a burrito, instead of breathing fire . . . things just sort of go “backwards”.) Ms. Janice still has Puff, and he keeps an eye on the herd of unicorns, she keeps on the RRR just over the creek, past the waterfall and up and behind the hill, where the “dream trees” grow. Anyone who falls asleep in that particular grove of dream trees will have nothing but good, powerful, fantastic dreams. But, that’s another story. ​ - Perry Kuntz To my dearest Uncle Peter, Thank you for being a part of my life. For as long as I can remember, back from being sang to sleep as a toddler at PP&M concerts late at night, to seders in recent years, you have always been present and encouraging those around you and I’m fortunate to be one of those people. Beginning with the Q&A portion of my bar mitzvah before you sang, you have challenged me to seek out justice, stand up for what is right and what I believe in. That has gotten me through vet school and now I can advocate for animals, I can give a voice to the voiceless population that means that most to me. I will always stand up for what I believe, give a speak up for those who can’t, and never stop learning and in large part I have you to thank for that. I also want to thank you for some of my fondest memories. I remember as a child you brought Shira and I on stage somewhere to sing Puff with you and it was my first time in front of a crowd, and you helped us through. I also recall in late high school when my dad finally determined I was old enough to hang out after a show, we went to a restaurant and the young host asked about the concert we had just come from. Your response to his asking how you liked PP&M music, you responded “I’m not sure it’s my style” which sent our whole group and the manager who had emerged form the back into a laughing fit. One of my favorite memories from when I was a camper was you coming to perform puff for my unit head after she broke into tears because she had missed your concert at Eisner because that is the thoughtful person you are. You brought music to our seders, a personal touch to our life events, and helped our hearts grow with every interaction. For all of this and more I will love and appreciate you always. -Avi Kleinman Dear Peter, I just learned of your current challenges and of the living tributes that your children are reading to you. I could relay lots of stories, but this is one I don’t think I ever shared with you. As you’ll recall, I performed the premiere concert of The Other Side of Broadway in November of 1998 as part of the Saint Peter’s Church Classical Concert Series. Not only did you attend, but you generously hosted an after-concert reception, for me, the composers, and our special guests, at your home. At that concert, I performed the “Sonata for Cocktail Piano” by David Shire. During my dress rehearsal of that piece, David said that the middle movement (Andante con rubato) needed to be “more Jewish.” Not being Jewish myself, I brought to bear every Jewish influence with which I was familiar for the performance. After the concert, you said to me, “Barbara, that middle movement of David’s sonata really resonated with me.” I took that as glorious confirmation that I had achieved what David asked me to do. Thanks for that, Peter! Sending all my love to you, Barbara I got on Peter's mailing list because my son Scott went to the wonderful Colvig Silver Camps Colorado with Peter’s son Christopher many years ago. Through that relationship I was able to reach and ask Peter to participate in the virtual reunion celebration we created on Zoom two years ago for the 50th anniversary of George McGovern receiving the Democratic nomination for President. Peter, Paul and Mary were a critical soundtrack of my life. I remember first listening to their music when I was 13 and had just gotten my first guitar. When at 16 I had saved enough from mowing lawns and shoveling snow to buy my own component stereo system, I also bought the double album “PPM In Concert” and played it over and over and over again. I saw them perform live several times. I was still a bit awestruck when I talked to Peter in 2022 and he happily agreed to participate. He laughed at my idiocy in working late in the New York campaign headquarters one night in June 1972, and passing up a free ticket to the “Together for McGovern” Madison Square Garden fundraising concert that Warren Beatty and he had organized. The concert reunited Simon and Garfunkel, Nichols and May, and PPM. It was overrun with celebrity ushers. I missed a major highlight of the campaign! Peter remembered that the last time Peter, Paul and Mary sang together was another McGovern event in 2006, celebrating the dedication of the McGovern Library at George and Eleanor McGovern’s alma mater Dakota Wesleyan University. They headlined a concert at the Corn Palace in Mitchell, South Dakota. I was there. A high point was when the trio and McGovern sang his favorite “Freight Train” together. For our campaign reunion, Peter recorded himself on the guitar singing the beginning of “Blowin’ in the Wind” and then had it smoothly transition to a recording of the three of them singing the anthem on stage full blast back in the day. It was so uplifting, a reminder of the power of music in politics and other efforts for social change. Peter and the song were the highlights of our virtual event, deeply appreciated by all of us. Peter's commitment to social change has never waivered, supported by the beauty of his music. Thank you! ​ - David Aylward In my youth I was inspired by the music of Peter, Paul and Mary and especially loved—and still do—your song Day Is Done. I treasure the day our paths crossed in Columbus, Ohio, when David Tamulevich (and Michael Hough?) introduced us before your concert, and together we all unpacked merch before the open air concert on the riverfront downtown. I shall always remember your kindness and graciousness. I have uploaded a photo of you and me taken by my husband just before the show. With love, Teresa Schleifer Dear Peter, I so wish I could tell you this in person. I think often of that evening in Tucson when you invited anyone to join you on stage in singing Puff the Magic Dragon. My husband Bruce and I gathered with the throng and when it was my turn to meet you at the end of the song I quickly told you how I had worked for Gabby Giffords and been shot in the chest during the Tucson shooting. I told you that your music had been a driving force behind so many political movements and we needed music in our fight for gun violence prevention. You took me by the shoulders and said come with me. In your dressing room you showed me the CD that the Parkland kids had been working on with your help. You ignored several calls for you to return to the stage because we had so much to talk about. I met with you again after the show and was so inspried and touched by the efforts you were making to help the Parkland students write out their traumatic experience. I understood so well how the aftermath of a mass shooting affects everyone... a boulder thrown into a pond with ever widenening circles. We had several phone calls after that to talk about how the student's CD could get a wider audience and we connected Gabby to the project. Then there was Covid and you did those wonderful mini concerts from your bedroom at Bethany's house. Do you also remember the zoom fundraiser you put on during those covid days and I ran up the bids for your guitar because I was sure the other guy bidding could give a lot more to the good cause you were supporting. You called me soon afterwards to thank me for helping raise more money. There were two Peters in my life.... the iconic Peter of PPand M ( I met my husband of 56 years at a dorm hootenanny when he was singing your songs) and the Peter I was priviledged to call a gentle, enthusiastic, encouraging, inspirational , warm and nurturing friend. My daughter calls these connections \"blessings of the bullet \" and yes, out of tragedy there are often blessings and getting to know you personally is truly one of those blessings. Peter, you have been a gift to the world and a gift in my life. I promise to continue fighting for a safer country , free from gun violence, and to support the wonderful work on bullying you have nurtured. I send you my love and a huge thank you for how you have touched my life. Love and gentle hugs, Pam Simon I have a letter and contribution for Operation Respect going out in the mail today. I hope Peter gets to see it, because the front of the card has a wondeful picture: of Peter and Me! It was taken July 1996 in Atlanta, GA. PBS had a fund raiser that spring and for a considerable amount (which was a stretch for me) you could get two tickets to their July Atlanta concert...AND dinner with Peter after the show! It was marvellous...at the dinner there were two tables of contributors. Peter divided this time between each table. When he was at your table, he went around one by one asking for our name and something about ourselves. There was no hurry, no rush...and to this day, Peter set the example of truly listening...and I have never felt so listened to before or since. I felt that a part of me had gone into him and a part of him was given back to me. It was a life changing experience...and an experience that I recall often...with much gratitude and love. You never know that impact you have on another...and Peter certainly continues to have a big impact on me, how I listen...and a reminder that often what seems like a little act of kindness, when done with sincerity , can ripple down thru the generations. Thank you for being exactly who you are Peter, thank you for your wondeful music, your humanity, and for being a forever part of my life. ​ - Diana Dokken © 2016 Peter Yarrow - All Rights Reserved ​",

                "content": "Folk singer Peter Yarrow, best known as a member of the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, has died at 86. His publicist confirmed Yarrow died Tuesday morning, surrounded by his family at his home in New York City, after a four-year battle with bladder cancer. The son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, Peter Yarrow grew up in New York City. He began performing folk music as an undergrad at Cornell, and met his bandmates Mary Travers and Noel Paul Stookey in the Greenwich Village folk scene. As Peter, Paul and Mary, the three saw enormous success in the early 1960s, spurred on by a song Yarrow co-wrote, \"Puff, the Magic Dragon.\" The group would notch six Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 between 1962 and 1969, and earn five Grammy awards. Yarrow was a political activist throughout his life, and wrote the anti-Vietnam War protest song \"Day Is Done,\" released by Peter, Paul and Mary in 1969. But in 1970, his reputation was tarnished after he was convicted for a sexual offense against a minor. He served three months in prison and was ultimately pardoned by President Jimmy Carter.

                "content": "Peter Yarrow ’59 performs in Bailey Hall at Reunion 2019. Musician Peter Yarrow ’59, who drew early inspiration from his time at Cornell before joining the legendary folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary, died Jan. 7 in Manhattan. He was 86. In 1961, Yarrow teamed with Mary Travers and Noel Paul Stookey to form one of the most popular folk acts of the 1960s. They would go on to place six songs and five albums in the Billboard’s top 10, with two albums reaching No. 1. Yarrow wrote or co-wrote iconic songs including “Puff the Magic Dragon” – co-written while still at Cornell, and with lyrics based on a poem by Leonard Lipton ’62.. Yarrow majored in psychology in the College of Arts and Sciences and cited as inspiration American Folk Literature, a course nicknamed Romp-n-Stomp, taught by professor and folklorist Harold Thompson. Yarrow served as a student instructor for the class, where he was paid a stipend of $500 – which at the time was 20% of his Cornell tuition, he said – to lead students in songs related to the course content. This included murder and Dust Bowl ballads, and spirituals sung by enslaved peoples. “If you take what I learned in Romp-n-Stomp and look at Peter, Paul and Mary in the march on Washington in 1963, singing ‘Blowin’ in the Wind’ and ‘If I Had a Hammer,’ it was just an extrapolation from Romp-n-Stomp,’” Yarrow later said. Yarrow returned to Cornell for his 50th reunion in 2009 to take part in a Romp-n-Stomp revival, playing with other alumni musicians and leading more than 900 people in song in Bailey Hall. He returned to perform at his 60th reunion in 2019. Cornell was “a place where I felt comfortable,” Yarrow said. Peter Yarrow was born May 31, 1938, in Manhattan to Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. He attended the High School of Music and Art (now the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts) in Manhattan, where he studied painting, and took up playing and performing music while at Cornell. After graduation, he moved back to New York City and began to make a name for himself in the Greenwich Village folk scene. He connected with Albert Grossman, a founder of the Newport Folk Festival, who set him up with Travers and Stookey. In 1961, the newly formed trio of Peter, Paul and Mary released their first album under Warner Bros. Records. The self-titled album went on to reach No. 1 on the Billboard charts and sell more than 2 million copies. In the next nine years, the group released eight more albums, with 12 songs reaching Billboard’s top 40. The group was overtly progressive in its politics, and remade Bob Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind” into a civil rights anthem when they sang it on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, at the site of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. Later, they performed for presidential campaigns and at marches to protest the Vietnam War. After the band split in 1970, Yarrow released a solo album and continued to write songs, reuniting with the group for benefit concerts and, after 1978, to tour regularly, which they did until Travers’ death in 2009. In 2000, he founded Operation Respect, a nonprofit dedicated to creating safe and tolerant learning environments for schoolchildren. Of the group’s legacy, Yarrow said in 2014 on WNYC Studios’ Soundcheck podcast: “These songs are around. They’re in the summer camps. They’re in the schools. They’re in the churches, the synagogues, the mosques even. They’re not going away. They were there before the folk renaissance, and they will stand as part of our culture for a long time.” Yarrow is survived by his wife Mary Beth McCarthy, as well as a son, daughter and granddaughter.

The cookie program is the \"largest entrepreneurial program in the world,\" according to the Girl Scouts. Girl Scout cookie season typically takes place between January and April. The Girl Scouts of the USA announced on Tuesday that the season is kicking off today, January 7. \"Girl Scout Cookie season is about so much more than selling the iconic cookies people know and love,\" said GSUSA Chief Revenue Officer Wendy Lou. \"The funds girls earn throughout the season directly power girls' journeys in leadership, entrepreneurship and community building. The sweet success of each sale is a testament to how much girls can change the world when they put their minds to it.\" The 2025 cookie lineup was announced on Tuesday, with the highly sought-after flavors.

                "title": "Gulf Coast of the United States - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Gulf Coast of the United States, also known as the Gulf South or the South Coast, is the coastline along the Southern United States where they meet the Gulf of Mexico. The coastal states that have a shoreline on the Gulf of Mexico are Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, and these are known as the Gulf States.[2] The economy of the Gulf Coast area is dominated by industries related to energy, petrochemicals, fishing, aerospace, agriculture, and tourism. The large cities of the region are (from west to east) Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Houston, Galveston, Beaumont, Lake Charles, Lafayette, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Gulfport, Biloxi, Mobile, Pensacola, Panama City, St. Petersburg, and Tampa. All are the centers or major cities of their respective metropolitan areas and many of which contain large ports. The Gulf Coast is made of many inlets, bays, and lagoons. The coast is intersected by numerous rivers, the largest of which is the Mississippi River. Much of the land along the Gulf Coast is, or was, marshland.[3] Ringing the Gulf Coast is the Gulf Coastal Plain, which reaches from Southern Texas to the western Florida Panhandle, while the western portions of the Gulf Coast are made up of many barrier islands and peninsulas, including the 130-mile (210 km) Padre Island along the Texas coast. These landforms protect numerous bays and inlets providing as a barrier to oncoming waves. The central part of the Gulf Coast, from eastern Texas through Louisiana, consists primarily of marshland. The eastern part of the Gulf Coast, predominantly Florida, is dotted with many bays and inlets. The Gulf Coast climate is humid subtropical, although Southwest Florida features a tropical climate. Much of the year is warm to hot along the Gulf Coast, while the three winter months bring periods of cool (or rarely, cold) weather mixed with mild temperatures. The area is highly vulnerable to hurricanes as well as floods and severe thunderstorms. Much of the Gulf Coast has a summer precipitation maximum, with July or August commonly the wettest month due to the combination of frequent summer thunderstorms produced by relentless heat and humidity, and tropical weather systems, including tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes, while winter and early spring rainfall also can be heavy. This pattern is evident in southern cites as Houston, New Orleans, Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida. However, the central and southern Florida peninsula and South Texas has a pronounced winter dry season, as at Tampa and Fort Myers. On the central and southern Texas coast, winter, early spring and mid-summer are markedly drier, and September is the wettest month on average at Corpus Christi and Brownsville, Texas. Tornadoes are infrequent at the coast but do occur; however, they occur more frequently in inland portions of Gulf Coast states. Over most of the Gulf Coast from Houston, Texas, eastward, extreme rainfall events are a significant threat, commonly from tropical weather systems, which can bring 4 to 10 or more inches of rain in a single day. In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall along the central Texas coast, then migrated to and stalled over the greater Houston area for several days, producing extreme, unprecedented rainfall totals of over 40 inches (1,000 mm) in many areas, unleashing widespread flooding. Climate scientists predict more hurricanes for Florida[4] and the Texas coastline in particular.[5] Earthquakes are extremely rare to the area, but a 6.0 earthquake in the Gulf of Mexico on September 10, 2006, could be felt from the cities of New Orleans to Tampa. Due to the release of greenhouse gas emissions, glaciers and ice sheets are melting and expanding the oceans. The United States coastlines are projected to rise 1 foot in three decades or between 10 and 12 inches on average by 2050.[6] The Gulf Coast will likely see the biggest change, with sea levels expected to rise between 14 and 18 inches. The Global and Regional Sea Level Rise Report predicted more frequent, major and destructive high tide flooding events along with taller storm surges by 2050 after scientists determined high tide flooding has been \"increasingly common\" over the past few years due to the rising sea levels.[6] The impacts are expected to be dramatic. Low-lying coastal areas are expected to experience multiple factors, including increased levels of flooding, accelerated erosion, loss of wetlands and low-lying terrestrial ecosystems, and seawater intrusion into freshwater sources. Rising sea level and erosion will also imperil critical habitats for many commercially important fisheries that depend on inshore waters for either permanent residence or nursery area.[7] In 2021 alone rising sea levels cost the United States approximately $2.6 billion in relief efforts and caused at least seven deaths.[6] By 2051, the cost of flood damage is expected to increase by 61%, or $32 billion.[8] The Gulf Coast is a major center of economic activity. The marshlands along the Louisiana and Texas coasts provide breeding grounds and nurseries for ocean life that drive the fishing and shrimping industries. The Port of South Louisiana (Metropolitan New Orleans in Laplace) and the Port of Houston are two of the ten busiest ports in the world by cargo volume.[9] As of 2004, seven of the top ten busiest ports in the U.S. are on the Gulf Coast.[10] The discovery of oil and gas deposits along the coast and offshore, combined with easy access to shipping, have made the Gulf Coast the heart of the U.S. petrochemical industry. The coast contains nearly 4,000 oil platforms. Besides the above, the region features other important industries including aerospace and biomedical research, as well as older industries such as agriculture and — especially since the development of the Gulf Coast beginning in the 1920s and the increase in wealth throughout the United States — tourism. Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita have destroyed a number of museums and archives in the Gulf Coast. In 2008 floods in Iowa destroyed the local Flood Museum which held materials from the Great Mississippi and Missouri Rivers Flood of 1993.[11] Before European settlers arrived in the region, the Gulf Coast was home to several pre-Columbian kingdoms which had extensive trade networks with empires such as the Aztecs and the Mississippi Mound Builders. Shark and alligator teeth and shells from the Gulf have been found as far north as Ohio, in the mounds of the Hopewell culture.[12] The first Europeans to settle the Gulf Coast were primarily the French and the Spanish. The Louisiana Purchase (1803), Adams–Onís Treaty (1819) and the Texas Revolution (1835–1836) made the Gulf Coast a part of the United States during the first half of the 19th century. As the U.S. population continued to expand its frontiers westward, the Gulf Coast was a natural magnet in the South providing access to shipping lanes and both national and international commerce. The development of sugar and cotton production (enabled by slavery) allowed the South to prosper. By the mid-19th century the city of New Orleans, being situated as a key to commerce on the Mississippi River and in the Gulf, had become the largest U.S. city not on the Atlantic seaboard and the fourth largest in the U.S. overall. Two major events were turning points in the earlier history of the Gulf Coast region. The first was the American Civil War, which caused severe damage to some economic sectors in the South, including the Gulf Coast. The second event was the Galveston Hurricane of 1900. At the end of the 19th century Galveston was, with New Orleans, one of the most developed cities in the region. The city had the third busiest port in the U.S.[13] and its financial district was known as the \"Wall Street of the South\".[14] Since then the Gulf Coast has been hit with numerous other hurricanes. On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast as a Category 3 hurricane. It was the most damaging storm in the history of the United States, causing upwards of $80 billion in damages, and leaving over 1,800 dead. Again in 2008, the Gulf Coast was struck by a catastrophic hurricane. Due to its immense size, Hurricane Ike caused devastation from the Louisiana coastline all the way to the Kenedy County, Texas, region near Corpus Christi.[15] In addition, Ike caused flooding and significant damage along the Mississippi coastline and the Florida Panhandle[16] Ike killed 112 people and left upwards of 300 people missing, never to be found.[17] Hurricane Ike was the third most damaging storm in the history of the United States, causing more than $25 billion[18] in damage along the coast, leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless, and sparking the largest search-and-rescue operation in U.S. history.[19] Other than the hurricanes, the Gulf Coast has redeveloped dramatically over the course of the 20th century. The gulf coast is highly populated. The petrochemical industry, launched with the major discoveries of oil in Texas and spurred on by further discoveries in the Gulf waters, has been a vehicle for development in the central and western Gulf which has spawned development on a variety of fronts in these regions. Texas in particular has benefited tremendously from this industry over the course of the 20th century and economic diversification has made the state a magnet for population and home to more Fortune 500 companies than any other U.S. state. Florida has grown as well, driven to a great extent by its long established tourism industry but also by its position as a gateway to the Caribbean and Latin America. As of 2024, Texas and Florida are the second and third most populous states in the nation, respectively. Other areas of the Gulf Coast have benefited less, though economic development fueled by tourism has greatly increased property values along the coast, and is now a severe danger to the valuable but fragile ecosystems of the Gulf Coast.

                "content": "Video above: Trump blasts Jimmy Carter over Panama Canal President-elect Donald Trump announced that the Gulf of Mexico will be getting a new name in a news conference at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday. \"We're going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, which has a beautiful ring,\" Trump said. \"The Gulf of America, what a beautiful name, and it's appropriate.\" The motion came about while he was discussing Mexico. Trump then discussed the concept of \"approaching the dawn of America's golden age.\" >> WVTM 13 ON-THE-GO: Download our app for free Since his first run for the White House in 2016, Trump has repeatedly clashed with Mexico over a number of issues, including border security and the imposition of tariffs on imported goods. He vowed then to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and make Mexico pay for it. The U.S. ultimately constructed or refurbished about 450 miles of wall during his first term. The Gulf of Mexico is often referred to as the United States’ “Third Coast” due to its coastline across five southeastern states. Mexicans use a Spanish version of the same name for the gulf: “El Golfo de México.” Americans and Mexicans diverge on what to call another key body of water, the river that forms the border between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. Americans call it the Rio Grande; Mexicans call it the Rio Bravo. Trump did not elaborate on how he would go about renaming the body of water that is monitored during hurricane season and vital to the country's economy. President Barack Obama renamed Mount McKinley to Denali through the Department of Interior in 2015. But even if Trump were to go through U.S. channels, not all countries would have to follow suit. The International Hydrographic Organization, which the United States and Mexico are members of, works to make sure all of the world's major bodies of water are charted similarly. Just after Trump’s comments on Tuesday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said during an interview with podcaster Benny Johnson that she would direct her staff to draft legislation to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico, a move she said would take care of funding for new maps and administrative policy materials throughout the federal government. Yes. In 2012, a member of the Mississippi Legislature proposed a bill to rename portions of the gulf that touch that state’s beaches “Gulf of America,” a move the bill author later referred to as a “joke.” That bill, which was referred to a committee, did not pass. Two years earlier, comedian Stephen Colbert had joked on his show that, following the massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, it should be renamed “Gulf of America” because, “We broke it, we bought it.” There’s a long-running dispute over the name of the Sea of Japan among Japan, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, with South Korea arguing that the current name wasn’t commonly used until Korea was under Japanese rule. At an International Hydrographic Organization meeting in 2020, member states agreed on a plan to replace names with numerical identifiers and develop a new digital standard for modern geographic information systems. The Persian Gulf has been widely known by that name since the 16th century, although usage of “Gulf” and “Arabian Gulf” is dominant in many countries in the Middle East. The government of Iran threatened to sue Google in 2012 over the company’s decision not to label the body of water at all on its maps. There have been other conversations about bodies of water, including from Trump’s 2016 opponent. According to materials revealed by WikiLeaks in a hack of her campaign chairman’s personal account, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2013 told an audience that, by China’s logic that it claimed nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, then the U.S. after World War II could have labeled the Pacific Ocean the “American Sea.” This article contains information from The Associated Press.

                "content": "Share President-elect Donald Trump announcing Tuesday he wants to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. President-elect Donald Trump suggested on Tuesday that the Gulf of Mexico should be renamed the \"Gulf of America,\" calling the proposed name \"beautiful\" and reflective of U.S. prominence in the region. The suggestion marks Trump’s latest foray into redrawing geographical nomenclature. He has previously referred to Canada as the \"51st State,\" proposed that Denmark consider ceding Greenland, and called for Panama to return control of the Panama Canal. Trump’s remarks came against a backdrop of strained U.S.-Mexico relations that defined much of his political career. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump vowed to build a border wall between the two nations and make Mexico pay for it. While the U.S. ultimately built or refurbished about 450 miles of the wall during his first term, Mexico did not finance it. Renaming the Gulf of Mexico would face significant hurdles. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), which oversees the naming of seas, oceans, and navigable waters globally, would need to approve the change. Both the United States and Mexico are members of the IHO, and it is common for countries to refer to the same body of water by different names in their own documentation. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) quickly endorsed Trump’s proposal. During an interview Tuesday, she announced plans to draft legislation to fund the renaming effort and cover administrative updates to federal maps and documents. The Gulf of Mexico, bordered by five southeastern U.S. states, has often been dubbed America’s \"Third Coast.\" In Spanish, it is referred to as \"El Golfo de México,\" highlighting a shared linguistic and cultural connection to the region. The Gulf of Mexico has carried its current name for over four centuries, likely derived from the Native American city of \"Mexico.\" It first appeared on maps in the 16th century, solidifying its place in historical and cartographic records. Despite Trump’s proposal, the idea of renaming the gulf is not entirely new. In 2012, a Mississippi lawmaker introduced a bill to rename portions of the Gulf of Mexico touching the state’s shores as the \"Gulf of America.\" The bill, later described as a joke, failed to gain traction. Even satirical takes on the subject have surfaced. Comedian Stephen Colbert joked during his show in 2010 that, after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the gulf should be renamed the \"Gulf of America,\" saying, \"We broke it, we bought it.\" Trump’s suggestion highlights ongoing international debates over place names. Disputes over the Sea of Japan, Persian Gulf, and South China Sea illustrate the geopolitical sensitivities tied to geographic nomenclature. Some historical precedents exist for such changes, but they are rare. In 2015, President Barack Obama approved the renaming of Mount McKinley to Denali, a move Trump has said he opposes.

                "content": "Published by The Maritime Executive Published by The Maritime Executive Published by The Maritime Executive Published by The Maritime Executive Published Jan 7, 2025 4:39 PM by The Maritime Executive At a news conference Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump suggested that his administration would try to rename the Gulf of Mexico, a name dating back to the Spanish conquistadores who first colonized the region in the 1500s. In a brief comment amidst a press conference on other economic and security matters - including the potential annexation of Greenland and Panama - Trump told reporters that he would like the body of water to be named the \"Gulf of America\" because \"we do most of the work there and it's ours.\" \"We’re going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, which has a beautiful ring,\" Trump declared during a Tuesday press conference from Mar-a-Lago. \"That covers a lot of territory. The Gulf of America, what a beautiful name - and it's appropriate. It's appropriate.\" The announcement was a footnote in the press conference, and Trump did not elaborate on the source of the idea. The name has been proposed before, but never seriously: The last instance in recent political history was in 2012, when a Democratic congressman from Mississippi suggested renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the \"Gulf of America\" to mock anti-immigration proposals. The gulf's name dates back to the Spanish conquests of the early 1500s, when it was known as the Golfo de Nueva Espana or the Golfo de Mexico. Aside from indigenous inhabitants, it was an exclusively Spanish domain for more than 150 years, until the arrival of the French explorers who settled Louisiana. The current U.S. coastline developed another 100-150 years later with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the acquisition of Florida from Spain in 1819, and Texas' independence from Mexico in 1836. Today, the U.S. exclusive economic zone covers about 44 percent of the surface of the Gulf of Mexico, and U.S. states account for nearly half of the Gulf's coastline. Both Mexico and the U.S. have similar offshore oil production figures in the Gulf of Mexico, thanks to the abundant resources off Texas and Louisiana and the superlarge fields in Mexico's Bay of Campeche.

                "title": "Mark Zuckerberg - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (/ˈzʌkərbɜːrɡ/; born May 14, 1984) is an American businessman who co-founded the social media service Facebook and its parent company Meta Platforms, of which he is the chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder. Zuckerberg has been the subject of multiple lawsuits regarding the creation and ownership of the website as well as issues such as user privacy. Zuckerberg briefly attended Harvard College, where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. He became the world's youngest self-made billionaire[a] in 2008, at age 23, and has consistently ranked among the world's wealthiest individuals. He has also used his funds to organize multiple donations, including the establishment of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. A film depicting Zuckerberg's early career, legal troubles and initial success with Facebook, The Social Network, was released in 2010 and won multiple Academy Awards. His prominence and fast rise in the technology industry has prompted political and legal attention. Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York to psychiatrist Karen (née Kempner) and dentist Edward Zuckerberg.[2][3] He and his three sisters (Arielle, Randi, and Donna) were raised in a Reform Jewish household[4] in Dobbs Ferry, New York.[5] His great-grandparents were emigrants from Austria, Germany, and Poland.[6] Zuckerberg initially attended Ardsley High School before transferring to Phillips Exeter Academy. He was captain of the fencing team.[7][8] Zuckerberg learned computer programming in his childhood. At about the age of eleven, he created \"ZuckNet\", a program that allowed computers at the family home and his father's dental office to communicate with each other.[9] During Zuckerberg's high-school years, he worked to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot[10] and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.[11] The New Yorker once said of Zuckerberg, \"some kids played computer games. Mark created them.\"[5] While still in high school, he attended Mercy College taking a graduate computer course on Thursday evenings.[5] The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard in 2002, he had already achieved a \"reputation as a programming prodigy\".[5] He studied psychology and computer science,[12] resided in Kirkland House,[13] and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi.[5] In his second year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and help them form study groups.[14] Later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, explained: We had books called \"Face Books\", which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was \"hotter\" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.[15] The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches preventing students from accessing the Internet.[16] In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was \"completely improper\".[15] In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website.[18] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched \"Thefacebook\", originally located at thefacebook.com, in partnership with his roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.[19][20] An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, \"The Photo Address Book\", which students referred to as \"The Facebook\". Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.[20] Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, when he was using their ideas to build a competing product.[21] The three complained to The Harvard Crimson, and the newspaper began an investigation in response. While Zuckerberg tried to convince the editors not to run the story,[22] he also broke into two of the editors' email accounts—for which he made use of their private login data logs from TheFacebook.[23][24] Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement.[25] The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares and $20 million in cash.[26] Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a \"Harvard thing\" until he decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate and co-founder Dustin Moskovitz.[27] They began with Columbia University, New York University, Stanford University, Dartmouth College, Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, and Yale University.[28] Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year in order to complete the project.[29] Zuckerberg, Moskovitz and the other co-founders moved to Palo Alto, California, where they leased a small house that served as an office. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met Peter Thiel, who invested in his company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard, but eventually decided to remain in California, where Zuckerberg appreciated the \"mythical place\" of Silicon Valley, the center of computer technology in California.[30][31] They had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company. In an interview in 2007, Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: \"It's not because of the amount of money. For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me.\"[32] The same year, speaking at Y Combinator's Startup School course at Stanford University, Zuckerberg made a controversial assertion that \"young people are just smarter\" and that other entrepreneurs should bias towards hiring young people.[33] Zuckerberg restated these goals to Wired magazine in 2010, \"The thing I really care about is the mission, making the world open.\"[34] Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg had sought the advice of former Netscape CFO Peter Currie regarding financing strategies for Facebook.[35] On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that Facebook had reached the 500-million-user mark.[36] When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth, he explained: I guess we could ... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads ... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we aren't like that. We make enough money. Right, I mean, we are keeping things running; we are growing at the rate we want to.[34] In 2010, Steven Levy, who wrote the 1984 book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, wrote that Zuckerberg \"clearly thinks of himself as a hacker\". Zuckerberg said that \"it's OK to break things\" \"to make them better\".[37][38] Facebook instituted \"hackathons\" held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project.[37] The company provided music, food, and beer at the hackathons, and many Facebook staff members, including Zuckerberg, regularly attended.[38] \"The idea is that you can build something really good in a night\", Zuckerberg told Levy. \"And that's part of the personality of Facebook now ... It's definitely very core to my personality.\"[37] In 2007, Zuckerberg was added to MIT Technology Review's TR35 list as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[39] Vanity Fair magazine named Zuckerberg number 1 on its 2010 list of the Top 100 \"most influential people of the Information Age\".[40] Zuckerberg ranked number 23 on the Vanity Fair 100 list in 2009.[41] In 2010, Zuckerberg was chosen as number 16 in New Statesman's annual survey of the world's 50 most influential figures.[42] In a 2011 interview with PBS shortly after the death of Steve Jobs, Zuckerberg said that Jobs had advised him on how to create a management team at Facebook that was \"focused on building as high quality and good things as you are\".[43] On October 1, 2012, Zuckerberg met with then Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market.[44][45] Russia's communications minister tweeted that Medvedev persuaded Zuckerberg to open a research center in Moscow instead of trying to lure away Russian programmers. In 2012, Facebook had roughly 9 million users in Russia, while domestic clone VK had around 34 million.[46][47] Rebecca Van Dyck, Facebook's head of consumer marketing, said that 85 million American Facebook users were exposed to the first day of the Home promotional campaign on April 6, 2013.[48] On August 19, 2013, The Washington Post reported that Zuckerberg's Facebook profile was hacked by an unemployed web developer.[49] At the 2013 TechCrunch Disrupt conference, held in September, Zuckerberg stated that he was working towards registering the 5 billion people who were not connected to the Internet as of the conference on Facebook. Zuckerberg then explained that this is intertwined with the aim of the Internet.org project, whereby Facebook, with the support of other technology companies, seeks to increase the number of people connected to the internet.[50][51] Zuckerberg was the keynote speaker at the 2014 Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in Barcelona, Spain, in March 2014, which was attended by 75,000 delegates. Various media sources highlighted the connection between Facebook's focus on mobile technology and Zuckerberg's speech, stating that mobile represents the future of the company.[52] Zuckerberg's speech expands upon the goal that he raised at the TechCrunch conference in September 2013, whereby he is working towards expanding Internet coverage into developing countries.[53] Alongside other American technology figures such as Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook, Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician Lu Wei, known as the \"Internet czar\" for his influence in the enforcement of China's online policy, at Facebook's headquarters on December 8, 2014. The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q&A session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he conversed in Mandarin Chinese; although Facebook is banned in China, Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation's burgeoning entrepreneur sector.[54] Zuckerberg fielded questions during a live Q&A session at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11, 2014. The founder and CEO explained that he does not believe Facebook is a waste of time, because it facilitates social engagement, and participating in a public session was so that he could \"learn how to better serve the community\".[55][56] Zuckerberg receives a one-dollar salary as CEO of Facebook.[57] In June 2016, Business Insider named Zuckerberg one of the \"Top 10 Business Visionaries Creating Value for the World\" along with Elon Musk and Sal Khan, due to the fact that he and his wife \"pledged to give away 99% of their wealth-then estimated at $55.0 billion\".[58] On May 25, 2017, at Harvard's 366th commencement day, Zuckerberg, after giving a commencement speech,[59] received an honorary degree from Harvard.[60][61] In January 2019, Zuckerberg laid plans to integrate an end-to-end encrypted system for three major social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.[62] On August 14, 2020, Facebook integrated the chat systems for Instagram and Messenger on both iOS and Android devices. The update encouraged cross-communication between Instagram and Facebook users.[63] A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, i2hub, another campus-only service, created by Wayne Chang and focusing on peer-to-peer file sharing, was launched. At the time, both i2hub and Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. In August 2004, Zuckerberg, Andrew McCollum, Adam D'Angelo, and Sean Parker launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called Wirehog, a precursor to Facebook Platform applications, which was launched in 2007.[64][65][66] In 2013, Zuckerberg launched Internet.org, which he described as an initiative to provide Internet access to the five billion people without it as of the launch date. The project faced significant opposition in India, where activists said its limited internet ran counter to the principle of net neutrality; Zuckerberg responded by saying that a limited internet was better than no internet. Internet.org was shut down in India in February 2016, although Zuckerberg later met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss further possibilities.[67][68] Zuckerberg is a board member of the solar sail spacecraft development project Breakthrough Starshot, which he co-founded with Yuri Milner and Stephen Hawking in 2016.[69] Harvard students Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com (later called ConnectU).[21] They filed a lawsuit in 2004; it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28, 2007. It was refiled soon thereafter in a federal court in Boston. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between ConnectU and i2hub. On June 25, 2008, the case settled and Facebook agreed to transfer over 1.2 million common shares and pay $20 million in cash.[70] In November 2007, confidential court documents were posted on the website of 02138, a magazine that catered to Harvard alumni. They included Zuckerberg's Social Security number, his parents' home address, and his girlfriend's address. Although Facebook filed to have the documents removed, the judge ruled in favor of 02138.[71] In 2005, Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg and Facebook, alleging that Zuckerberg had illegally spent Saverin's money on personal expenses. The lawsuit was settled out of court and, although terms of the settlement were sealed, the company affirmed Saverin's title as co-founder of Facebook, and Saverin agreed to stop talking to the press.[72][73] In June 2010, then Pakistani Deputy Attorney General Muhammad Azhar Sidiqque launched a criminal investigation into Zuckerberg and Facebook co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes after a \"Draw Muhammad\" contest was hosted on Facebook. The investigation also named the anonymous German woman who created the contest. Sidiqque asked the country's police to contact Interpol to have Zuckerberg and the three others arrested for blasphemy. On May 19, 2010, Facebook's website was temporarily blocked in Pakistan until Facebook removed the contest from its website at the end of May. Sidiqque also asked its UN representative to raise the issue with the United Nations General Assembly.[74][75] In June 2010, Paul Ceglia, the owner of a wood pellet fuel company in Allegany County, upstate New York, filed suit against Zuckerberg, claiming 84 percent ownership of Facebook and seeking monetary damages. According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that an initial fee of $1,000 entitled Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as an additional 1% interest in the business per day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was Facemash, the predecessor to Facebook, but did not register the domain name thefacebook.com until January 1, 2004. The Facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as \"completely frivolous\". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told a reporter that Ceglia's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an out-of-court settlement.[76][77] On October 26, 2012, federal authorities arrested Ceglia, charging him with mail and wire fraud and of \"tampering with, destroying and fabricating evidence in a scheme to defraud the Facebook founder of billions of dollars\". Ceglia is accused of fabricating emails to make it appear that he and Zuckerberg discussed details about an early version of Facebook, although after examining their emails, investigators found there was no mention of Facebook in them.[78] Some law firms withdrew from the case before it was initiated and others after Ceglia's arrest.[79][80] In 2014 Zuckerberg purchased 700 acres of land on the Hawaiian island of Kauaʻi. In January 2017, Zuckerberg filed eight \"quiet title and partition\" lawsuits against hundreds of native Hawaiians to claim small tracts of land that they owned within his acreage.[81] Zuckerberg responded to criticisms in a Facebook post, stating that the lawsuits were a good faith effort to pay the partial owners of the land their \"fair share\".[81] When he learned that Hawaiian land ownership law differs from that of the other 49 states, he dropped the lawsuits. Zuckerberg stated that he regretted not taking the time to understand the process and its history before moving ahead.[82][83] On April 10 and 11, 2018, Zuckerberg testified before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation regarding the usage of personal data by Facebook in relation to the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal.[84][85] He called the whole affair a breach of trust between Aleksandr Kogan, Cambridge Analytica, and Facebook.[86] Zuckerberg refused requests to appear to give evidence on the matter to a Parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom.[87] On October 1, 2020, the US Senate Commerce Committee unanimously voted to issue subpoenas to the CEOs of three top tech firms, including Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai and Twitter's Jack Dorsey. The subpoenas aimed to force the CEOs to testify about the legal immunity the law affords tech platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934. US Republicans argued that the law unduly protected social media companies against allegations of anti-conservative censorship.[88] On March 25, 2021, Zuckerberg testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee regarding Facebook's role in the spread of misinformation and hate speech on the platform. During the hearing, he was questioned about Facebook's handling of user data, its role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol Building, and its efforts to combat misinformation and hate speech. Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook had a responsibility to address these issues and outlined the steps that the company is taking to improve its policies and practices. The hearing was part of a broader effort by Congress to hold tech companies accountable for their role in shaping public discourse and protecting user privacy.[89] In a January 2024 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child safety and social media platforms, Zuckerberg, along with other tech CEOs, were questioned about their companies' practices. During the hearing, he apologized to the families of children who were victims of online abuse and harm.[90][91] Court documents allege that Zuckerberg personally rejected Meta's proposals to improve teenagers' mental health. He consistently opposed efforts to enhance well-being on Facebook and Instagram, overriding senior executives such as Instagram head Adam Mosseri and Global Affairs President Nick Clegg, as revealed in an ongoing lawsuit. Internal communications disclosed in the Massachusetts-initiated legal action depict Zuckerberg's resistance to better protect over 30 million teens on Instagram in the U.S., highlighting his substantial influence on Meta's decisions impacting billions of users. These documents also shed light on occasional tensions between Zuckerberg and other Meta officials advocating for improved user well-being.[92] A movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook, The Social Network, was released on October 1, 2010, starring Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. After Zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, \"I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive.\"[93] Also, after the film's script was leaked on the Internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray Zuckerberg in a wholly positive light, he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a \"good guy\".[94] The film is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, which the book's publicist once described as \"big juicy fun\" rather than \"reportage\".[95] The film's screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told New York magazine, \"I don't want my fidelity to be the truth; I want it to be storytelling\", adding, \"What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?\".[96] Upon winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture on January 16, 2011, producer Scott Rudin thanked Facebook and Zuckerberg \"for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other\".[97] Sorkin, who won for Best Screenplay, retracted some of the impressions given in his script:[98] In January 2011, Zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was hosted by Jesse Eisenberg. They both said it was the first time they had met.[99] Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg, who had been critical of his portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie. Zuckerberg replied, \"It was interesting.\"[100] In a subsequent interview about their meeting, Eisenberg explained that he was \"nervous to meet him, because I had spent now, a year and a half thinking about him ...\". He added, \"Mark has been so gracious about something that's really so uncomfortable ... The fact that he would do SNL and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous. It's the best possible way to handle something that, I think, could otherwise be very uncomfortable.\"[101][102] According to David Kirkpatrick, former technology editor at Fortune magazine and author of The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company that is Connecting the World (2011),[103] \"the film is only 40% true ... he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way, the way Zuckerberg is played in the movie.\" He says that \"a lot of the factual incidents are accurate, but many are distorted and the overall impression is false\", and concludes that primarily \"his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the Internet\".[104] Although the film portrayed Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at Harvard, Zuckerberg stated that he had no interest in joining the clubs.[5] Kirkpatrick agreed that the impression implied by the film is \"false\". Karel Baloun, a former senior engineer at Facebook, noted that the \"image of Zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated ... It is fiction ...\". He likewise dismissed the film's assertion that he \"would deliberately betray a friend\".[104] Zuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of The Simpsons titled \"Loan-a Lisa\", which first aired on October 3, 2010. In the episode, Lisa Simpson and her friend Nelson encounter Zuckerberg at an entrepreneurs' convention. Zuckerberg tells Lisa that she does not need to graduate from college to be wildly successful, referencing Bill Gates and Richard Branson as examples.[105] On October 9, 2010, Saturday Night Live lampooned Zuckerberg and Facebook.[106] Andy Samberg portrayed the role of Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg himself was reported to have been amused, \"I thought this was funny.\"[107] Stephen Colbert awarded a \"Medal of Fear\" to Zuckerberg at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear on October 30, 2010, \"because he values his privacy much more than he values yours\".[108] Zuckerberg appeared in the climax of 2013 documentary film Terms and Conditions May Apply.[109][110][111] The South Park episode \"Franchise Prequel\" mocked him. According to CNET, he was portrayed as \"a rosy-cheeked bully nerd who utters strange noises, makes peculiar kung fu gestures and turns up wherever he likes in people's houses\".[112] Zuckerberg founded the Startup:Education foundation.[113] It was reported in September 2010 that he had donated $100 million to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey.[114][115] Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg.[116] Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, \"The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, I didn't want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project. I was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate.\"[117] Newark Mayor Cory Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously.[117] The money was largely wasted, according to journalist Dale Russakoff.[118][119] In 2010, Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and investor Warren Buffett signed The Giving Pledge, in which they said they would donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time, and invited others among the wealthy to donate 50 percent or more of their wealth to charity.[120] In December 2012, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan said that over the course of their lives they would give the majority of their wealth to \"advancing human potential and promoting equality\" in the spirit of The Giving Pledge.[121][122] In December 2013, Zuckerberg announced a donation of 18 million Facebook shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, to be executed by the end of the month—based on Facebook's valuation as of then, the shares totaled $990 million in value. Later that month, the donation was recognized as the largest charitable gift on public record for that year.[123] The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Zuckerberg and his wife at the top of the magazine's annual list of 50 most generous Americans for 2013, having donated roughly $1 billion to charity.[124] In October 2014, Zuckerberg and his wife donated $25 million to combat the Ebola virus disease, specifically the West African Ebola virus epidemic.[125][126] The couple endowed the foundation of the San Francisco General Hospital in February 2015 with $75 million, which was the biggest individual donation to a U.S. public hospital. The hospital honored them by renaming itself as The Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center. Later in 2020, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a near-unanimous, non-binding measure condemning the renaming, citing concerns that a public hospital should not be named after an individual whose social media platform is accused of \"endangering public health, spreading misinformation, and violating privacy\".[127] On December 1, 2015, the couple pledged to transfer 99% of their Facebook shares, then valued at $45 billion, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI).[128] The funds would not be transferred immediately, but over the course of their lives.[129] Instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to, as Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Larry Page, Sergey Brin and other billionaires have done, Zuckerberg and Chan chose to use the structure of a limited liability company (LLC). Some journalists and academics have said the CZI conducts philanthrocapitalism.[130][131][132] In 2016, CZI gave $600 million to create the tax-exempt charity Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, a collaborative research space in San Francisco's Mission Bay district near the University of California, San Francisco, with the intent to foster interaction and collaboration between scientists at UCSF, University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University. Intellectual property generated would be jointly owned by Biohub and the discoverer's home institution. Unlike foundations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which open up all research funded to unrestricted access and reuse by the public, Biohub retained the right to commercialize any research it funds. Inventors will have the option of making their discoveries open-source, with permission from Biohub.[133][134][135] To increase access to scientific research and promote open science, CZ Biohub requires its investigators and staff scientists to publish submitted manuscripts and related data on preprints servers such as bioRxiv.[136][137] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Zuckerberg donated $25 million to a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-backed accelerator that is searching for treatments for the disease.[138] He also announced $25 million in grants to support local journalism that was impacted by the pandemic and $75 million in advertisement purchases in local newspapers by Facebook, Inc., where Facebook would market itself.[139] In 2002, Zuckerberg registered to vote in Westchester County, New York, where he grew up, but did not cast a ballot until November 2008. Then Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters Spokeswoman, Elma Rosas, told Bloomberg that Zuckerberg is listed as \"no preference\" on voter rolls, and he voted in at least two of the past three general elections, in 2008 and 2012.[140][141] Zuckerberg has never revealed his own political affiliation or voting history. In February 2013, Zuckerberg hosted his first ever fundraising event for then New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. His particular interest on this occasion was education reform, and Christie's education reform work focused on teachers unions and the expansion of charter schools.[142][143] Later that year, Zuckerberg hosted a campaign fundraiser for then Newark mayor Cory Booker, who was running in the 2013 New Jersey special Senate election.[144] In September 2010, with the support of Governor Chris Christie, Booker obtained a US$100 million pledge from Zuckerberg to Newark Public Schools.[145] In December 2012, Zuckerberg donated 18 million shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a community organization that includes education in its list of grant-making areas.[146][147] On April 11, 2013, Zuckerberg led the launch of a 501(c)(4) lobbying group called FWD.us. The founders and contributors to the group were primarily Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors, and its president was Joe Green, a close friend of Zuckerberg.[148][149] The goals of the group include immigration reform, improving the state of education in the United States, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public,[150][151] yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline.[152] In 2013, numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as The League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club, Democracy for America, CREDO, Daily Kos, 350.org, and Presente and Progressives United agreed to either not buy or pull their Facebook ads for at least two weeks, in protest of ads funded by FWD.us that were in support of oil drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline, and in opposition to Obamacare among Republican United States senators who back immigration reform.[153] A media report on June 20, 2013, revealed that Zuckerberg actively engaged with Facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a FWD.us video. In response to a claim that the FWD.us organization is \"just about tech wanting to hire more people\", the Internet entrepreneur replied, \"The bigger problem we're trying to address is ensuring the 11 million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly.\"[154] In June 2013, Zuckerberg joined Facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Celebration. The company first participated in the event in 2011, with 70 employees, and this number increased to 700 for the 2013 march. The 2013 pride celebration was especially significant, as it followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that deemed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional.[155][156] When questioned about the mid-2013 PRISM scandal at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September 2013, Zuckerberg stated that the U.S. government \"blew it\". He further explained that the government performed poorly in regard to the protection of the freedoms of its citizens, the economy, and companies.[50] Zuckerberg placed a statement on his Facebook wall on December 9, 2015, which said that he wants \"to add my voice in support of Muslims in our community and around the world\" in response to the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks and the 2015 San Bernardino attack.[157][158][159][160] The statement also said that Muslims are \"always welcome\" on Facebook, and that his position was a result of the fact that, \"as a Jew, my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities.\"[161][162] On February 24, 2016, Zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten \"Black Lives Matter\" phrases on the company walls and had written \"All Lives Matter\" in their place. Facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. The memo was then leaked by several employees. As Zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but \"malicious as well\". According to Zuckerberg's memo, \"Black Lives Matter doesn't mean other lives don't – it's simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve.\" The memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself \"means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's\". Zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents.[163][164][165] The New York Daily News interviewed Facebook employees who commented anonymously that, \"Zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that Zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase 'Black Lives Matter' must exist, as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and erasure.\"[163] In January 2017, Zuckerberg criticized Donald Trump's executive order to severely limit immigrants and refugees from some countries.[166] He also funded a state-level ballot initiative for the 2020 general election that would raise taxes by altering California's Proposition 13 to require the tax assessment of commercial and industrial properties in the state at market rate.[167] In Donald Trump's book Save America, published in September 2024, he wrote about Zuckerberg's visits to the White House and wrote \"We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison — as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.\"[168] Two months later, they dined at the Mar-a-Lago resort, with Zuckerberg aiming to mend his and his firm's relationship with Trump following the election.[169] Around the same time, Meta reportedly donated $1 million to a Trump-related fund.[170] Especially in his twenties, Zuckerberg had financially supported various progressive causes such as immigration reform and social justice. At least among Republicans, he was generally seen as pro-liberal. In an August 2024 letter to the House Judiciary Committee however, Zuckerberg stated he regretted not doing more to resist pressure from the Biden administration to censor content related to COVID-19. He also noted he no longer intends to donate towards election infrastructure; Republicans had seen those contributions as non-neutral, labeling them \"Zuckerbucks\". As of 2024, Zuckerberg has been discouraging employee activism at Facebook, and according to The New York Times, had privately described his politics as leaning towards libertarianism or classical liberalism.[171][172][173][174] Zuckerberg met fellow Harvard student Priscilla Chan at a frat party during his sophomore year. They began dating in 2003.[175] In September 2010, Chan, who was a medical student at the University of California, San Francisco at the time,[176] moved into his rented house in Palo Alto, California.[177][178] They married on May 19, 2012, in the grounds of his mansion in an event that also celebrated her graduation from medical school.[179][180] Zuckerberg revealed in July 2015 that they were expecting a baby girl and that Chan had previously experienced three miscarriages.[181] Their first daughter was born in December 2015.[182] They announced in a Chinese New Year video that their daughter's Chinese name is Chen Mingyu (Chinese: 陈明宇).[183] Their second daughter was born in August 2017.[184] Zuckerberg and his wife welcomed their third daughter in March 2023 and announced the news across his social media pages.[185] The couple also have a Puli dog named Beast,[186] who has over two million followers on Facebook.[187] Zuckerberg commissioned the visual artist Daniel Arsham to build a 7-foot-tall sculpture of his wife, which was unveiled in 2024.[188] Time named Zuckerberg one of the most influential people in the world in 2008, 2011, 2016, and 2019, and nominated him as a finalist several other times. He was named the Time Person of the Year in 2010, the same year when Facebook eclipsed more than half a billion users.[189] He was also included in the Time 100 AI list in 2024.[190] In December 2016, Zuckerberg was ranked tenth on the Forbes list of the World's Most Powerful People.[191] In the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans in 2023, he was ranked eighth with a personal wealth of $106 billion.[192] In October 2024, he became the second richest person in the world.[193][194] As of December 2024[update], Zuckerberg's net worth was estimated at $219 billion by Forbes, making him the fourth richest person in the world.[195] In 2017, Zuckerberg called for action to stop global warming in a commencement speech at Harvard University.[196] Seven years later, he purchased the mega-yacht Launchpad (formerly Project 1010) for 300 million US-Dollar.[197] That same year, he put the yacht into operation; it emits 40 tons of carbon dioxide per hour,[198] which runs counter to his own call for \"stopping climate change\".[196] Born and raised in a Reform Jewish household, Zuckerberg later identified himself as an atheist. However, he said in 2016 that, \"I went through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important.\"[7][199][200] In 2017, he and his wife began a nationwide tour \"to visit every state in the union and learn more about a sliver of the nearly two billion people who regularly use the social network\". He met with farmers and business owners, and spoke at Mother Emanuel, where a shooting took place in 2015.[201][202] In 2022, Zuckerberg took up training in both mixed martial arts (MMA) and Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ), and has been open about his love for the two sports.[203] He competed in a BJJ tournament on May 6, 2023, and won both a silver and gold medal in gi and no gi, competing at white belt.[204] In July 2023, he was promoted to blue belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu by Dave Camarillo.[205] Four months later, Zuckerberg announced that he was preparing to make his MMA debut but had suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in training that required surgery and had delayed this.[206]",

After attending Phillips Exeter Academy, Zuckerberg enrolled at Harvard University in 2002. On February 4, 2004, he launched thefacebook.com (renamed Facebook in 2005), a directory in which fellow Harvard students entered their own information and photos into a template that he had devised. Within two weeks half of the student body had signed up. Zuckerberg’s roommates, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes, helped him add features and make the site available to other campuses across the country. Facebook quickly became popular as registered users could create profiles, upload photos and other media, and keep in touch with friends. It differed from other social networking sites, however, in its emphasis on real names (and e-mail addresses), or “trusted connections.” It also laid particular emphasis on networking, with information disseminated not only to each individual’s network of friends but also to friends of friends—what Zuckerberg called the “social graph.” In the summer of 2004 the trio moved their headquarters to Palo Alto, California, where Zuckerberg talked venture capitalist Peter Thiel into giving them seed money. Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard to concentrate on the fledgling company, of which he became CEO and president. In May 2005 Facebook received its first major infusion of venture capital ($12.7 million). Four months later Facebook opened to registration by high-school students. Meanwhile, foreign colleges and universities also began to sign up, and by September 2006 anyone with an e-mail address could join a regional network based on where he or she lived. About that time Zuckerberg turned down a $1 billion buyout offer from Yahoo!, but in 2007 Facebook struck a deal with Microsoft in which the software company paid $240 million for a 1.6 percent stake in Facebook; two years later Digital Sky Technologies purchased a 1.96 percent share for $200 million. In 2008 Zuckerberg’s new worth was estimated at about $1.5 billion. After Facebook’s initial public offering (IPO) of stock in 2012, Zuckerberg’s net worth was estimated at more than $19 billion. In October 2021 Facebook announced that it was changing the name of its parent company to Meta Platforms. The name change reflected an emphasis on the “metaverse”, in which users would interact in virtual reality environments.",

Took the time to call, encourage me and wish me well in my career and it always meant a lot that he did that. RIP, my friend 🙏🏼 Jake Rill Brian Matusz, a left-handed pitcher who spent nearly all of his eight-year MLB career with the Orioles, died on Tuesday. He was 37. The No. 4 overall pick in the 2008 MLB Draft, Matusz pitched in 279 games (68 starts) for Baltimore from 2009-16. He made only one big league appearance for a team other than the O’s -- a three-inning start for the Cubs on July 31, 2016, in their most recent championship season. “A staple in our clubhouse from 2009-16, Brian was beloved throughout Birdland, and his passion for baseball and our community was unmatched,” the Orioles said in a statement. “He dedicated his time to connecting with any fan he could, was a cherished teammate and always had a smile on his face.” Our hearts are heavy tonight as we mourn the passing of former Oriole, Brian Matusz.A staple in our clubhouse from 2009-2016, Brian was beloved throughout Birdland, and his passion for baseball and our community was unmatched. He dedicated his time to connecting with any fan he… pic.twitter.com/wNN3WkO8l4 Brian Robert Matusz was born on Feb. 11, 1987, in Grand Junction, Colo., and grew up as part of an athletic family. His father, Michael, participated in track and field at Purdue University. His brother, Chris, played baseball at Iowa Wesleyan University. Brian’s baseball career took off during his time at St. Mary’s High School in Phoenix. As a junior in 2004, he went 8-2 with a 0.95 ERA and was named first-team All-State for Arizona. During his ’05 senior campaign, Matusz went 8-1 with a 0.50 ERA and was selected as the Arizona Player of the Year. After being drafted by the Angels in the fourth round of the 2005 MLB Draft, Matusz opted to instead head to the University of San Diego. He went on to have a standout three-year career for the Toreros, capped by winning West Coast Conference Pitcher of the Year in ’08. Matusz, a two-time finalist for the Golden Spikes Award, led the NCAA with 141 strikeouts during his 2008 junior season at San Diego. He recorded 12 wins to go with a 1.71 ERA, the fourth-best single-season mark in the school’s history at the time. Matusz finished his collegiate career as the school’s all-time leader in strikeouts (396). When Matusz joined the Orioles, the organization was loading up on young pitchers. Baltimore took right-hander Matt Hobgood in the first round in 2009, while starters such as Jake Arrieta, Brad Bergesen, Zack Britton and Chris Tillman were expected to develop into key members of the club’s rotation for years to come.

Took the time to call, encourage me and wish me well in my career and it always meant a lot that he did that. RIP, my friend 🙏🏼 Matusz reached the big leagues in 2009, posting a 4.63 ERA over eight starts. He built on those results in ’10, recording a 4.30 ERA over 32 starts and finishing fifth in American League Rookie of the Year Award voting. However, that ended up being the southpaw’s best MLB season as a starter. He then pitched to a 10.69 ERA in 12 starts in ’11 and a 5.42 ERA in 16 starts in ’12. But Matusz reinvented himself as a reliever and stuck in the Majors because of it. He had a 1.35 ERA in 18 relief outings in 2012, helping the Orioles end a 15-year postseason drought. He pitched a scoreless one-third of an inning in the AL Wild Card Game win over the Rangers, then posted a 2.08 ERA while pitching in all five games of the AL Division Series vs. the Yankees.

Matusz continued to serve as a reliable left-handed arm out of the bullpen from 2013-15, when he recorded a 3.32 ERA over 186 appearances. He pitched two-thirds of an inning in the AL Championship Series vs. the Royals in ’14. Many fans will remember Matusz for his success against Hall of Fame slugger David Ortiz. During Matusz’s peak as a reliever, the Orioles frequently saved the lefty in matchups vs. the Red Sox for a key spot against “Big Papi.” Matusz often had the left-handed-hitting Ortiz’s number: The slugger went 4-for-29 (.138) with 13 strikeouts in his career against the southpaw. Matusz’s time in Baltimore ended in 2016, when he had a 12.00 ERA in seven games before being traded to the Braves on May 23 that year. Atlanta released him a week later, and he signed on with the Cubs, pitching in the Minors except for one final big league start on the last day of July. He later pitched for Triple-A Reno in the D-backs’ organization in ’17, then made one start in the Mexican League and nine more with the independent Long Island Ducks in ’19 before calling it a career. Well-liked by fans and the Baltimore community, Matusz etched his place into Orioles history with his relief performances on the field and his generous actions off of it during a memorable time for the franchise.",

Brian Matusz, a former Baltimore Orioles pitcher who spent seven years with the MLB franchise, died on Tuesday, January 7 at the age of 37, although his cause of death has not yet been revealed. A first-round pick, who went fourth overall, out of the University of San Diego Toreros, the left-handed thrower made his professional debut on August 4, 2009 against the Detroit Tigers after spending some time in the minor leagues. He went on to earn 27 wins and maintained an Earned Run Average of 4.85 across his time in Maryland through 279 games, as well as collecting 460 strikeouts as he helped the team to MLB postseason appearances in 2012 and 2016. The winners of the American League East in 2014, the division containing the historic New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, also made it to the American League Championship Series but were swept by the Kansas City Royals. \"Our hearts are heavy tonight as we mourn the passing of former Oriole, Brian Matusz,\" the Orioles wrote on X.com, formerly Twitter. \"A staple in our clubhouse from 2009-2016, Brian was beloved throughout Birdland, and his passion for baseball and our community was unmatched. \"He dedicated his time to connecting with any fan he could, was a cherished teammate, and always had a smile on his face. Brian's family and loved ones are in our thoughts and prayers at this difficult time.\" Matusz also went on to play for the Chicago Cubs for one game in 2016, and earned a World Series winners' ring after the team defeated the Cleveland Guardians to claim their third ever title in franchise history. He also played for the Acereros de Monclova in the Mexican League and the Long Island Ducks in the Atlantic League in 2019. He had a spell in the minor leagues with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2017.

                "content": "Brian Robert Matusz (/ˈmætəs/ MAT-əs; February 11, 1987 – January 7, 2025) was an American professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago Cubs from 2009 to 2016. Matusz attended St. Mary's High School in Phoenix, Arizona, graduating in 2005.[1] He enrolled at the University of San Diego, where he played college baseball for the San Diego Toreros as a starting pitcher. Matusz, Josh Romanski, and Matt Couch anchored the Toreros rotation.[2] In 2008, Matusz was named to the West Coast Conference Pitcher of the Year honors and finalist for the Roger Clemens Award.[3] The Baltimore Orioles selected Matusz in the first round, with the fourth overall selection, in the 2008 MLB draft. Matusz signed a contract with the Orioles on August 15, 2008, the deadline to sign draft picks.[3][4] In spring 2009, he was invited to the Orioles spring training. In June 2009, he was promoted from high Single-A (Frederick Keys) to a starting pitcher for the Double-A Bowie Baysox. He struck out 10 batters in his first start for Bowie on June 17. Matusz was named Baseball America's ninth best overall prospect mid-season in 2009.[5] Before the 2010 season, Baseball America named him the fifth best prospect in all of baseball.[6] Matusz made his MLB debut on August 4, 2009, against the Detroit Tigers. On his MLB debut Matusz went five innings, allowing six hits, one earned run and striking out five. He earned a win in his effort. On September 14, the O's decided to shut Matusz down for the remainder of the season, wary of overextending the rookie in his first big league season.[7] He was named a starting pitcher on Baseball America's 2010 All-Rookie Team.[8] Matusz missed the first two months of the 2011 season with an injury.[9] He returned and got six starts and finished with a 1–4 record with an ERA above 7.00 before being demoted to Triple-A Norfolk on June 30 to work on his velocity.[10] He was later recalled and continued to struggle, posting a 1–7 record and 9.84 ERA before his removal from the starting rotation in September.[11][12] Matusz began the 2012 season in the rotation, but was demoted to the bullpen in August. In the bullpen, Matusz excelled, striking out 19 with a 1.35 ERA in 18 appearances. He also did not allow a single inherited runner to score. He pitched the last three months of the season with a rectus abdominis tear, preventing him from sprinting, but not pitching. He had surgery in October to repair the tear, and was expected to be back for spring training.[13] In 2013, Matusz made the transition to full-time reliever, appearing in 65 games. He was 2–1 with a 3.53 ERA for the Orioles.[14][15] On May 23, 2015, Matusz was ejected from the game against the Miami Marlins in the 12th inning for having a foreign substance on his right forearm. He was the second pitcher to be ejected for a foreign substance in that past week. He was suspended for eight games.[16][15] He posted a 2.94 ERA and 10.29 strikeouts per nine innings 58 relief appearances in 2015. On February 4, 2016, Matusz and the Orioles agreed to a one-year deal to avoid arbitration.[17] On May 23, the Orioles traded Matusz and the 76th pick in the 2016 Major League Baseball draft to the Atlanta Braves in return for minor league pitchers Brandon Barker and Trevor Belicek. The Braves designated Matusz for assignment shortly after completing the trade.[18] On June 15, 2016, the Chicago Cubs signed Matusz to a minor league contract. After being employed solely as a reliever since 2012, the Cubs assigned Matusz to be a starter in the minors. On July 30, 2016, the Cubs called him up to start against the Seattle Mariners on July 31.[19] However, after a poor outing in that game, the Cubs designated him for assignment the very next day.[20] He later cleared waivers and was outrighted to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs.[21] Despite only appearing in one game for the Cubs during their 2016 World Series season, he was given a World Series ring.[22] Matusz elected free agency following the season on November 7.[23] On February 13, 2017, Matusz signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[24] In 11 games for the Triple–A Reno Aces, he struggled to a 6.11 ERA with 13 strikeouts across 17+2⁄3 innings pitched. On May 16, Matusz was released by the Diamondbacks organization.[25] On July 23, 2019, Matusz signed with the Acereros de Monclova of the Mexican League.[26] He made one start, going three innings while allowing five hits and five earned runs (15.00 ERA) with three walks and two strikeouts.[27] On August 2, 2019, Matusz signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.[28][29] In 46+2⁄3 innings across nine starts, he went 2–3 with a 4.05 ERA and 45 strikeouts.[30] Matusz died on January 7, 2025. The Baltimore Orioles statement, which made the announcement, gave no official cause of his death.[31]",

                "content": "The Rookie is an American drama series created by Alexi Hawley for ABC. The series stars Nathan Fillion, Alyssa Diaz, Richard T. Jones, Titus Makin Jr., Melissa O'Neil, Afton Williamson, Mekia Cox, Shawn Ashmore, and Eric Winter. It follows John Nolan, a man in his forties, who becomes the oldest rookie at the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). It is based on real-life LAPD officer William Norcross, who moved to Los Angeles in 2015 and joined the department in his mid-40s. Produced by 20th Television and Lionsgate Television, The Rookie premiered on October 16, 2018. In April 2024, the series was renewed for a seventh season which premiered on January 7, 2025. The series follows John Nolan, a 45-year-old newly divorced man from Pennsylvania, who, nine months after helping police officers during a bank robbery in his hometown, Foxburg, moves to Los Angeles to pursue a new career as a police officer in the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). After graduating from the Police Academy as the oldest rookie on the force, Nolan must navigate the dangerous, unpredictable nature of his job. He is determined to make it in his new career despite the challenges.[1] During an interview, series lead Nathan Fillion said that the drama was inspired by a true story as the LAPD is one of just two agencies that accepts new officers over the age of 37.[2] The man whose story inspired the premise of the show was later revealed to be William Norcross, a college friend of executive producer Jon Steinberg, who based the show on his story. Norcross continues to serve in the LAPD and also as executive producer on The Rookie.[3] On October 26, 2017, ABC announced a straight-to-series order for The Rookie, starring Castle star Nathan Fillion, and written by Castle executive producer and co-showrunner Alexi Hawley. Fillion and Hawley serve as executive producers, along with Mark Gordon, Nicholas Pepper, Michelle Chapman, and Jon Steinberg. The series is produced by ABC Studios and The Mark Gordon Company,[1] and premiered on October 16, 2018.[29] On November 5, 2018, The Rookie was picked up for full season of 20 episodes.[30] On May 10, 2019, ABC renewed the series for a second season which premiered on September 29, 2019.[31][32] On October 28, 2019, the series received a full season order of 20 episodes for the second season.[33] On May 21, 2020, ABC renewed the series for a third season which premiered on January 3, 2021.[34][35] On May 14, 2021, ABC renewed the series for a fourth season, which premiered on September 26, 2021.[36][37] On March 30, 2022, ABC renewed the series for a fifth season which premiered on September 25, 2022.[38][39] On April 17, 2023, ABC renewed the series for a sixth season which premiered on February 20, 2024.[40][41] On February 17, 2024, executive producer and showrunner Alexi Hawley confirmed in an interview with TVLine that the sixth season would contain ten episodes.[42] On April 15, 2024, ABC renewed the series for a seventh season, which premiered on January 7, 2025.[43][44] With the series order in October 2017, Fillion was cast as John Nolan.[1] On February 7, 2018, Afton Williamson and Eric Winter were cast as Talia Bishop and Tim Bradford, respectively.[45] They were shortly followed by Melissa O'Neil as Lucy Chen,[46] Richard T. Jones as Sergeant Wade Grey,[47] Titus Makin as Jackson West,[4] Alyssa Diaz as Angela Lopez,[48] and Mercedes Mason as Captain Zoe Andersen.[6] On August 4, 2019, it was announced that Williamson would not be returning for the second season due to the alleged racial discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual assault she suffered during the first season.[49] On October 2, 2019, Mekia Cox joined the cast as a new series regular, Nyla Harper, for the second season.[50] In January 2018, Liz Friedlander signed on to direct and executive produce the pilot.[51] Production on the pilot began on March 7, 2018,[52] with filming taking place in Los Angeles, Oxnard, Burbank and New York City.[53] On April 15, 2021, police received a call of a possible shooting while filming was taking place between Hartford Avenue and West 5th Street in Los Angeles. Three gunshots were heard by various eyewitnesses, and the production crew confirmed that no one from the show was injured during the incident. Filming in the area was shut down as a result of the reports, but filming continued at other already scheduled locations.[54] Following the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on October 21, 2021, on the set of the film Rust, live weapons were banned from The Rookie while filming.[55] Prior to the ban, the series occasionally used quarter or half rounds on large outdoor set pieces.[56] Showrunner Alexi Hawley stated that \"any risk is too much risk\" and explained that, going forward, only airsoft guns would be used, with muzzle flashes being added in post production using computer-generated imagery.[57] On July 26, 2019, TVLine reported that Afton Williamson, who portrays Talia Bishop, would not be returning for the second season. While the outlet initially claimed that the split was amicable, Williamson, in a lengthy Instagram post, stated that she left the series due to having \"experienced racial discrimination/racially charged inappropriate comments from the hair department.\"[58] Williamson also alleged that she was sexually harassed by guest star Demetrius Grosse, who portrays Kevin Wolfe in a recurring role, as well as an incident of bullying that escalated into sexual assault at a party; the head of the hair department was identified as Sallie Ciganovich. Williamson claimed that she had gone to the showrunners multiple times with these allegations, but was ignored.[59] Everyone involved in the allegations denied them. An investigation was commissioned through the law firm Mitchell Sillerberg and Knupp along with a third-party firm, EXTTI, which conducted nearly 400 hours of interviews and examined video and other evidence.[60] The results of the investigation were published on September 17, 2019, which found that the allegations made by Williamson had no merit and could not be proven. Williamson stood by her claims, calling the results of the investigation \"heartbreaking\" and postulated that the producers had lied to cover up the truth of what happened.[61] The Rookie is broadcast in the United States on ABC and repeats are syndicated across 95% of the country.[62] The first season aired on Tuesday, while the second season aired on Sunday. The Rookie has been licensed in more than 180 countries and territories.[63] The first season was released on DVD in Region 1 on August 27, 2019,[64] and in Region 4 (Australia) on January 22, 2020.[65] The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 68% approval rating with an average rating of 6.3/10 based on 22 reviews for Season 1. The website's consensus reads, \"Nathan Fillion's reliably likable presence makes The Rookie worth tuning in, even if the show around him isn't particularly memorable.\"[66] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 64 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[67] On February 8, 2022, ABC ordered a pilot for a planned FBI spin-off of the series starring Niecy Nash. It was introduced in a two-episode backdoor pilot during Season 4.[87] On March 9, 2022, Kat Foster and Felix Solis joined the cast of the spin-off.[88] Also that month, Frankie Faison joined the cast.[28] On May 13, 2022, ABC gave a series order under the title The Rookie: Feds.[89] It was then reported that the series had undergone creative tweaks that cut Foster's character, Special Agent Casey Fox.[90] In June 2022, Britt Robertson, Kevin Zegers and James Lesure joined the cast as series regulars.[91][92][93] The Rookie: Feds aired from September 27, 2022 to May 2, 2023.[39] It was canceled on November 9, 2023, after one season as a consequence of the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.[94] On December 5, 2024, it was reported that a second spin-off series was in development.[95] The series would be set in Washington state and center around a \"male cop who is stepping into a new phase of life in his second act\".[96] Created by Hawley, he, Fillion, Norcross, and Chapman would serve as executive producers. The series will be co-produced by Lionsgate Television and 20th Television.[97]",

                "title": "Jerry Springer - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Gerald Norman Springer (February 13, 1944 – April 27, 2023) was an American broadcaster, journalist, actor, lawyer, and politician.[1] He was best known for hosting the controversial tabloid talk show Jerry Springer from 1991 to 2018. Springer was noted as a pioneer in the emergence of \"trash TV\"; his eponymous show was a \"commercial smash and certifiable cultural phenomenon\" in the 1990s.[2] Born in London during World War II to Jewish refugees escaping the Holocaust, Springer was raised in Queens, New York City. He attended Northwestern University School of Law, qualified as a lawyer, and first became actively involved in politics working for the campaign of Robert Kennedy in 1968. A Cincinnati City Council member, Springer served as the 56th Mayor of Cincinnati from 1977 to 1978. He then worked as a local news anchor in Cincinnati where he won ten Regional Emmy Awards for commentary. From 2005 to 2006, Springer hosted Springer on the Radio, a liberal talk show on Cincinnati's WCKY-AM. He was the host of the television talent show America's Got Talent from 2007 to 2008, and of the television courtroom show Judge Jerry from 2019 to 2022. He also hosted The Jerry Springer Podcast from 2015 to 2022. One year after he retired from his television career, Springer died of pancreatic cancer on April 27, 2023 at the age of 79.[3][4] Gerald Norman Springer was born on February 13, 1944,[5] in the London Underground's Highgate station while the station was in use as a shelter from German bombing during World War II.[6][7] Springer spent his first years living on Chandos Road, East Finchley.[8] His parents, Margot (née Kallmann; a bank clerk) and Richard Springer (owner of a shoe shop), were Jewish refugees who escaped from Landsberg an der Warthe, Prussia (now Gorzów Wielkopolski, Poland).[9][10] His maternal grandmother, Marie Kallmann, was killed in the gas vans of Chełmno extermination camp in German-occupied Poland.[8] His paternal grandmother, Selma Springer (née Elkeles), died at the hospital in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in German-occupied Czechoslovakia.[8] Selma Springer's brother, Hermann Elkeles, was a renowned Berlin doctor who also died at Theresienstadt concentration camp.[11] In January 1949, when Springer was five,[12] his family immigrated to the United States, settling in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, a borough of New York City. He attended nearby Forest Hills High School. One of his earliest memories about current events was when he was 12 and watching the 1956 Democratic National Convention on television where he saw and was impressed by then-Senator John F. Kennedy.[13][14] Springer earned a Bachelor of Arts from Tulane University in 1965, majoring in political science.[15] He earned a Juris Doctor from Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law in 1968.[10][16] Springer worked as a political campaign adviser to Democrat Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.[16] Following Kennedy's assassination, he began practicing law at the Cincinnati law firm of Frost & Jacobs, now Frost Brown Todd.[17][18] Springer was a partner in the law firm of Grinker, Sudman & Springer from 1973 to 1985,[19] alongside former NBA agent Ronnie Grinker (d. 1997) and current Butler County, Ohio, magistrate Harry Sudman.[20] In 1970, Springer ran for the United States House of Representatives. He failed to unseat incumbent Republican Donald D. Clancy, but took 45% of the vote in a traditionally Republican district. He had previously spearheaded the effort to lower the voting age, including testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of ratification of the 26th Amendment. Three days after announcing his candidacy, Springer, who was also an Army reservist at the time, was called to active duty and stationed at Fort Knox. He resumed his campaign after he was discharged.[21] Springer was elected to the Cincinnati City Council in 1971.[16] On April 29, 1974, Springer resigned from the council after admitting to soliciting a prostitute.[16][22] He ran for the office in 1975, winning by a landslide.[23][24] He was reelected in 1977 and 1979.[25] Springer was considered a \"gonzo\" type politician with stunts such as staying a night in jail and commandeering a bus after the city took over bus service.[26] In 1977, Springer was chosen by the Cincinnati City Council to serve for one year as mayor.[16] In 1981, Springer stepped down from his seat on the City Council to focus on running for governor of Ohio,[27] seeking the Democratic nomination in the 1982 Ohio gubernatorial election. Television commercials for Springer's campaign referenced his use of a check to pay a prostitute, saying that he was not afraid of the truth \"even if it hurts.\"[28][29] He failed to win the Democratic party's nomination—finishing a distant third behind former lieutenant governor Richard F. Celeste and Ohio Attorney General William J. Brown—and his political career was put on hold.[30] In the late 1980s, he played a major role in saving the historic Cincinnati Union Terminal.[30] Springer considered running for the United States Senate in 2000[31] and 2004,[32] but he backed down due to negative associations with the Jerry Springer talk show.[33] He also considered running in the 2018 Ohio gubernatorial election, but decided against it due to his age.[34] Even after his departure from politics, he was the largest contributor to the Hamilton County Democratic Party from 1993 to 2018.[26] In 2016, Springer voiced support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election.[35] Springer was hired as a political reporter and commentator on Cincinnati's NBC affiliate, WLWT, which had, at the time, the lowest-rated news program. Later, having been named primary news anchor and managing editor, he needed a broadcast catchphrase in the model of other great newsmen. With the help of some others at WLWT, he created his signature line: \"Take care of yourself, and each other.\" Within two years he was Cincinnati's number-one news anchor, along with partner Norma Rashid. For five years, he was the most popular news anchor in the city,[16] garnering ten local Emmy Awards for his nightly commentaries, which were frequently satirized by Cincinnati radio personality Gary Burbank. Those commentaries would eventually become his \"Final Thought\" on Jerry Springer. Springer would remain commentator at WLWT until January 1993. He resided in Loveland, Ohio, during this time.[36] In 1997, the Chicago-based NBC-owned station WMAQ-TV hired Springer to serve as a news commentator. However, this proved to be unpopular among viewers, as it resulted in the resignation of long-time news anchors Ron Magers and Carol Marin due to Springer's talk show. After performing only two commentaries, Springer resigned as commentator.[37][38] Jerry Springer debuted on September 30, 1991.[39] It started as a politically oriented talk show, a longer version of Springer's commentaries. Guests on the show included Oliver North and Jesse Jackson, and topics included homelessness and gun politics.[40][41][42] In early 1994, Springer and his new producer, Richard Dominick, revamped the show's format to garner higher ratings. The show became more successful as it became targeted toward tabloidish sensationalism.[43] Guests were everyday people confronted on a television stage by a spouse or family member's adultery, homosexuality, transsexuality, prostitution, transvestism, hate group membership, or other controversial situations.[43] These confrontations were often promoted by scripted shouting or violence on stage. The show received substantial ratings and much attention.[43] By 1998, it was beating The Oprah Winfrey Show in many cities, and was reaching around 8 million viewers.[44] On July 10, 2002, the sons of guest Nancy Campbell-Panitz – who was murdered by her ex-husband after they appeared on a May 2000 episode with his girlfriend – filed suit in Sarasota County against Springer, his producers, and his distributor, claiming he created \"a mood that led to murder\".[45] Ultimately, the estate of Campbell-Panitz dropped all monetary claims against Jerry Springer and the show agreed to waive its claims for malicious prosecution against the personal representative of the estate of Campbell-Panitz and his counsel.[46] The British musical, Jerry Springer: The Opera was inspired by him and his talk show. For the New York City performances of the work at Carnegie Hall his character was portrayed by Harvey Keitel. The show won four Olivier awards for its run on London's West End.[47] In 2005, a UK version of the show aired on Britain's ITV network titled The Springer Show. A subdued and more tongue-in-cheek version of the US show, it beat its talk-show rival Trisha Goddard five to one in the ratings.[48] The VH1 \"celebreality\" series The Springer Hustle, which took a look at how Jerry Springer is produced, premiered in April 2007.[49] In April 2015, Springer debuted The Jerry Springer Podcast on his website, JerrySpringer.com.[50] He later partnered with Westwood One to stream the podcast.[51] It was also broadcast in the UK on Talkradio, on Sundays at midnight.

He was a savvy politician, pop cultural icon, and devout and loyal friend who was most proud when he spoke up for the marginalized and unrepresented. He connected equally with both the powerful and the man on the street. Strangers would open up to him and he loved nothing more than to give them a voice. We deeply mourn his loss and are fortunate to have been partners in a career that was truly astounding and a life that emulated the very best of us. “The Jerry Springer Show” was produced by NBCUniversal Syndication Studios and ran for 27 seasons.

(Mike Krzyzewski) is just the most legendary coach that ever coached college basketball. I feel like going to Duke University, I can learn a lot from him.\"[43] Duke, who had landed RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish in addition to Williamson, became the first team to land the top three recruits in a class since modern recruiting rankings began.[44] Williamson's stepfather, Lee Anderson, remarked that Clemson lost a \"mile-and-a-half lead\" in recruiting Williamson.[45] Sources: On November 6, 2018, in his first regular season game with Duke, Williamson scored 28 points on 11-of-13 shooting in 23 minutes in a 118–84 win over Kentucky at the Champions Classic.[46] In that game, he and teammate RJ Barrett each broke the Duke freshman debut scoring record set by Marvin Bagley III.[47] In his following game, a 94–72 victory over Army, Williamson tallied 27 points, 16 rebounds, and six blocks.[48] He became the second player in school history to record at least 25 points, 15 rebounds, and 5 blocks in a game.[49] Williamson was subsequently named both player and freshman of the week in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).[49] On January 5, 2019, he had another strong performance versus Clemson, with 25 points, 10 rebounds, and a 360-degree dunk in 22 minutes.[50] Two days later, Williamson earned ACC Freshman of the Week honors for a second time.[51] On January 12, against Florida State, he was poked in the left eye by an opposing player towards the second half and missed the remainder of the game.[52] Williamson returned in Duke's next game, a 95–91 overtime loss to Syracuse, and erupted for 35 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 blocks.[53] He eclipsed the Duke freshman record for single-game points previously held by Marvin Bagley III and JJ Redick.[54] On January 21, Williamson collected his third ACC Freshman of the Week accolade.[55] One week later, he scored 26 points and grabbed 9 rebounds in an 81–63 victory over Notre Dame.[56] By recording nine 25-point games in the season, Williamson set a new Duke freshman record.[57] On February 4, 2019, Williamson was named ACC Freshman of the Week on his fourth occasion, while earning a National Player of the Week distinction from the Naismith Trophy.[58] He had his third 30-point game of the season on February 16, scoring 32 points in a 94–78 victory over NC State.[59] The performance helped him claim his second ACC Player of the Week and fifth ACC Freshman of the Week accolades.[60] In a February 20 game versus North Carolina, Williamson suffered a Grade 1 knee sprain 36 seconds into the contest after his foot ripped through his Nike shoe, causing him to slip.[61][62] He did not return to the game, which Duke lost, 88–72.[63] Nike saw the value of its stock drop by $1.1 billion the following day as a result of the incident.[64][65] The injury resulted in criticism of the NCAA for not paying student-athletes.[66][67][68] Williamson was held out from the final six games of the regular season.[69] When the regular season concluded, Williamson earned Player of the Year and Rookie of the Year honors in the ACC, joining former Duke players Jahlil Okafor and Marvin Bagley III as the only recipients of both awards.

He ranked first among all rookies in points per game, second in rebounds per game and first in offensive rebounds per game. He became the first rookie since Michael Jordan to post 16 20-point games within their first 20 contests while also logging the highest scoring average through his first 24 career NBA games since Jordan in 1983.[96] On September 15, Williamson was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.[96][97][98] On February 12, 2021, Williamson scored a then career high 36 points in a 143–130 defeat against the Dallas Mavericks; he finished the game on 14-of-15 shooting from the field, making him the youngest player in NBA history with 30 points on 90 percent shooting.[99] On February 23, 2021, Williamson was selected into his first NBA All-Star Game.[2] On March 21, 2021, Williamson scored 30 points and 6 rebounds in a 113–108 win over the Denver Nuggets.[100] During the season, Williamson tied Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record for the longest streak of at least 20-point games on 50-percent shooting within his first two seasons since the shot clock era in 1954–55. The streak eventually grew to 25 consecutive games, surpassing Hall-of-Famers Wilt Chamberlain and Karl Malone[101][102] while tying Shaquille O'Neal's record of 25 consecutive such games,[103] with no other player having had a longer streak since the three-point era in 1980; his streak of 20-points games on 50-percent shooting and attempt to surpass O'Neal's record ended in a 139–111 loss to the Brooklyn Nets on April 7.[104] During the off-season, Williamson suffered a Jones fracture in his right foot and underwent a subsequent surgery. In late-September, team officials were hopeful that he would be ready to return by the start of the season.[105] By mid-October, the timeline for his expected return was extended until December.[106] In mid-December, it was announced that the injury was slow to heal and he would most likely be out another four to six weeks with a possible return to action around the all-star break.[107] In mid-March, it was announced that Williamson would not play that season.[108] On July 6, 2022, Williamson signed a five-year rookie extension with the New Orleans Pelicans worth $193 million guaranteed, increasing to $231 million if he made an All-NBA team in the 2022–2023 season.[109] Williamson made his return from injury on October 4, 2022, putting up 13 points, four rebounds, one assist, and one steal in a 129–125 preseason win over the Chicago Bulls.[110] On October 19, Williamson made his regular season return, putting up 25 points, nine rebounds, three assists, and four steals in a 130–108 win over the Brooklyn Nets.[111] On December 2, Williamson scored 30 points and matched career highs with 15 rebounds and eight assists in an 117–99 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[112] On December 9, Zion put up a then season-high 35 points, along with seven rebounds, four steals, and one block in a 126–117 win against the Phoenix Suns. A final dunk he made in the last seconds of the game caused an altercation between the Pelicans and Suns.[113] On December 12, Williamson was named the NBA Western Conference Player of the Week for Week 8 (December 5–11), his first NBA Player of the Week award. He led New Orleans to an undefeated 3–0 week with averages of 33.0 points and 8.3 rebounds on 70.4% shooting from the field.[114] On December 28, Williamson put up a career-high 43 points in a 119–118 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.[115] Williamson was sidelined on January 2, 2023, with a hamstring injury. At first, team officials were hopeful that he would be ready to return by the end of January.[116] On January 26, 2023, Williamson was selected for his second NBA All-Star appearance.[117] However, due to his unavailability, Williamson was replaced by Anthony Edwards.[118] On February 13, team officials indicated that Williamson would miss multiple weeks after the All-Star break.[119] Subsequently, team officials confirmed in early April that Williamson would miss the remainder of the regular season.[120] Subsequently, Williamson sat out the Pelicans appearance in their play-in game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, which New Orleans lost, ending their season.[121] On November 29, 2023, Wiliamson recorded 33 points on 11-of-12 shooting from the field, 11-of-12 from the free throw line along with eight rebounds, six assists, and three steals in a 124–114 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.[122] On February 2, 2024, Williamson put up 33 points, eight rebounds, and a game-winning layup in a 114–113 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[123] On April 16, Wiliamson in his first play-in appearance scored 40 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and dished out 5 assists in a 110–106 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers. His NBA postseason debut was cut short by an injury in the final minutes of the game.[124] Williamson is listed at 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall and weighs 284 pounds (129 kg).[125][126] Despite his heavy weight for a basketball player, he is known for his speed and leaping ability.[127][128] NBA player Kevin Durant described him as a \"once-in-a-generation type athlete\" while an anonymous college basketball coach labeled him a \"freak of nature.\"[129][130] Williamson plays the power forward position but is also capable of being a small-ball center.[131] He has been described as not fitting a specific basketball position.[132] His physical attributes have drawn comparisons to former NBA stars Charles Barkley, Anthony Mason, and Larry Johnson.[133][134] In addition, according to different analysts, he resembles NBA players LeBron James and Julius Randle.[132] Lee Sartor, Williamson's high school coach, reported that basketball coach Roy Williams told Williamson \"that he was probably one of the best high school players he's seen since Michael Jordan.\"[135] Williamson, who is left-handed, is almost ambidextrous.[132] While in high school, Williamson drew national attention for his slam dunks.[136] The Charlotte Observer remarked that he \"could be the best high-school dunker in history.\"[137] NBA point guard John Wall has likened Williamson's in-game dunking ability to that of Vince Carter.[138] Williamson's outside shooting has been considered a point of concern, and he has unorthodox shot mechanics.[4][9][139] Recruiting service 247Sports has praised his ball handling and passing skills for his size, commenting that they are \"overshadowed by [his] athletic plays.\"[140] Williamson has the ability to defend multiple positions well due to his speed and length, although his defensive effort has been questioned.[141] He is a skilled shot-blocker and rebounder.[142] At various points during his NBA career, Williamson has received criticism in the media from basketball observers who perceive him to be overweight.[143][144][145][146] Prior to the start of the 2021–2022 season, Williamson's weight increased to over 300 lbs.[145] Williamson lost weight in 2022.[147] In 2023, however, retired basketball players Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal each expressed concerns about Williamson's weight.[148][149] Williamson's 2022 contract extension with the New Orleans Pelicans provides for salary reductions in the event that Williamson fails to maintain his weight and body fat percentage at specified levels.[150] Since the inaugural In-Season Tournament during the 2023 season, Williamson has seen significant improvements to his physique, losing 25 lbs.[151] On July 23, 2019, Williamson signed a five-year, $75 million shoe deal with Jordan brand.[152] Williamson's deal is the second-largest rookie shoe deal in history, trailing only LeBron James's $90 million rookie deal signed in 2003.[153] On March 13, 2020, Williamson pledged to pay for the salaries of all the employees of the Smoothie King Center for 30 days during the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, which was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. He was one of several basketball players to help the arena workers.[154] In June 2023, Williamson announced his girlfriend's pregnancy in a baby shower YouTube video with the couple expecting a daughter due in November.[155] This announcement led adult film star Moriah Mills to claim on Twitter that she had a recent affair with Williamson.[156]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Zion Williamson made his return for the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday after a 27-game absence with a bum hamstring. He looked great. For starters, he clearly kept himself in shape while he was out, which is no small matter after two months of relative inactivity. He could have ballooned. He didn't. In fact, he appeared to be about as slim as he's looked in a long time, and it showed in his bounce and overall athleticism. The Pelicans lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves, 107-97, but who cares. Now 7-30, New Orleans' season is over at this point. Two things matter more than anything else between now and April: Can the Pelicans find a trade for Brandon Ingram, and can Williamson stay healthy the rest of the way and reinstall some organizational confidence that he's a player to continue to building around? With Williamson, the ability is abundantly obvious. He finished with 22 points, six rebounds, four assists and three steals on 9-of-15 shooting. The Pelicans were plus-8 in his 28 minutes. Williamson is still nearly impossible to keep from getting to his left hand. His downhill force when he does so is practically unstoppable. He pushed in transition and still jumps out of the gym, as evidenced by blocking a Rudy Gobert shot at its peak, ripping down an in-traffic offensive rebound and scoring the put-back for his first bucket, and this 50-foot alley-oop dunk in the first quarter. A healthy Zion is still so special pic.twitter.com/5j6Svgaytg Then there was this 360 piece on one of his three steals later on. ZION 360 WINDMILL COME ON NOW 🤯🤯 pic.twitter.com/hGuQ1R7FjW Here's a full look at Williamson's highlights: So Williamson's shape and performance are the good news. The bad news is we've seen this story before, and to this point it has just never resulted in anything substantial for the Pelicans. It hasn't always been on account of Williamson's inconsistent health; there have been other injuries at terrible times. But Williamson is the franchise in New Orleans and the simple truth is the franchise is failing. It's failing to the point, in fact, that trading Williamson has become a legitimate topic of conversation. And one of main reasons it's not an even hotter topic is nobody is quite sure what anyone would even give up to get him, which is really saying something for player of such tremendous and unique abilities. Every time Williamson puts together a decent streak of health, like when he played 70 games last season, he ends up hurt, like when he was dominating the Lakers in last year's play-in game until he tore his hamstring in the fourth quarter and that was the end of that. This is the seventh game he's played this season. It's January, if you haven't noticed. So once again, New Orleans will get its hopes up with the way Williamson played on Tuesday night, but the sad fact is we are simply back at the beginning at the depressing cycle of Zion. He plays great, gets hurt, sits out, comes back strong, everyone gets excited, then he goes down again. Everyone will continue to hope that somehow this is the time the cycle ends because Williamson is so electric and the Pelicans and the league at large benefit so much from him being on the court and in top shape. But I wouldn't bet much on that being the case. There is just too much evidence suggesting this will be another short-lived stint of health, so let's enjoy it while we can. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "The Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball team is the collegiate men's basketball program for the University of Tennessee–Knoxville. The Volunteers (commonly referred to as the \"Vols\") compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Volunteers play their home games in Thompson–Boling Arena, on a court nicknamed \"the Summitt\", after former Tennessee Lady Vols basketball coach Pat Summitt. With a current capacity of 21,678 (formerly 24,535), Tennessee has consistently ranked in the top 15 in the nation in terms of volume of attendance, averaging 14,817 (60.39% capacity) attendance from 1988 through 2006, and averaging 17,194 (79.34% capacity) attendance from 2007 through 2018 after reducing seating capacity prior to the 2007 season.[2][3] Historically, Tennessee ranks third in the SEC in all-time wins.[4] Many notable players have played collegiately at Tennessee—players such as Bernard King, Dale Ellis, Allan Houston, Tobias Harris, Grant Williams, and Dalton Knecht who all play(ed) in the NBA. Chris Lofton, Ron Slay, Tyler Smith, and John Fulkerson are also notable players who later played professionally in other leagues. The Volunteers are currently coached by Rick Barnes, who was hired on March 31, 2015, to replace Donnie Tyndall. In 1963, the University of Tennessee hired Ray Mears to become the head coach of the men's basketball program. The hiring of Mears, who was coming off an NCAA small college championship at Wittenberg University, ushered in the most sustained period of success in Tennessee men's basketball history. In his first year, Mears's Volunteers improved from a 4–19 record in 1962 to 13–11, highlighted by two wins over the Kentucky Wildcats. Before Mears, Tennessee had only beaten the Wildcats twice in 39 meetings. Throughout his career, Mears gained notoriety throughout the SEC for frequently being a thorn in the powerhouse Kentucky's side.[citation needed] In an era where Kentucky was coached by future College Basketball Hall of Fame members Adolph Rupp and Joe B. Hall, winning 75% of their games, Mears recorded a 15–15 record against the Wildcats. Led by A. W. Davis, the Volunteers finished second in the SEC in each of the next two seasons and recorded 20 wins in 1965, reaching that mark for the first time in 17 years. This success and the resultant growing fan support led to the university's decision to expand the 7,500-seat Amory-Fieldhouse to 12,700 seats. It was renamed Stokely Athletic Center to honor William B. Stokely, whose donation funded the renovation. In the expanded Stokely Center's inaugural season, the Volunteers captured the 1967 SEC championship and made the program's first-ever NCAA tournament appearance. Dubbed the \"Fearless Five,\" the 1967 team won road games against top conference teams Florida, Kentucky, and Mississippi State. The win over Mississippi State, coming in double-overtime on a pair of Bill Justus free throws, secured Tennessee's first SEC championship in 24 years and is referred to by some as the greatest basketball game in Tennessee history.[citation needed] From 1968 to 1973, Mears kept Tennessee among the top teams of the SEC, winning a second SEC championship in 1972 and finishing second in every year except 1970. In 1974, Mears and his trusted assistant Stu Aberdeen were able to recruit New York City standout forward Ernie Grunfeld to Knoxville. In his freshman season, Grunfeld led the team in scoring, averaging 17.4 points per game, and received first-team All-SEC honors. The following season, Grunfeld was joined by fellow New Yorker Bernard King. Known as \"The Ernie and Bernie Show,\" King and Grunfeld led the Volunteers to a 61–20 record over three years and an SEC championship in 1977. During their three years together, Tennessee posted a 5–1 record against Kentucky. The Volunteers reached the National Invitation Tournament in 1975 and the NCAA tournament in 1976 and 1977. King was named first-team All-American and SEC Player of the Year in 1975 and 1976, and then shared the honor with Grunfeld in 1977, with both being named SEC Co-Player of the Year. Grunfeld graduated from Tennessee in 1977 and King chose to forgo his senior year to enter the NBA draft. King was drafted 7th overall to the New Jersey Nets and Grunfeld went 11th overall to the Milwaukee Bucks. Both enjoyed long and illustrious NBA careers. Perhaps the biggest impact of the \"Ernie and Bernie\" show was how it changed the national perception of the Tennessee basketball program.[citation needed] This \"Double Trouble from Tennessee\" was featured in the February 1976 edition of Sports Illustrated.[5] In 2013, ESPN premiered a 30 for 30 documentary called \"Bernie and Ernie\" about the all-time great Volunteer basketball players. Following the exit of his two biggest stars, Mears, who long struggled with depression,[6] was not able to coach the team in 1978. Under the watch of interim coach Cliff Wettig, the Volunteers struggled to an 11–16 record, and Mears officially retired for health reasons after the season.[7] Mears is remembered not only as the greatest coach in Tennessee men's basketball history, but also as a great entertainer and marketer.[citation needed] From the beginning of his time at Tennessee, Mears employed marketing tactics to get fans to games—from his patented and provocative orange blazer, to his introduction of the Pride of the Southland Band to basketball games, to his entertaining pre-game warmups that compared to the Harlem Globetrotters for creativity.[8] At the beginning of his tenure, Mears declared, \"This is Big Orange Country,\" and this slogan has lived on long past his coaching years.[9] Don DeVoe was named Mears's successor and took over as head coach for the 1979 season. Despite the losing record in 1978, DeVoe inherited a roster centered on All-American center Reggie Johnson. DeVoe's 1979 Volunteers finished the regular season with a 21–12 record, beating Kentucky twice and earning a second-place finish in the SEC. The 1979 SEC tournament was the first held in 27 years, and the Volunteers reached the tournament finals, where they once again defeated Kentucky by a score of 75–69 to win their first SEC Tournament championship since 1943. With the tournament championship win, the Volunteers were invited back to the NCAA tournament, where they recorded the program's first NCAA tournament win with a defeat of Eastern Kentucky. Tennessee was eliminated in the second round with a loss to Notre Dame. DeVoe led Tennessee to the NCAA tournament each of the next five years, but none of his teams advanced past the second round. Through his first seven years at UT, DeVoe compiled an overall record of 143–79 (.644). The program's momentum under his direction eventually weakened, however, and the Volunteers were not invited to the NCAA tournament or the NIT in 1986 or 1987. Entering the 1989 season, DeVoe's 11th year at Tennessee, his teams had not reached the NCAA tournament or finished above 6th in the SEC since 1983. DeVoe led the Volunteers to a 19–11 record and a berth in the NCAA tournament. After an 84–68 loss to West Virginia in the first round, DeVoe resigned. The growth of UT basketball under DeVoe is still seen today in the Vols' current home arena, Thompson–Boling Arena, which was built during his tenure. By the mid-1980s, the overflow crowds had grown too large for the 12,700-seat Stokley Athletic Center. In 1988, the Volunteers moved to the new $30 million Thompson–Boling Arena, which seated over 24,500 people—at the time, the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States. Sitting on the banks of the Tennessee River nearby historic Neyland Stadium, the arena has accommodated 21,678 people since a 2007 renovation. In 1990, Wade Houston, an Alcoa, Tennessee native and former assistant coach at Louisville, became the first African-American head coach in Tennessee and SEC history. Houston's son, Allan Houston, came to UT to play for his father and would become one of the most accomplished players in Tennessee history. With 2801 points, Allan Houston finished his career as Tennessee's all-time leading scorer and was named All-American in 1992 and 1993. Houston was fired after a 5–22 campaign in 1994, finishing the worst season in Tennessee history. None of his teams reached the NCAA tournament, and only two of his teams received invitations to the NIT, the two of which were also his only teams to finish with winning records. Houston finished with an overall record of 65–90 at Tennessee. Houston was replaced by Kevin O'Neill in 1995. O'Neill—an intense and somewhat high-strung sideline coach, but also a skilled recruiter[citation needed]—took over a program depleted in talent. He was able to sign talented players such as Brandon Wharton, Tony Harris, and Isiah Victor. O'Neill left Tennessee to become the head coach at Northwestern after the 1997 season. O'Neill was replaced by Oregon Ducks head coach Jerry Green. Green inherited a roster with significant young talent and was able to an immediate improvement in on-court success. His first Tennessee team produced a 20–9 overall record—a nine-win improvement over the 11–16 record of O'Neill's third and final UT team—and advanced to the 1998 NCAA tournament. In his second year, Green's Volunteers won the 1999 SEC East Division championship and defeated Kentucky twice in the same season for the first time since 1979, in what is generally regarded to be the best overall year in school athletics history. (The 1998 Tennessee Football team finished 13–0 and won the first-ever BCS National Championship. In women's basketball, Pat Summitt led the Lady Volunteers to a 39–0 NCAA championship season, the program's third consecutive national title.) The 2000 Tennessee men's basketball team finished 26–7, repeating as SEC East champions, winning the Volunteers' first SEC championship since 1982, and setting a program record for most wins in a single season. In the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers advanced to the first Sweet Sixteen in school history, where they lost a close contest to North Carolina. Green's Volunteers began the 2001 season with a 16–1 record, rising to No. 4 in the AP Poll. Beginning with a ten-point loss at Kentucky in mid-January, Tennessee then struggled to a 22–11 finish. Green's team advanced to the NCAA tournament—the fourth appearance in Green's four seasons—losing in the first round. Coupled with his multiple incidents with local media and Tennessee fans,[10] this disappointing finish to the season led to Green's resignation. He was replaced by Buzz Peterson, who failed to lead the program to an NCAA tournament berth in his four years as head coach. He was fired after the 2005 season, in which his team finished 14–17. After taking Wisconsin–Milwaukee to a Sweet Sixteen in 2005, Bruce Pearl was hired as the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Pearl's assistants Tony Jones, Steve Forbes, Jacob Nichols, Jason Shay, and Ken Johnson were part of a staff that would help to lead the Volunteers to the NCAA tournament six years in a row. Pearl inherited a roster that had not experienced much winning, but showed promise with future NBA senior point guard C. J. Watson and All-SEC freshman team shooting guard Chris Lofton. Pearl's coaching, which included playing an up-tempo style and pressing defense, led to immediate gains for Tennessee. In his first season, Pearl led the Volunteers to a 22–8 record, an SEC East Division championship, and a no. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Pearl's first team achieved some of the more memorable wins in program history, including two wins against the eventual national champion Florida Gators. Another memorable win came when Chris Lofton, who is a Kentucky native, led the Volunteers over Kentucky in Rupp Arena for the program's first win there since 1999. Pearl's 2006 recruiting class was ranked among the top ten in college basketball.[11] Despite the influx of freshmen and their inexperience, the Volunteers were able to open with a 13–2 start to the season. All-American guard Chris Lofton was injured and missed a good portion of January and early February, during which time the Volunteers opened 3–5 in SEC play. After Lofton returned, Tennessee won 7 out of their last 8 regular season games. Given a no. 5 seed, the Volunteers returned to the Sweet Sixteen where they faced no. 1 seed Ohio State. Tennessee led 49–32 at halftime, but the eventual NCAA runner-up Buckeyes mounted a comeback to defeat the Volunteers by a score of 85–84. During the 2006–07 season, the Volunteers were ranked 4th nationally in attendance, with an average of 19,661 fans in Thompson–Boling Arena, which has a capacity of 21,758. This marked an increase in attendance of an average of 7,436 per game since Pearl arrived in March 2005.[citation needed] Preseason expectations for the Volunteers were high entering the 2008 season.[12] Chris Lofton was a preseason pick by some to win National Player of the Year, and he was joined by Tyler Smith, an All-Big Ten freshman transfer from Iowa. Senior guards JaJuan Smith and Jordan Howell, along with rising sophomores Wayne Chism and Ramar Smith, propelled the Volunteers to a preseason no. 7 ranking. The team posted a record of 28–3 in the regular season. The season was highlighted by the rivalry matchup between Tennessee and Memphis. John Calipari's Tigers were undefeated and ranked no. 1 and the Volunteers were no. 2. In front the largest TV audience to date to ever watch a game on ESPN, the two teams remained evenly matched for thirty-nine minutes. The Volunteers trailed 61–60 with 30 seconds left before Tyler Smith made a jump-shot to give UT the lead. The Volunteers added three free throws and took the contest by a score of 66–62. The following Monday, Tennessee was ranked no. 1 in polls for the first time in school history. The Volunteers finished the regular season as the outright SEC champions and the no. 1 seed for the SEC Tournament in Atlanta. The Volunteers won their first game to set up a semifinal matchup against Arkansas in the Georgia Dome. The night before the game, an EF2 tornado hit Downtown Atlanta, damaging the Georgia Dome and much of the surrounding area. Because of this, the tournament was nearly canceled but was ultimately moved to Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum. The Razorbacks were able to upset the Volunteers, denying them a place in the final and a shot at their first SEC Tournament championship in 30 years. The Volunteers received a no. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament. They advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, where they lost to the Louisville Cardinals men's basketball. Despite the disappointing ending, the 2008 season is remembered as one of the best in program history. Replacing Chris Lofton proved a difficult task in the 2009 season. Now led by Tyler Smith, the Volunteers finished with a 21–13 record. However, Tennessee claimed another SEC division championship. The Volunteers advanced to the SEC Tournament Championship in Tampa before losing to Mississippi State 64–61. The Volunteers lost their NCAA tournament first-round game to Oklahoma State. Entering the regular season ranked in the top 10, the Volunteers started the season 10–2. On New Year's Day, players Melvin Goins, Cam Tatum, Brian Williams, and leading scorer Tyler Smith were arrested after a traffic stop when police found marijuana and an illegal firearm.[13] The players were all suspended for multiple games and Tyler Smith was eventually dismissed from the team.[14] After the suspensions, the Volunteers were left with only six scholarship players. The Volunteers defeated Charlotte and then hosted no. 1 Kansas the next game. In front of a sellout crowd, the undermanned Volunteers defeated the Jayhawks 76–68. Tennessee cemented its lead with a shot clock-beating three-point shot with under a minute left by local freshman walk-on Skylar McBee, who entered the rotation due to the suspensions. Tennessee rode the momentum of the Kansas upset to a 23–7 regular season record. This included another upset of second-ranked Kentucky, which featured future NBA All-Stars John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins, as well as four other eventual NBA players. The Volunteers won 74–65 at home in front of a raucous crowd. The Wildcats were able to avenge the loss a week and half later in the SEC Tournament. As a no. 6 seed in a bracket featuring overall top seed Kansas, the Volunteers defeated a Steve Fisher-coached San Diego State team with Kawhi Leonard in the first round. No. 14 seed Ohio upset the no. 3 seed Georgetown Hoyas, setting up a matchup between the Volunteers and the Bobcats in the following round. After winning 83–68, Tennessee advanced to Bruce Pearl's third Sweet Sixteen in five years. In a rematch of the 2007 Sweet Sixteen, the Volunteers faced the Ohio State Buckeyes at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis. In a back and forth battle with the Evan Turner-led Buckeyes, Tennessee held a 76–73 lead with 13 seconds left. Turner missed a three-point shot, rebounded his own missed shot, and attempted a final three-point shot that was blocked by J. P. Prince, securing the Volunteers an appearance in the Elite Eight for the first time in program history. Tennessee faced Michigan State in the Elite Eight. After a fast start, the Vols sputtered in the second half and Michigan State was able to keep the game close. Down by one point with 11 seconds left, Tennessee's Scotty Hopson was set to attempt two free throws. He made the first but missed the second. With the score tied, Michigan State advanced the ball and was fouled on a fast break. Raymar Morgan made one of two free throws, and Michigan State was able to defeat Tennessee one game short of the Final Four. Tennessee opened the 2010–11 season with success, winning the Preseason NIT and rising as high as no. 7 in the national polls. In mid-December, the NCAA announced an investigation into Bruce Pearl for his role in a possible recruiting violation.[citation needed] SEC Commissioner Mike Slive suspended Pearl for the first half of the SEC season.[15] Tennessee faltered throughout the rest of the season to a 19–15 record. Tennessee appeared in the NCAA tournament for the sixth consecutive year under Pearl and faced Michigan in the opening round. The Volunteers were defeated 75–45 in what proved to be Pearl's last game. On March 21, 2011, the week after the loss, the university announced the firing of Pearl, based on Pearl's misconduct of lying to the NCAA in the ongoing investigation.[16] Pearl was eventually given a three-year show-cause penalty. On March 27, 2011, the University of Tennessee announced the hiring of Cuonzo Martin as the Volunteers' 18th head coach. Martin had spent the prior three seasons at Missouri State, where he compiled a record of 61–41. Martin was able to lead the Missouri State team from an 11–20 record and a last-place finish in the Missouri Valley Conference to a 26–9 record and a first-place conference finish. Martin took over a depleted roster with low expectations. After the departure of Tobias Harris following his freshman season, the Volunteers were picked to finish near the bottom of the SEC in 2011–12.[citation needed] With the emergence of Jordan McRae and Jeronne Maymon, and the mid-season addition of Jarnell Stokes, Martin took a team that had lost their top three—and seven of their top ten—contributors from the previous season to a second-place finish in the SEC, largely because of their tough defense and lack of turnovers. With an outside chance at the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers lost their first SEC tournament game to Ole Miss, ending their NCAA chances. They played in the NIT before losing in the second round. In 2012–13, the Volunteers started off slowly, posting an 11–10 record before finishing the regular season 8–1. UT was eliminated in the second round of the SEC Tournament and was left out of the NCAA tournament for the second straight year, finishing as one of the last teams out.[citation needed] Expectations were high heading into 2013–14 with a roster many felt could compete for a Sweet Sixteen appearance.[citation needed] However, the fans quickly grew vocally upset after another slow start of 16–11. A petition with thousands of signatures surfaced online for the firing of Cuonzo Martin and the re-hiring of Bruce Pearl, whose show-cause order was ending the next year.[citation needed] Whether the petition motivated the team or not, the Volunteers finished the season 5–1 and earned a place in the \"First Four\" round of the NCAA tournament. They defeated Iowa in the play-in game in Dayton, Ohio to move on to face the UMass Minutemen. Martin's Volunteers, who were the lower seed, were favored by many and easily defeated UMass. In one of the biggest upsets in tournament history, Mercer upset Duke, and the Volunteers went on to defeat Mercer to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. Tennessee then played Michigan in Indianapolis. In front of one of the largest crowds to witness a Sweet Sixteen game, the Volunteers' comeback fell short and UT lost to Michigan by a score of 73–71. Martin resigned from Tennessee and accepted the coaching job at California on April 15, 2014.[17] After a brief coaching search, Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart announced on April 21, 2014 that former Morehead State and Southern Mississippi head coach Donnie Tyndall would become the next head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers.[18] Tyndall inherited a roster that returned one contributing player from the previous year. Also, due to Jarnell Stokes's decision to enter the NBA draft and two other players transferring, Tyndall had to recruit and sign nearly one-third of the 2015 team's roster in less than a month. Under these circumstances, he led the 2015 team to a 16–16 record. After the season was over, Tennessee announced it was firing Tyndall with cause after it learned that he had lied to both UT and the NCAA about the severity of major NCAA violations that had occurred at Southern Miss.[19] Hart said that he would have never hired Tyndall had the true extent of the violations been known. By this time, it was clear that Tyndall would face severe penalties for his role in the violations, including a suspension for part of the season. According to ESPN, Hart and other officials were still smarting from Pearl having to sit out the first half of conference play three years earlier, and were not willing to face the prospect of an equally lengthy suspension for Tyndall.[20] While searching for its third basketball coach in four years, Tennessee sought to make a hire that would bring much-needed stability to the program.[citation needed] During the search process, news broke that Texas had fired their head coach of 17 years, Rick Barnes. Barnes, who had a prior connection to Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart, quickly surfaced as the frontrunner for the job.[citation needed] On March 31, 2015, Barnes was named the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Barnes boasts the best record of any coach in school history, with an overall record of 604–314 from his previous tenures at Texas, Clemson, and Providence. Barnes is originally from nearby Hickory, North Carolina, and his wife, Candy, graduated from Tennessee in 1975.[21] The Rick Barnes era began on a winning note as Tennessee defeated UNC Asheville, 82–78 in Barnes' debut game at UT. In Barnes' third year as Tennessee's coach he completed quite the turnaround from the previous year's 16–16 (8–10) team, as his team would finish the regular season 26–9 (13–5) and capture a share of the SEC regular season title. This would be Tennessee's first regular season title since 2008 and tenth overall.[22] Tennessee also reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Kentucky 77–72. In 2019, Tennessee experienced their best season record wise under Barnes. The Volunteers would earn a record of 31–6 (15–3) including an 18-game win streak and a no.1 ranking in the polls for the first time since the 2007–08 season. The Volunteers again reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Auburn 84–64. The Volunteers proceeded to earn a #2 seed in the 2019 NCAA tournament, where they defeated Colgate 77–70 in the first round.[23] Tennessee overcame a resurgent Iowa Hawkeyes team in the second round by a score of 83–77 in an overtime thriller. The Volunteers fell to Purdue in the Sweet Sixteen in overtime after a thrilling come-from-behind run led by Volunteer guard Admiral Schofield. Purdue's Ryan Cline kept the Boilermakers in the game late and after a controversial call on Lamonte Turner, the Vols lost. Junior forward Grant Williams captured the 2018–19 SEC player of the year award, his second consecutive year obtaining the honor.[24] Source[25][26][27] National champion Postseason invitational champion Conference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion Division regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion Conference tournament champion Tennessee plays its home games in Thompson–Boling Arena, which was at one time the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States, with a seating capacity of 24,678 until its 2007 renovation. Named for the late B. Ray Thompson and former UT President Dr. Edward J. Boling, the arena regularly hosts women's volleyball matches, concerts, camps, conferences, and other special events throughout the year. Thompson–Boling Arena opened during the 1987–88 season, with Tennessee defeating Marquette 82–56 before a crowd of 25,272. In its opening season, the Volunteers finished third nationally in attendance, with an average attendance of more than 20,000 fans per game. Much of the facility's storied history has centered on men's and women's basketball. In the last two decades, the Volunteers and Lady Volunteers have hosted record college basketball crowds, as well as WNBA and NCAA tournament basketball games. The Volunteers have ranked fourth in the nation in average home attendance for each of the past three seasons, including an average of 20,483 fans per game in 2008–09. Tennessee's 1989 men's game against Kentucky set the SEC regular-season record with a crowd of 25,610. The Lady Volunteers drew 24,597 fans for their 1998 game with Connecticut to establish a women's NCAA record, while a Celtics-Bullets game in 1988 attracted a then-NBA-record exhibition crowd of 23,611. The arena's largest basketball crowd since its capacity was reduced to 21,678 prior to the 2007–08 season came on January 7, 2009, when the Vols hosted Gonzaga in front of a sellout crowd of 22,326. UT hosted the NCAA tournament's South Regional Finals in 1994 and 1999 in the spacious facility, as well as the 1990 NCAA Southeast Region's first- and second-round games and the NCAA women's 1990 Final Four. The 1989 SEC Tournament was the first of what promised to be many postseason tournaments to be held in Thompson–Boling Arena. The riverfront arena has drawn rave reviews from teams, administrators, and media for its modern facilities needed for hosting major tournaments. The Volunteers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 26 times. Their combined record is 28–27. The Volunteers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 13 times. Their combined record is 13–13. †: First Team All-American Tennessee has retired five jersey numbers.[30][31][32][33][34]",

Before then, more than 300 years ago, Richmond's drinking water came from numerous springs and an open stream flowing from the Capitol across Main Street. Over the years the plant has been upgraded and enlarged to meet growing demand. Today, Richmond's Department of Public Utilities' (DPU) water plant can produce up to 132 million gallons per day (MGD). DPU also provides water to Henrico, Chesterfield, Hanover, Goochland and Powhatan counties through wholesale contracts. Details are outlined in the current water plan. DPU has invested millions of dollars to ensure it always meets or exceeds federal regulations as well as the increasing regional demands for reliable, high-quality drinking water. Water utility employees perform numerous water tests every day and maintain more than 1,200 miles of water lines so that when you turn on the tap, your family will receive water that is clean and safe. Explore the video to discover how clean and safe water is delivered to you. The City of Richmond Department of Public Utilities is a member of the American Water Works Association, the American Water Works Association Research Foundation, and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies. These organizations are dedicated to furthering knowledge and research on safe drinking water. Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some substances. The presence of substances does not necessarily indicate that the water poses a health risk. More information about substances and potential health effects may be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency ’s (EPA) Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791. Some people may be more vulnerable to certain substances in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised people - such as those with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy, those who have undergone organ transplants, those with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, and some elderly people and infants - can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice from their health care providers about drinking water. EPA/CDC (Centers for Disease Control) guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium and other microbial substances are available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791. The 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act requires water utilities to provide consumers with a yearly report on the source and quality of the water they drink. You may also find our Water Quality Reports on this page. The state allows us to monitor for some substances less than once per year because the concentrations of these substances do not change frequently. The Virginia Department of Health conducted a source water assessment of our system during 2002. The Richmond Water Treatment Plant was determined to be of high susceptibility to contamination, using criteria developed by the state in its EPA-approved Source Water Assessment Program. The assessment report consists of maps showing the source water assessment area, an inventory of known land use activities of concern, and documentation of any known contamination within the last five years from the date of assessment. This report is available by contacting the Department of Public Utilities at 646-5777. The water quality report is a snapshot of the city’s drinking water quality over the past year. Included is information about your water, what it contains and how it compares with standards mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Virginia Department of Health.

More information about substances and potential health effects may be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791. As water travels over land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material. Water can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or human activity. Substances that may be present in source water include: Water treatment significantly reduces the level of these substances in drinking water. In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations limit the amount of certain substances in water provided by public water systems. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations establish limits for substances in bottled water, which must provide the same protection for public health. If present, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Lead in drinking water is primarily from materials and components associated with service lines and home plumbing. The City of Richmond is responsible for providing high quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in plumbing components. When your water has been sitting for several hours, you can minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your tap for 15-30 seconds or until it becomes cold or reaches a steady temperature before using water for cooking or drinking. If you are concerned about lead in your water, you may wish to have your water tested. Information on lead in drinking water, testing materials, and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available from the Drinking Water Hotline. Crytosporidium is a microbial parasite found in surface water throughout the United States. We collected seven samples in 2017 and found an average of 5.4 Oocysts/100L. This is less than the Action Level of 7.5 Oocysts/100L. Contact the City of Richmond Department of Public Utilities at (804) 646-4646 for additional copies of the Water Quality Report.

                "content": "By 6 p.m. Tuesday, water still had not been restored in the city and even some surrounding counties were reporting problems. RICHMOND — Water outages that hit much of the city after a winter storm knocked out Richmond’s water supply continued into the evening Tuesday, with residents lining up for bottled water and waiting fruitlessly at empty taps. Capitol Square, normally swarmed with legislators and lobbyists on the eve of a new General Assembly session, was all but deserted throughout the day, with the Capitol and surrounding buildings shuttered as the city struggled to get its water supply back in service following Monday’s snowstorm. Shortly after noon Tuesday, the city said water production had restarted but would take several hours to build up enough supply to resume flowing to residents’ taps. By 7 p.m., though, the city reported that the failure of an electrical panel had caused an unexpected setback that would “extend the restoration process timeline.\" Mayor Danny Avula — who took office just a week ago — said that a boil-water advisory issued Monday by the city and state health departments would be in place for at least 16 hours after water service returns. With the late delay caused by the panel failure, the availability of flowing, drinkable water could push into Thursday. “I know this is a really challenging time to figure out how to operate without water,” Avula said early in the day. “But I ask for your continued patience.” As of 7 p.m. Tuesday, water still had not been restored in the city, and even some surrounding counties were reporting problems. Avula said in an evening news release that he was “disappointed” that the electrical failure had slowed the process and that he was bringing in local and national experts to advise. Despite icy streets, grocery stores endured a run on bottled water. Downtown on Tuesday, Devin Briggs, 31, struggled to lug eight gallons of water up to his apartment in two plastic bags. “Annoying” is how he summed up the situation, which had forced the bank employee to drive to a Hanover County Walmart to find water. The 7-Eleven on the first floor of his building had sold out the day before. “No cases, no bottles,” clerk Tara Culliton said from behind the counter, emptied of pizza slices and taquitos because staff lacked water to wash their hands to prepare the items. “We can’t even brew coffee.” The problem started Monday morning when a power outage caused by snow and ice hit the city’s main water facility. Dominion Energy said power was restored after about two hours, by a little after 9:30 a.m. Monday, but Avula said the outage caused a cascading effect. A pump failed and water surged into an area of electrical equipment, shorting out the computerized controls. Initially, Avula said, officials thought the primary reservoir had enough water to last until about 6 p.m., which would have given workers time to make repairs before residents were affected. Richmond worked with the surrounding counties of Henrico, Hanover and Chesterfield to remove customers there from the city system and onto their own backup supplies, he said. But high demand caused the system to drain faster than expected. By about 3 p.m., residents around the city of about 230,000 people experienced very low water pressure. Finally, a little after 4 p.m., the city issued an urgent advisory warning all residents to boil water before consuming it. At that time, though, much of the city had no water from its taps. Problems spread Tuesday afternoon, as eastern Henrico locations including Richmond International Airport reported low or no water flow, which county officials attributed to a broken water main compounded by issues related to the Richmond outage. The county declared a state of emergency and made water available at several locations where residents could fill containers. Officials in Hanover County issued a boil-water advisory Tuesday afternoon for the area east of Interstate 95, except Doswell, due to the outage. A spokesman for Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) said the governor spoke with Avula on Tuesday afternoon and that state agencies were coordinating with the city to alleviate the situation. “Our teams also worked overnight to supply area hospitals with tanker trucks of water and delivered nearly 70 pallets of water to the city with an additional 350 pallets en route for distribution,” Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez said. He added that Youngkin will continue to monitor the situation. Richmond’s schools are closed Wednesday due to the outage. The aftermath of the storm also continued to affect some D.C.-area schools — including those in Montgomery and Loudoun counties — which will be closed again Wednesday because of poor road conditions in parts of the region. So far, districts have not yet shifted to virtual learning because they built traditional snow days into school calendars. “The safety of our students and staff is our priority during inclement weather and its aftermath,” the Montgomery County Public Schools said in its announcement. “Our crews are working as quickly as possible to ready our schools for a return to learning.” Richmond’s water outage came just as state lawmakers from around Virginia were converging on Richmond for Opening Day of the General Assembly session, scheduled to begin at noon Wednesday. House Speaker Don Scott (D-Portsmouth) said he was “optimistic” that everything would be on schedule Wednesday. “Use the bathroom before you get there, we’re starting at noon,” Scott joked in a brief interview in the mid-afternoon. But Scott later announced that the House would quickly gavel in and out on Wednesday just to formally start the session, then reconvene Monday due to the water crisis. Senate Majority Leader Scott A. Surovell (D-Fairfax) said senators will do the same. In the meantime, lawmakers posted photos on social media of heating pans of snow on the stove to get water. Avula said the city was working to get water supplies to vulnerable populations, such as in shelters, hospitals and senior living centers. The Virginia Commonwealth University health system said that clinics would be closed. Elective surgeries as well as outpatient diagnostic testing and imaging at the VCU Medical Center, Children’s Hospital of Richmond and Stoney Point have been canceled and will be rescheduled, the hospital system posted on X. However, the VCU hospital and Children’s Hospital of Richmond emergency departments were open and seeing patients. Reporters questioned why the city waited so long to send out notice — after the point when many residents could do much to prepare. Avula said officials acted as quickly as they could in an unpredictable situation. “We really were trying to get things up and running yesterday so that we could avoid the boil-water advisory altogether,” Avula said. “I’m sorry that … we weren’t able to provide a little more buffer.” He said he had been with water treatment officials all through the night Monday into Tuesday. Equipment containing the computer brains of the system had been flooded and had to be opened up and dried out. The IT network finally came back online around midnight Tuesday, he said, but even then equipment would start and then stop. Once water is restored, officials will need at least 16 hours to test the supply to make sure it’s clean, meaning residents will have to continue boiling water for consumption.

                "content": "Robert Peter Williams (born 13 February 1974)[1] is an English singer and songwriter. He found fame as a member of the pop group Take That from 1990 to 1995, launching a solo career in 1996. His debut studio album, Life thru a Lens, was released in 1997, and included his best-selling single \"Angels\". His second album, I've Been Expecting You, featured the songs \"Millennium\" and \"She's the One\", his first and second number one singles. His discography includes seven UK No. 1 singles, and all but one of his 14 studio albums have reached No. 1 in the UK. Six of his albums are among the top 100 biggest-selling albums in the UK, with two of them in the top 60, and he gained a Guinness World Record in 2006 for selling 1.6 million tickets in a single day during his Close Encounters Tour.[2] Williams has received a record 18 Brit Awards, winning Best British Male Artist four times, Outstanding Contribution to Music twice, an Icon Award for his lasting impact on British culture, eight German ECHO Awards, and three MTV European Music Awards.[3][4] In 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame after being voted the Greatest Artist of the 1990s. According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), he has been certified for 20.36 million albums and 9.2 million singles in the UK as a solo artist.[5] Five of his albums have also topped the Australian albums chart, and has sold 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He also topped the 2000–2010 UK airplay chart. His three concerts at Knebworth in 2003 drew over 375,000 people, the UK's biggest music event to that point.[6] In 2014, he was awarded the freedom of his hometown of Stoke-on-Trent and had a tourist trail created and streets named in his honour. Williams' latest compilation album, XXV, was released on 9 September 2022.[7][8] After 15 years, Williams rejoined Take That in 2010 to co-write and perform lead vocals on their album Progress, which became the second-fastest-selling album in UK chart history[9] and the fastest-selling record of the century at the time.[10] The subsequent stadium tour, which featured seven songs from Williams' solo career, became the biggest-selling concert in UK history when it sold 1.34 million tickets in less than 24 hours. In 2011, Take That frontman Gary Barlow confirmed that Williams had left the band for a second time to focus on his solo career, although he stated that the departure was amicable and that Williams was welcome to rejoin Take That in the future.[11] Williams has since performed with Take That on three separate television appearances,[12][13][14] and collaborated with Barlow on a number of projects[15] such as the West End musical The Band.[16] Robert Peter Williams was born on 13 February 1974 in Stoke-on-Trent, the son of Janet (née Farrell) and Peter Williams (also known as Pete Conway), who ran a pub called the Red Lion in Burslem before becoming the licensee at the Port Vale Social Club.[17] His maternal grandfather was an Irishman from Kilkenny.[18] He attended St Margaret Ward Catholic School in Tunstall[19] and participated in several school plays, most notably in the role of the Artful Dodger in a production of Oliver![20] In 1990, the sixteen-year-old Williams was the youngest member to join Take That. According to the documentary Take That: For the Record, his mother read an advertisement seeking members for a new boy band and suggested that he try out for the group. He met fellow member Mark Owen on the day of his audition/interview with Nigel Martin-Smith. Although the majority of the group's material was written and performed by Gary Barlow, Williams performed lead vocals on their first Top Three hits \"Could It Be Magic\", \"I Found Heaven\", and \"Everything Changes\". Williams' use of alcohol and cocaine brought him into conflict with Martin-Smith over the behaviour rules for Take That members.[21] In November 1994, Williams's drug use had escalated; he nearly had a drug overdose the night before the group was scheduled to perform at the MTV Europe Music Awards.[22] According to the documentary For the Record, he was unhappy with his musical ideas not being taken seriously by Martin-Smith and lead singer Barlow; his desire to explore hip hop and rap conflicted with Take That's usual ballads. Barlow stated in interviews that Williams had given up trying to offer creative input. Noting Williams's increasingly belligerent behaviour and poor attendance at rehearsals, and worried that he might leave the group during their upcoming tour, Barlow and Jason Orange took their concerns to Martin-Smith. During one of the last rehearsals before the tour commenced, the three confronted Williams about his attitude and stated they wanted to do the tour without him. He agreed to quit and left the group in July 1995; it would be the last time for twelve years that they were all together. Despite the departure of Williams, Take That completed their Nobody Else Tour as a four-piece. They later disbanded on 13 February 1996, Williams's 22nd birthday.[23] Shortly afterwards, Williams was photographed by the press partying with the members of Oasis at Glastonbury Festival. Following his departure, he became the subject of talk shows and newspapers as he acknowledged his plans to become a solo singer, and he was spotted partying with George Michael in France. A clause in his Take That contract prohibited him from releasing any material until after the group was officially dissolved, and he was later sued by Martin-Smith and forced to pay $200,000 in commission. After various legal battles over his right to a solo career, Williams succeeded in getting released from his contract with BMG. On 27 June 1996, he signed with Chrysalis Records. By March 2009, Williams had shown interest in rejoining Take That;[24] the band completed their The Circus Live without him. In spite of rumours that Williams was working in New York with Take That in September that year,[25] by the day of the Children in Need charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall in November they were still performing separately. Both did join with the other acts in the final song of the evening, with Williams putting his arm around Gary Barlow and singing \"Hey Jude\". On 15 July 2010, Williams reconciled with his former colleagues and rejoined Take That. In November 2010 the Take That album Progress was released, becoming the fastest selling album since 2000 and the second fastest selling album in UK history.[26] The group travelled across the UK on their Progress Live tour, which included eight nights at Wembley Stadium in London,[27] then continued across Europe. The tour was the fastest selling in UK history with ticket hotlines and websites crashing under the demand.[27] In August 2012, Take That performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics. Williams was due to perform with Take That but missed the performance because his wife gave birth at around the same time; the group performed as a four-piece.[28] Although still officially part of Take That,[29] Williams chose not to return for group's seventh and eighth studio albums and their accompanying tours, focusing instead on his solo commitments. He continued to write music with his colleagues and has performed with the group on several occasions since 2011's Progress tour[30] and planned to return for a full tour to celebrate Take That's 30th anniversary in 2019.[31] Williams launched his solo career in 1996 with a cover of George Michael's \"Freedom\", which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart.[32] Recordings for Williams's first album began at London's Maison Rouge studios in March 1997. Shortly after his introduction to songwriter and producer Guy Chambers, Williams released \"Old Before I Die\", the first single from his debut album. The single reached number two on the UK Charts;[32] it was largely ignored on international charts. His debut album, Life thru a Lens, was released in September 1997. The album launched with his first live solo gig at the Élysée Montmartre theatre in Paris, France. The album debuted at number eleven on the UK Albums Chart. \"Angels\", the fourth single, is Williams' best-seller in the United Kingdom.[33] The song, apart from becoming a hit around Europe and Latin America, caused sales of his album to skyrocket. The album remained in the British top ten for forty weeks and spent 218 weeks there altogether, making it the 58th best selling album in UK history with sales of over 2.4 million.[34] The album eventually managed to sell over three million copies in Europe.[35] Williams and Chambers started writing the second album, I've Been Expecting You, in Jamaica in early 1998. The first single, \"Millennium\", accompanied with a music video featuring Williams parodying James Bond, complete with tuxedo and references to Bond films like Thunderball and From Russia with Love, became Williams' first solo number one single in the United Kingdom.[36] It also became a top twenty hit in many European countries, Latin America and Australia.[37] I've Been Expecting You was released in late October 1998 and debuted at number one in the UK Albums Chart.[36] The album received more attention outside the United Kingdom, leaving its mark in the European and Latin American markets with hits such as \"No Regrets\", a collaboration with the Pet Shop Boys' singer Neil Tennant and the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon. \"She's the One\", a cover of a World Party track written by Karl Wallinger, became Williams' second UK number-one single.[36] Williams finished the year with a European Tour late in 1999. I've Been Expecting You sold almost 3 million copies in the UK and was certified 10× Platinum by the BPI.[38] In Europe, the album sold over 4 million copies.[39] In 1999, Williams was signed to Capitol Records in the United States, a part of EMI. He embarked on a United States promotional tour and released his first United States and Canadian single, \"Millennium\". The compilation album The Ego Has Landed was released in July 1999 in the United States and Canada. In the middle of promotion and the tours in 1999, Williams began work on his third studio album. The first single taken from the album was \"Rock DJ\", a song inspired by Williams's UNICEF mentor, the late Ian Dury. The video created by Fred & Farid[40] showed Williams in an attempt to get noticed by a group of women, first stripping and then tearing chunks of skin and muscle from his body, and caused controversy in the United Kingdom and many other countries. The video was edited by Top of the Pops for its graphic content and many other channels followed suit.[41] The song became an instant hit, reaching number one in the UK (becoming his third number one single as a solo artist) and New Zealand. The song went on to win \"Best Song of 2000\" at the MTV Europe Music Awards, \"Best Single of the Year\" at the Brit Awards and an MTV Video Music Award for Best Special Effects.[42] When the album, Sing When You're Winning was released in August 2000, it topped the charts in many different countries.[43] In the UK the album was certified 2× Platinum on its first week of release.[44] After the success of his third album, Williams wanted to take another musical direction. He took two weeks off from his tour to record Swing When You're Winning, his fourth studio album. Born from his lifelong love for Frank Sinatra – combined with the success of the track \"Have You Met Miss Jones?\" that he recorded for the film Bridget Jones' Diary in 2001 – the album was recorded at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles. Williams took the chance to duet with his long-time friend Jonathan Wilkes, Little Voice star Jane Horrocks, Saturday Night Live star Jon Lovitz, Rupert Everett and actress Nicole Kidman. The first single released from the album was a duet with Kidman, on \"Somethin' Stupid\". Originally a hit for Frank and Nancy Sinatra, the song became Williams' fifth number one hit in the UK.[45] It eventually went on to become one of the biggest hits of 2001.[46] \"Beyond the Sea\" was featured over the credits of the film Finding Nemo in 2003 and was also released on the film's soundtrack CD. A DVD, Robbie Williams Live at the Albert Hall, was released in December of that year. So far, it has become one of the best selling music DVDs in Europe, being certified 6× Platinum in the United Kingdom[47] and 2× Platinum in Germany.[48] In 2002, Williams signed a record-breaking £80 million contract with EMI.[49] The contract included a number of provisos, including the label ceding greater creative control to the artist and a commitment to breaking Williams into the US market. It remains the biggest music deal in British history. The deal was brokered by Ingenious Media, a UK corporate finance advisory business. Williams began working on what would be his fifth studio album, spending a year in the recording studio. The album heralded a new era for Williams. He had taken a more active role in the making of this album. \"One Fine Day\", \"Nan's Song\", and \"Come Undone\" were the first songs that Williams wrote without the input of Guy Chambers. Most of the songs were recorded in Los Angeles. \"For the first time in my life, I'm speechless.\" The album's first single, \"Feel\", written by Williams and Chambers, was recorded as a demo. When they started working on the album and were trying to re-record the vocals, Williams felt dissatisfied with it, so he decided to include the demo version and then release it as the first single. When the single was released in late 2002, it became Williams' biggest international hit, going number one in The Netherlands and Italy and reaching the top ten in many European countries.[50] When Williams' fifth studio album, Escapology, was released in late 2002, it hit number one in at least 10 countries around the world. In the United States, it failed to make such an impact. Escapology sold almost 2 million copies by the end of 2003 in the United Kingdom.[51] On 1–3 August 2003, Williams played three consecutive concerts at Knebworth to 125,000 people each night, making it the biggest event in UK music history.[6] Memorable performances included \"Come Undone\" where he interjected with \"Britain, I'm Your Son\", and further interacted with the audience when he brought a girl up on stage.[52] In October 2003, Williams released a live album of the concerts, Live at Knebworth.[53] In October 2004, Williams released Greatest Hits, a retrospective of his career, which also contained new tracks he had been working on with then-new collaborator Stephen Duffy. \"Radio\", the compilation's first single, debuted at number one in the UK Singles Chart,[36] becoming Williams' sixth number-one hit. When the compilation was released, it debuted at number one in the UK[36] and was the best selling album of the year in the UK[54] and Europe.[55] Eight years after the release of \"Angels\", the British public voted it as the \"Best Single of the Past Twenty-Five Years\" at the 2005 Brit Awards.[56] After touring Latin America in late 2004 for the promotion Greatest Hits, Williams started working on his sixth studio album. Recorded at his house in the Hollywood Hills, the album was co-written by Stephen Duffy over the course of 24 months. The album Intensive Care was launched in Berlin on 9 October. It became an international hit. In November 2005, Williams took home the MTV Europe Music Award for 'Best Male', but also, entered in The Guinness Book of World Records when he announced his World Tour for 2006, selling 1.6 million tickets in one single day.[57] Williams kicked off his Close Encounters World Tour in South Africa in April 2006; when he finished his European leg of the tour, 2.5 million people had seen the show and, after touring Latin America and Australia, the numbers went up to 3 million.[58] Williams released his much anticipated dance/electro album, Rudebox, on 23 October 2006. It featured collaborations with the Pet Shop Boys, William Orbit, Soul Mekanik, Joey Negro, Mark Ronson, Chris Grierson, and The Orr Boys. It received mixed reviews: Allmusic gave it a four star rating, the NME 8 out of 10, and Music Week and MOJO were equally positive,[59] but it received much weaker reviews from some of the British press. The album sold 2× Platinum in Europe with sales of over 2 million making it the fastest platinum-selling album of 2006.[60] To promote his album, Williams commissioned a series of short films.[61] Goodbye to the Normals was directed by Jim Field Smith and features \"Burslem Normals\" by Williams. In February 2009, it was confirmed that Williams had written material with Guy Chambers and Mark Ronson. A spokesman said that Williams was planning to begin the recording sessions in March and that the new album would be released in late 2009. This will probably be the last Williams album released by EMI.[62] On his official website, Williams confirmed that he was working with producer Trevor Horn on his new album, which would eventually be titled Reality Killed the Video Star,[63] a reference to the song \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" by Horn's former band the Buggles. The album was released on 9 November 2009 in the United Kingdom.[64] On 11 October 2009 Williams published a 12-track compilation album, titled Songbook, as a free CD for the newspaper The Mail on Sunday. That same evening, Williams made his \"comeback\" on The X Factor results show, performing his new single \"Bodies\" for the first time live.[65] On 20 October 2009 Williams opened the BBC Electric Proms at the London RoundHouse.[66] It was his first live concert for 3 years and was broadcast across 200 cinemas worldwide.[67] Accompanied by a string section, horn section, full band and producer Trevor Horn, Williams performed several new tracks from Reality Killed the Video Star and older tracks.[67] Reality Killed the Video Star was previewed in the UK on the Spotify music streaming service on 6 November 2009, and official released on 9 November.[68] In a high-profile chart battle, Williams' album was pitted against X Factor 2008 runners-up JLS who released their debut album the same day. JLS beat Williams to the number one spot by 1500 sales. The album was also released in the United States (Williams' first album to be released there since 2002's Escapology). In late November 2009, Williams travelled to Australia to perform at the ARIA Music Awards of 2009.[69] In October 2010, Williams released his second greatest hits album, In and Out of Consciousness: The Greatest Hits 1990–2010, to celebrate 20 years as a performing artist. A single, \"Shame\", was also released, which was written and sung by Williams and Barlow. On 21 October 2011 Williams signed with Island Records (Universal Music), following his departure from his previous record label EMI in 2010.[70] Williams was the opening act at the Diamond Jubilee Concert, which was co-organised by Gary Barlow, held outside Buckingham Palace on 4 June 2012.[71] During the end of August his official website began a countdown to the release of information regarding his latest solo material, with an image of his face and his mind unveiled daily as the countdown expired.[72] Titled Take the Crown, the album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart making it Williams' tenth number one album. It also marked the second time that Williams had a number one single (\"Candy\") and album at the same time on the chart. The first time was in 2001 when \"Somethin' Stupid\" and Swing When You're Winning were number one on the singles and albums chart respectively.[73] The album's lead single, \"Candy\", premiered on 10 September 2012 and was released on 11 September in most countries and 29 October in the UK. In the UK, \"Candy\" became Williams' first number one single since \"Radio\" (2004) and his seventh solo number one single. In its first week the song had sold 137,000 copies becoming the fastest-selling male artist single of the year.[74] On 26 November 2012 Williams announced a 17 date stadium tour of Europe.[75][76] Williams also confirmed that the support act for the tour would be Olly Murs who also duets with him on \"Kids\". Universal and EMI merged in 2012, bringing Williams' Chrysalis/Virgin recordings full circle to Universal. In September 2013, Williams announced a follow-up to his 2001 swing album, titled Swings Both Ways for release in November. The album features covers and original songs, whilst also including duet recordings with Michael Bublé, Olly Murs, Rufus Wainwright, Lily Allen and Kelly Clarkson.[77] In November 2013, Williams made a cameo appearance in the video to Murs's song \"Hand on Heart\".[78] Williams released a compilation album entitled Under the Radar Volume 1 on 1 December 2014 through his website, featuring leftovers and unreleased songs.[79] \"[These are] loads and loads of songs that I have written that I am incredibly passionate about, I want you to hear them, otherwise they are just going to remain in my computer!\"[80] Williams said that Guy Chambers was \"not happy\" about these songs being released online: \"He thinks I am a lunatic for not putting them on an album that we have promoted with TV performances and at radio stations and a big tour,\" Williams said. \"But I am an impetuous bugger, and I want them out now, now, now!\"[81] In May 2016, it was announced that Williams had signed a recording contract with Sony Music. In a statement, Williams said: \"They're [Sony Music] inspired, I'm inspired. I'm more ready than I ever have been and I'm totally convinced I'm in the right place. I look forward to working on this album, which is an album I'm immensely proud of, in this exciting new partnership with Sony Music.\"[82] The Heavy Entertainment Show became his 12th UK number-one album, putting him level with Madonna.[83] In July 2017, Williams announced a new album, Under the Radar Volume 2, which was released in November 2017.[84] A third edition in the Under the Radar series was released on Valentine's Day of 2019.[85] On 14 June 2018, Williams performed at the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony held at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia.[86] Williams sang \"Let Me Entertain You\" and \"Feel\" before he performed a duet of \"Angels\" with Russian soprano Aida Garifullina.[86][87] Williams then performed an encore with \"Rock DJ\", during which he gave the finger.[88] Fox in the U.S. apologised for the incident which they had broadcast live.[88] The incident was not shown on ITV in the UK who had cut away prior to the encore.[88] Williams appeared on This Morning on 19 June and explained what happened, \"It was one minute to kick off, I was under a lot of pressure, because there was one minute left and I didn't know how I was going to do half a minute, so I just did a one-minute countdown [using his middle finger].\" Asked by presenter Phillip Schofield whether he regrets it, he said: \"Yeah, of course, yeah. I cannot trust me. I don't know what I'm going to do at any time. There's no, sort of, plan. The plan was, sing in key, don't fall over. That was the plan and 99% of the plan, I pulled off.\" When asked did the idea just enter his head he responded, \"Nothing actually pops into my head. There's a block between me and sense... then something happens and then five minutes later, I'm like, 'Did I? Yeah, I did, didn't I?\".[89] On 17 July 2018, Williams along with his wife, and One Direction star Louis Tomlinson, were announced as the new judges on the fifteenth series of The X Factor in the UK, joining Simon Cowell and replacing Louis Walsh, Sharon Osbourne and Nicole Scherzinger.[90] On 22 November, Williams released his first Christmas album titled The Christmas Present, which features guest appearances from boxer Tyson Fury, Rod Stewart, Jamie Cullum, Helene Fischer and Bryan Adams.

Williams said he was working on more experimental music, which he likened to David Bowie and Lou Reed, but said: \"Do I unashamedly want to still be one of the biggest artists in the world? Yeah, I do ... I've had an interesting first half of my life. I'd like an interesting second half, too.\"[94] In May 2022, Williams performed at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, Australia, during the filming of his Better Man biopic which was produced at Docklands Studios Melbourne, and was expected to be released in late 2023 however its schedule was delayed instead to 2024.[95] On 7 June 2022, Williams announced that his tenth compilation album, XXV, would be released on 9 September 2022.[96] It will feature new, reimagined versions of his hit songs, plus new material.

His appearance attracted criticism due to Qatar's human rights abuses and strict LGBT laws.[111][112][113] After the criticism, Williams stated, \"I don't condone any abuses of human rights anywhere [...] if we're not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, then it would be the shortest tour the world has ever known: I wouldn't even be able to perform in my own kitchen [...] Anybody leaving messages saying 'no to Qatar' are doing so on Chinese technology [...] the hypocrisy there is that if we take that case in this place, we need to apply that unilaterally to the world. Then if we apply that unilaterally to the world, nobody can go anywhere.\"[114] On 5 May 2023, Williams was featured on the bilingual single \"Une Tahitienne á Paris\", by French singer Mareva Galanter.[115][116] On 21 August 2023, Williams was featured with a cameo performance on the single \"Punk's Dead\", by English duo Soft Play.[117] Lufthaus' debut album, \"Visions, Volume 1\" was released on 6 October 2023.

Williams launched a radio show titled Radio Rudebox on 6 October 2011 where he played music and interviewed Gary Barlow. In 2011, Williams announced he was working with entrepreneur Peter Jones in developing a clothing line called Farrell in honour of his grandfather Jack Farrell.[137] Although the business had filed for bankruptcy, it was later relaunched in 2014 with support of clothing company Primark.[138] Williams recorded the song \"It's Only Us\" as the theme for the FIFA video game FIFA 2000.[139] As part of the agreement to license the track EA Sports included Port Vale, the football club Williams supports, in the game, despite only being in the third tier of the English football league system.[139] Williams features in his own karaoke video game, We Sing Robbie Williams, which was released on 12 November 2010 by Nordic Games Publishing AB.[140] In 2005, Williams founded a football team called Los Angeles Vale F.C. Williams formed the club with other celebrity friends after building his own soccer pitch at his home in Los Angeles.[141][142] The club was named after Williams' hometown club, Port Vale, and its logo was very similar.[143] The club supposedly was disbanded in 2007, reportedly after Williams discovered two players had swindled him out of £200,000.[144][145] In January 2024, Williams was named president of Port Vale Football Club in Stoke-on-Trent.[146] In 2018, it was announced that Williams and Guy Chambers would write the music and lyrics (with a book by Mark Ravenhill) for the stage musical adaptation of David Walliams' children's book The Boy in the Dress for the Royal Shakespeare Company.

At the age of 10, he got into hip hop and started collecting electro albums;[152] and when he started his solo career in the '90s, he was influenced by Britpop bands such as Oasis, Blur and Pulp.[153] As a singer, his influences include George Michael, Tom Jones,[152] Elvis Presley and Bono.[154] He worked with Jones several times throughout his career: They performed together at the Brit Awards in 1998; the following year, they recorded a cover of the song \"Are You Gonna Go My Way\" for Jones' album Reload; and in 2012, Williams and Jones worked together again on the song \"On My Own\", b-side of his single \"Different\". Williams also feels great admiration for Freddie Mercury[155] and Queen. In 2001, Williams, Brian May and Roger Taylor released a new version of \"We Are the Champions\" for the movie A Knight's Tale. He also revealed that he was once asked to be the new frontman of Queen, but that he turned down the offer because of his \"very low self-esteem\". He said: \"I just thought I'd save them the audacity of me even trying to step on a stage and be in the same echelon as Freddie Mercury. Because he, to me, is angelic. He's godlike. It was just too scary.\"[156] Williams has revealed that he does the \"Elvis Prayer\" before going on stage at every concert. In 2000, he got a tattoo of the phrase \"Elvis Grant Me Serenity\"[157] and he also played as an Elvis impersonator in the music video for his song \"Advertising Space\" (2005). Speaking to BBC Radio 2 in February 2021, Williams cited Ian Dury as his biggest inspiration as a lyricist.[158] He sings on \"You're the Why\", the final track of the posthumously released album Ten More Turnips from the Tip (2002).[159] By 2008, Williams had sold more albums in the UK than any other British solo artist in history.[160] His record sales stand at over 77 million worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time.[161] Williams was entered in The Guinness Book of World Records when, after he announced his World Tour for 2006, 1.6 million tickets were sold in one day.[162] \"It's his self-deprecating sense of humour — in person and in his lyrics — that helps explain his wide appeal in Australia. Perhaps only Pink and Ed Sheeran have such a wide mix of demographics at their concerts; that's why Williams will play to nearly 60,000 people in Victoria alone.\" Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote that Williams is \"a perfect meeting of ego, self-deprecation and hits\", adding \"there really is nobody else, in pop music anyway, who combines monumental hamminess and bone-deep vulnerability quite so effectively.\"[164] Williams has won significantly more Brit Awards than any other artist, a record eighteen—Best British Male Artist four times, two awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music and the 2017 Brits Icon for his \"lasting impact on British culture\", and eight German ECHO awards.[4][165][166] In 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame, after being voted as the Greatest artist of the 1990s.[167] He appeared in the 2009 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records when his sell-out show at the BBC Electric Proms at London's Roundhouse was screened by more than 250 cinemas across 23 countries to set a new record for the most simultaneous cinematic screenings of a live concert.[168] Williams appears in the list of the all-time Top 100 biggest selling albums in the UK six times–with four albums in the top 60.[54] In 2005, the British public voted \"Angels\" the song they would most like played at their funeral.[169] In October 2009, it was announced that he would receive the Outstanding Contribution to British Music award at the 2010 Brit Awards.[170] In September 2010, Williams switched on the Blackpool illuminations, stating that it was one of the greatest honours he had achieved.[171] In October, Media Control named Williams the most successful album-artist of the millennium due to the fact that he had spent No. 1 on the German Albums Chart for 38 weeks since 2000. He also reached that chart's Top Ten 135 times.[172] He was ranked at No. 11 the greatest frontman of all time in a reader poll by Q magazine.[173] Contemporary artists have expressed their admiration for Williams and cited him as one of their influences. The English rapper Example admitted his obsession with Williams and how he had been inspired by Williams' performances when he was younger. He described his own performance on stage as \"a combination of rap, rock and Robbie Williams\".[174][deprecated source?] Ed Sheeran, in an interview with El Hormiguero, revealed the first album he ever bought was Life Thru a Lens.[175] Olly Murs paid tribute to Williams' \"Angels\" music video in the music video for his single \"Hand on Heart\".

It felt like a public airing of very private pain.\" Williams has reportedly battled mental illness, obesity, self-esteem issues, alcoholism, and substance abuse throughout his life.[183][184] He has discussed how his friend Elton John booked him into a clinic to cope with his drug use that emerged from the depression he was experiencing while still in Take That.[184] Williams revealed in 2011 he had been experiencing lethargy caused by a type of hormone imbalance called andropause for a number of years, and thought at first it was a return of his depression.[185][186] In a June 2020 interview with Weight Watchers Magazine, he revealed that he had developed an addiction to online golf games.[187] Williams also has dyslexia and dyscalculia.[188] Williams has a keen interest in UFOs and related paranormal phenomena, and researched the subject during his 2007–2008 sabbatical.[189] He participated in a documentary for BBC Radio 4 with Jon Ronson about the paranormal. The documentary followed them to a UFO convention in Nevada, during which Williams linked his obsession in the paranormal with the desire to understand his childhood fears of his mother's belief in \"the world's mysteries, elves, demons, [and] witchcraft\".[190] Williams featured in a 2018 TV documentary Hunt for the Skinwalker by Jeremy Corbell, and revealed that his partner Ayda Field dissuaded him from buying the Skinwalker Ranch when it became for sale.[191][192][193] Williams became an ordained minister with the Universal Ministries to officiate the wedding of friends.[194] Williams has a number of tattoos, many of which are related to British culture.

She was featured in the UFO documentary that Williams did for BBC Radio 4[207] and took part in a field investigation he did in Trout Lake, Washington, in 2008.[208] Williams and Field wed at his home in Mulholland Estates in Beverly Hills on 7 August 2010.[209][210][211] They have four children: daughters Theodora and Colette,[212] and sons Charlton and Beau.[213] Williams's wife is Ashkenazi Jewish.[214] Williams considers his children to be Jewish.[215] There have been questions about Williams's sexuality, with some speculating that he may be bisexual.[216][217] In an interview with the Daily Star, he stated: \"I love musical theatre and a lot of the other things that are often associated with gays. I am 49% homosexual and sometimes as far as 50%. However, that would imply that I enjoy having a particular sort of fun, which I don't.\"[218] In the 2011 Sunday Times Rich List of wealthiest people in the British music industry, his wealth was estimated at £90 million. Williams is a lifelong supporter of football club Port Vale, based in his home town of Stoke-on-Trent, and in February 2006 he bought £240,000 worth of shares in the club, making him the largest shareholder.[219] However, the club entered administration on 9 March 2012, and as a result Williams lost all of his shares in the club and received only a fraction of his original investment back.[220] Williams has set up a charity in his home town of Stoke-on-Trent entitled Give It Sum, its goal being to \"improve local conditions and strengthen community life by giving money to those who are disadvantaged.\"[183][221] Williams, with the help of friend Jonathan Wilkes, has organised charity football matches called Soccer Aid to raise money for UNICEF UK. A mixture of non-football celebrities and professional football players have played Soccer Aid matches in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 at Old Trafford, and Etihad Stadium in Manchester and Wembley Stadium, Stamford Bridge, and the London Stadium in London.[222] Williams has been the Patron of the children's charity the Donna Louise Trust, based in Stoke-on-Trent, since 2002.

                "content": "Robert Peter \"Robbie\" Williams[1] (born 13 February 1974) is an English singer and occasional actor. In the United Kingdom, he has sold more albums than any other British singer. He has sold more than 70 million records worldwide.[2] Williams performed his first songs in 1990 with the group Take That. In 1995, he left Take That to start playing and writing music on his own. On 15 July 2010, he rejoined Take That.[3][4] The group released a new album in November 2010. It became the second fastest-selling album of all time in UK chart history[5] and the fastest-selling record of the century.[6] After he left Take That, Williams' first record was the song \"Freedom,\" which was written by George Michael. His first album was called \"Life Thru a Lens\". It was first sold in September 1997. At this time, Williams had many problems with alcohol and depression. \"Angels,\" a song from his first album, became his most famous song. Because \"Angels\" was so successful,[7] the album \"Life Thru a Lens\" became much more popular, and he sold more than three million copies of it in Europe. Williams wrote \"Millennium,\" which was a song based on the music from the James Bond films, for his second album, \"I've Been Expecting You\". \"Millennium\" became his first Number one in the charts. Two more songs from the same album, \"No Regrets\" (which Williams wrote with Neil Tennant and Neil Hannon) and \"Strong\", were both successful in the United Kingdom. Another song from this album, \"She's The one\", also became a number One song. Williams was not very successful outside Europe until he made the album \"Sing When You're Winning\", which was first sold in August 2000. The song \"Rock DJ\" won many awards: for example, it was called \"Best Single (song) Of The Year\" at the BRIT Awards, and MTV gave Robbie Williams an award for the special effects in the video. At this time, Robbie Williams recorded a duet, \"Kids\", with Kylie Minogue. Many of his songs, for example, \"Supreme\" and \"Better Man\", became popular in many different countries. In 2001, Williams recorded covers (copies) of several songs that had been performed earlier by Frank Sinatra. One of these songs was a duet with Nicole Kidman, called \"Somethin' Stupid\". Later in 2001, he began to sell the album \"Swing When You're Winning\". The album became successful very quickly. Altogether he sold 7 million copies. A song from the album, \"Beyond the Sea\", was used at the end of the film \"Finding Nemo\". At this time, he also recorded a song he had written, \"Eternity\", which was not on any albums. It was very successful and became a Number one song. In 2002, Williams signed a contract to say he would work for the company EMI.[8] He worked on his next album, \"Escapology\", for a year. Many people think that \"Escapology\" was different from Williams' earlier music. The album was very successful in Europe, but it was not so successful in America. For the video for the song \"Something Beautiful\", Robbie ran a competition. The winner of the competition pretended to be Williams in the video. In the end, he chose three winners, so he made three different videos for the song. In 2004, Williams put his most popular songs together. He called this collection \"Greatest Hits\". There were also some new songs on this album, for example, \"Radio\". In February 2005, the BRIT Awards TV show asked people to vote to answer the question \"What was the best song between 1980 and 2005?\" The winner was \"Angels\" by Williams.[9] In October 2005, Williams' sixth album, \"Intensive Care\", was first sold. Williams and Steven Duffy wrote the songs for this album. At this time, four of the singers from Take That went to London for a TV show. They asked Williams to come, but he said he did not want to come to London with them. The newspaper The Sunday Mirror said that the other singers were \"gutted\" (very unhappy and disappointed) because Williams would not come. In 2006, Williams started to perform at concerts all over the world. He recorded his new song, \"Rudebox\", which was very different from his other songs. Many people did not like it, and the newspaper The Sun said that \"Rudebox\" was \"the worst song ever\".[10] The song was quite successful, but the album, which was also called \"Rudebox\", sold fewer copies than any of Williams' other albums.[11] Williams worked with Guy Chambers and Mark Ronson for his next album, Reality Killed the Video Star.[12] The album was released on 9 November 2009 in the United Kingdom.[13] On 11 October 2009 Williams published a 12-track compilation album, titled Songbook. It was a free CD for the newspaper The Mail on Sunday. The CD is a one-off album of some of his biggest hits - including several rare live performances.[14] In October 2010 Williams released his second greatest hits album, In and Out of Consciousness: The Greatest Hits 1990–2010, to celebrate 20 years as a performing artist.[15] In June 2011 Robbie Williams said he was working with Gary Barlow on a new solo album.[16] He was the opening act at the Diamond Jubilee concert held outside Buckingham Palace on 4 June 2012. Williams' ninth album Take the Crown was released on 5 November 2012. On 15 November 2013 Williams' tenth album Swings Both Ways was released. Williams lives in Los Angeles, in California.[17] He has often said that he likes Los Angeles because he can feel free and private. Williams moved back to the UK in 2009. He bought an £8.5 million mansion in Compton Bassett, Wiltshire. It was nearby to close friend Jonathan Wilkes who lives in Swindon. Williams sold the mansion a year later to move back to Los Angeles. He often has problems with alcohol, drugs and mental illness.[18][19] He has often visited special hospitals to cure his addiction to alcohol and drugs. Some people have suggested that Williams might be gay, but he says he has \"never slept with (had sexual intercourse with) a man\". In 2005, when MGN wrote an article that said Williams was gay, his lawyer made the writers give him compensation (money) because they had written libel (lies).[20] He has had relationships with many women, including TV presenter Rachel Hunter and singer Nicole Appleton. On 7 August 2010, Williams and long time girlfriend, actress Ayda Field, married at his home in Los Angeles.[21] On 30 March 2012 Williams said that he and his wife would become parents for the first time.[22] Their daughter Theodora Rose was born on 18 September 2012.[23] Studio albums as a solo artist See also Studio albums with Take That Studio albums with Lufthaus",

                "content": "The Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball program is the men's college basketball team of the University of Kentucky. It has eight NCAA championships, the best all-time winning percentage, and the most all-time victories.[2] The Wildcats compete in the Southeastern Conference and are coached by Mark Pope.[3] Adolph Rupp first brought Kentucky to national prominence, winning four NCAA titles. Since then, Joe B. Hall, Rick Pitino, Tubby Smith, and John Calipari each won a national championship, making Kentucky the only school with five coaches to win NCAA championships and placing it second only to UCLA for most titles. Kentucky has finished as the NCAA runner-up four times, making it tied with UCLA and North Carolina for all-time title game appearances at 12. The program has played in 17 NCAA Final Fours, tying Duke for third-all time behind North Carolina and UCLA. Kentucky leads all schools in several NCAA tournament stats: Elite Eight appearances at 38, Sweet Sixteen appearances at 45, total NCAA tournament appearances at 60, and tournament games played at 184. The program is behind only North Carolina with 131 NCAA tournament wins, North Carolina has 132. Kentucky has also won the National Invitation Tournament twice, making it the only school to win multiple NCAA and NIT championships, and it leads all schools in total postseason appearances at 68. Additionally, the Helms Athletic Foundation declared Kentucky the 1933 and 1954 national champions, the latter being Kentucky's only undefeated team in the modern era (post-1930). The 1948 NCAA champion team, coached by Rupp, represented the United States in the Olympics and won a gold medal. Kentucky was the first program to 1000 wins in 1968 and the first to 2000 wins in 2009. The program leads all schools with sixty-three 20-win seasons, sixteen 30-win seasons, and six 35-win seasons. Additionally, Kentucky is second among all teams in conference regular season championships with 53. Throughout its history, the Kentucky basketball program has featured many notable and successful players, both on the collegiate level and the professional level. Five players have been named national player of the year, with Anthony Davis in 2012 and Oscar Tshiebwe in 2022 being consensus selections. Three players have been named national freshman of the year: John Wall in 2010, Davis in 2012, and Reed Sheppard in 2024. Thirty-nine players have been selected as All-Americans a total of 51 times. Kentucky holds the record for the most overall NBA Draft selections (128) and three Wildcats have been selected as the first overall pick (Wall, Davis, and Karl-Anthony Towns). Thirty-nine players have been honored with jersey retirements, as well as Rupp, Hall, Pitino, Smith, equipment manager Bill Keightly, and broadcaster Cawood Ledford. Seven players have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, as well as Rupp, Pitino, Calipari, Eddie Sutton, and Ledford. During Kentucky's earliest seasons the program went through multiple coaches, with the majority staying only one or two seasons. Records indicate that the first head coach of the Wildcats was W. W. H. Mustaine, who in 1903 called together some students, took up a collection totaling $3 for a ball, and told the students to start playing.[4] The first recorded intercollegiate game at the college was a 15–6 defeat to nearby Georgetown College. The team went 1–2 for their first \"season\", also losing to Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) but defeating the Lexington YMCA.[5] Through 1908, the team did not manage a winning season, and had an all-time record of 15–29. In the fall of that year a full-time head coach was hired, Edwin Sweetland. This made him the first paid coach in Kentucky's basketball history.[6] That year, the team went 5–4, and only three years later, boasted their first undefeated season with nine victories and no losses.[7] The 1914 team under Alpha Brummage, led by brothers Karl and Tom Zerfoss, went 12–2 and defeated all its Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association opponents. In 1919, George Buchheit became the new head coach of the Wildcats. An alumnus of the University of Illinois, he brought with him a new system of basketball. The \"Buchheit system\" or \"Illinois system\", focused on defense and featured one player standing under each basket, while three roamed the court. Bucheit varied the system he learned in Illinois in one important way. While the Illinois system employed a zone defense, Buchheit's system used an aggressive man-to-man scheme. On offense, he used a complicated system of passing called the \"zig-zag\" or \"figure eight\" offense.[8] Although the team had a losing season in Buchheit's first year, they won the first-ever Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament the next year, defeating the heavily favored Georgia Bulldogs. Both of these teams were composed entirely of native Kentuckians, anchored by All-American Basil Hayden. The tournament victory was considered Kentucky's first major success, and the 1921 team became known as the \"Wonder Team.\"[9] In 1922, the team was unable to build on the success of the \"Wonder Team.\" Although every player was eligible in 1922, two key players, Hayden and Sam Ridgeway, were injured before the start of the season. Hayden returned from his knee injury during the season, but was never able to play at the level he had the previous year. Ridgeway fought a year-long battle with diphtheria, and although he recovered, never played for the Wildcats again. The remaining three members of the \"Wonder Team\" went 9–5 for the season, and bowed out of the SIAA tournament in the second round.[10] Buchheit remained as coach through the 1924 season before moving on to coach Trinity College (later Duke University). A different coach would guide the team for each of the next four years. C.O. Applegran immediately followed Buchheit, and his 1925 team posted a respectable 13–8 record. Applegran in college had played for the University of Illinois, where he became an All-American. The next year, Ray Eklund led the team to a 15–3 record, and produced UK's second All-American, Burgess Carey.[11] The record was enough for Kentucky to win their first regular season conference championship in the Southern Conference. Seeing the cupboard largely bare for the upcoming year, Eklund resigned shortly before the start of the 1927 season. The team scrambled to find a new coach, and former player Basil Hayden left his coaching job at Kentucky Wesleyan College to answer the call. An inexperienced coach and a roster largely depleted of talent left the Wildcats with a 3–13 record that year. The disappointment convinced Hayden that he wasn't the \"coaching type\", and he resigned after the season. Fortunately for the Wildcats, 1927 would be their last losing season for six decades.[12] The Wildcats' new coach for the 1927–28 season was John Mauer. Although he had a talented group of players moving up from the junior varsity team, Mauer quickly discovered that his players did not know the fundamentals of the game. He began a regimen of three-hour practices five days a week during the preseason. The practice began with half an hour of shooting drills and usually ended with a full-court scrimmage. Between the two, Mauer worked on skill drills and scenarios. Mauer's teams were nicknamed the \"Mauermen.\"[13] Teamwork was the hallmark of Mauer's system. Every player worked on every aspect of the game; there were no specialists. Like Buchheit, Mauer employed a strong man-to-man defense. He utilized a slow-break offense that relied on a complicated system of short passes to get a good shot. Two elements of Mauer's system were new to basketball in the south – the offensive screen and the bounce pass. The latter was so new to most of UK's opponents that it was referred to as the \"submarine attack.\"[14] Over his three-year tenure, Mauer led the Wildcats to an overall record of 40–14. One major prize eluded him, however. Despite having teams that were almost universally acknowledged as the \"class of the South\", Mauer never led a team to the Southern Conference title. Despite his innate ability for coaching, Mauer lacked the ability to heighten his team's emotions for a big game, a fault that was cited as the reason for his lack of tournament success. Mauer left the Wildcats to coach the Miami University Redskins following the 1930 season.[15] In 1930, the university hired Adolph Rupp, who had played as a reserve for the University of Kansas 1922 and 1923 Helms National Championship teams,[16] under coach Forest C. \"Phog\" Allen. At the time of his hiring, Rupp was a high school coach in Freeport, Illinois.[4] Rupp coached the University of Kentucky men's basketball team from 1930 to 1972. There, he gained the nicknames, \"Baron of the Bluegrass\", and \"The Man in the Brown Suit\". Rupp, who was an early innovator of the fast break and set offense, gained a reputation as an intense competitor, a strict motivator, and strategist. Rupp's Wildcat teams won 4 NCAA championships (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958), one NIT title in 1946, appeared in 20 NCAA tournaments, had 6 NCAA Final Four appearances, captured 27 Southeastern Conference (SEC) regular season titles, and won 13 SEC tournaments. Rupp's Kentucky teams also finished ranked No. 1 on 6 occasions in the final Associated Press college basketball poll and 4 times in the United Press International (Coaches) poll. In addition, Rupp's 1966 Kentucky squad (nicknamed \"Rupp's Runts\", as no starting player on the squad was taller than 6'5\") finished runner-up in the NCAA tournament, and his 1947 Wildcats finished runner-up in the NIT. Rupp's 1933 and 1954 Kentucky squads were also awarded the Helms National Championship, and his 1934 and 1947 teams were retroactively recognized as the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[17][18][19][20] Rupp gave the '44 team the nickname \"the Beardless Wonders\" and \"Wildkittens\" because according to Rupp, \"It was like running a Kindergarten\".[citation needed] Of the young players, Kentucky's best player was freshman Chad Anderson who, at the age of 17, was named consensus All-American, making him the youngest player to ever earn the title. The Beardless Wonders won 19 of their 21 games, enough to be invited into the NIT. There they were matched up with a Utah team nicknamed the \"Blitz Kids\".[citation needed] Both teams went into the half tied at 24, but with the help of Brannum Kentucky pulled away to win 46–38. Kentucky lost the next game to home town Saint John's.[citation needed] On the way to its first NCAA title, Kentucky went on to a record of 36–3. Of these three losses, all were either away or at neutral sites, keeping Kentucky undefeated at home throughout the entire season. Kentucky started off the beginning of the season with a 7–0 record heading into their away game at Temple. However, Temple was able to give the Cats their first loss by one point, 60–59. But the Wildcats rolled off an 11-win streak before playing at Notre Dame, where they lost 55–64. They did not lose a game for the rest of the regular season. Kentucky continued through the NCAA tournament to the finals, where they faced the Baylor Bears. Kentucky won its first NCAA title in a decisive 58–42 victory. The season did not end after the NCAA tournament, as Kentucky who would play in the Olympic Trials, where they went 2–1, only losing to the Phillips Oilers once. This was performance enough to represent the United States in the 1948 Olympic Games. Despite only being a college team, the starting 5 of Kentucky defeated all of its competition in London, making Kentucky the only team to win both an NCAA title and an Olympic gold medal.[citation needed] Adolph Rupp soon gave this team the nickname \"The Fabulous Five\", in honor of their accomplishments.[citation needed][21] For the 1949 season Kentucky had high expectations with most of the Fabulous Five returning. Big Blue Nation's expectations were met as the 1949 team won one more game than the previous year including both a SEC regular season and SEC tournament championship, while also getting back to the Final Four that March. In the finals Kentucky faced the Oklahoma A&M Cowboys, a team that had previously seen success in the tournament with back-to-back championships in 1945 and 1946. The Fab Five would succeed again winning 46–36 and Kentucky's only back-to-back NCAA championship. Kentucky was the second program in NCAA history to win back-to-back championships (there have been six other schools since). With a returning star player like Bill Spivey, Kentucky hoped to carry their success into the new decade. The Wildcats lost their first game by 11 to Saint John's at home, but they would pull it together for the Sugar Bowl Tournament, which they won, beating NCAA runner-up Bradley. After losing to Tennessee, Kentucky struggled to chain two wins together, losing every other game. They defeated their next 14 opponents, including getting revenge in SEC tournament championship over Tennessee. Heading into the post-season, No. 3 Kentucky played CCNY in the NIT, missing the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats were no match and were thrashed by the CCNY Beavers, 50–83. Over the season Kentucky defeated four top 10 teams, and were ranked in the top 5 the entire season. Vanderbilt, however, knocked off the top ranked Wildcats in the SEC tournament finals denying them an eighth straight SEC tournament title. Kentucky then defeated fourth ranked Kansas State 68–58 in the NCAA finals, . Adolph Rupp was the head coach at Kentucky during the year of the point-shaving scandal of 1951. In 1945 former Kentucky football player Nick Englisis met Kentucky player Ralph Beard while the two played football at Kentucky. Englisis entered the gambling business when he left the football team in 1946, then approached three Kentucky basketball players Ralph Beard, Alex Groza, and Dale Barnstable with his associates in late 1948 about potentially point shaving (fixing the score of games) during the upcoming season in exchange for money. The three players agreed to point shave and successfully shaved points in several games during the 1948–1949 season until an effort to point shave caused the Wildcats to lose to the Loyola Ramblers in the National Invitation Tournament. Groza, Beard, and Barnstable attempted to win the game under the point spread but kept the score too close, allowing the Ramblers to win the game with an impressive performance at the end of the second half. Kentucky faced Villanova in their first game of the NCAA tournament following the loss to Loyola and the three players attempted to win over the point spread. When Groza, Beard, and Barnstable failed to win over the point spread, it caused Englisis to lose all of his money and ended the point shaving deals between Englisis and these three players.[22] On October 20, 1951, Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, and Dale Barnstable were arrested for taking bribes from gamblers to shave points during several games including the National Invitation Tournament game against the Loyola Ramblers in the 1948–49 season.[23][24] At the conclusion of this scandal, a subsequent NCAA investigation found that Kentucky had committed several rule violations, including giving illegal spending money to players on several occasions, and also allowing some ineligible athletes to compete.[24] As a result, the Southeastern Conference voted to ban Kentucky from competing for a year and the NCAA requested all other basketball-playing members not to schedule Kentucky, with eventually none doing so.[25] As a result of these actions, Kentucky was forced to cancel the entire 1952–53 basketball season. Years later, Walter Byers, the first executive director of the NCAA, unofficially referred to this punishment as the first de facto NCAA death penalty, despite the current rule first coming into effect in 1985, thus the NCAA having no such enforcement power previous to that.[26][27] Echoing Mr. Byers' view, the NCAA's official stance is very much the same, and they now state in hindsight, \"In effect, it was the Association's first death penalty, though its enforcement was binding only through constitutional language that required members to compete against only those schools that were compliant with NCAA rules. Despite fears that it would resist, Kentucky accepts the penalty and, in turn, gives the NCAA credibility to enforce its rules.\" [28] The team posted a perfect 25–0 record in the next year (Rupp's only undefeated season), for which it was awarded the 1954 Helms National Championship. In addition, Kentucky also finished ranked No. 1 in the final Associated Press poll. On the team were three players who had graduated at the conclusion of the previous academic year. When, at the last minute, the NCAA ruled these players ineligible from post-season play, Rupp decided to skip the 1954 NCAA Tournament in protest.[citation needed] The \"Fiddlin' Five\" team earned their name though playing around and mistakes, which Rupp described as fiddling. The Fiddlin' Five still has the most losses out of any Kentucky's championships, with six, three of those were in four games.[citation needed] Unlike the Fab Five or the 1951 teams, the Fiddling Five would yoyo in the rankings with their lowest a No. 13 coming after 56–57 loss to unranked Loyola Chicago. Kentucky improved through the tournament though, and won their fourth title over No. 18 Seattle in the confines of Louisville's Freedom Hall. Rupp's last Final Four team and one of his last chances at a 5th NCAA title occurred in the 1965–66 season, with Kentucky going all the way to the NCAA title game. The 1966 NCAA championship game against Texas Western (now University of Texas-El Paso or UTEP) marked the first occurrence that an all-white starting five (Kentucky) played an all-black starting five (Texas Western) in the NCAA championship game.[citation needed] Texas Western won the game 72–65, on the night of March 19, 1966. Kentucky entered the tournament with only one loss and ranked No. 1, Texas Western also had only one loss and entered the tournament ranked second. Kentucky was a 6.5 point favorite in the game[29] The game was depicted in the film Glory Road.[citation needed] This game, and the result of it, were especially significant as the game came at a time when the civil rights movement was coming into full swing around the country. In 1969, after actively recruiting black players for over six years (his first formal scholarship offer was to Wes Unseld in 1964), despite most of the other SEC teams threatening to boycott if a black player took the court), Rupp finally signed his first black player, Tom Payne, an athletic 7'-1\" center out of Louisville. This ended the aspect of all-white Kentucky teams forever, and marked a new era with many notable black Kentucky basketball legends, including Jack Givens, Sam Bowie, Kenny Walker, Jamal Mashburn, Tayshaun Prince, Rajon Rondo, John Wall, Anthony Davis, and Karl Anthony Towns.[30] The late Rupp years looked promising with Dan Issel's commitment to the Wildcats in 1966. Over the next four years Issel scored an average of 25.7 per game, adding up to 2,137 points in his college career. This made Issel the player with the most points to ever play at Kentucky, a feat that has not been matched to this day. This included his 53 points scored against Mississippi State in 1970, the most by a Kentucky player in a single game until Jodie Meeks made 54 against rival Tennessee on January 13, 2009. Issel did not capture the national championship in his college years, but would go on to make a name for himself in the ABA.[citation needed] After 1966 Rupp saw continued success, but the Final Four eluded him. The Wildcats ended with a 13–13 season and missed the tournament altogether in 1967, then reach the Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen in the next two years. Ranked #1 in the nation with a 26–1 record overall, Kentucky nearly missed a Final Four berth in a 106–100 shootout against Jacksonville. [citation needed] Rupp was forced into retirement in March 1972, after reaching age 70. At the time, this was the mandatory retirement age for all University of Kentucky employees. He was a 5-time National Coach-of-the-Year award winner, a 7-time Conference Coach-of-the-Year award winner, and was elected a member of both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and College Basketball Hall of Fame. Further, since 1972, the Adolph Rupp Trophy, considered one of the nation's premier basketball awards, has been given by Commonwealth Athletic Club to the nation's top men's college basketball player. In addition, the University of Kentucky retired a jersey in his honor in the rafters of Rupp Arena, a 23,500-seat arena named after him, dedicated in 1976.[17][18] Joe B. Hall was the head basketball coach at Kentucky from 1972 to 1985. Although he had been an assistant at Kentucky since 1965, Coach Hall was given a difficult task: to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Adolph Rupp. In the 1978 NCAA tournament, he coached the Wildcats to their fifth NCAA championship. He was named National Coach of the Year in 1978 and SEC Coach of the Year on four occasions. His record at UK was 297–100, and 373–156 over his career. Coach Hall won the title once in 1978, as well as making the final four in 1975 and 1984, and the elite eight in 1972, 1973, 1977, 1983.[citation needed] Coach Hall is one of only three men to both play on an NCAA championship team (1949– Kentucky) and coach an NCAA championship team (1978– Kentucky), and the only one to do so for the same school.[citation needed] The only others to achieve this feat are: After a year of playing in the freshman league and a disappointing sophomore season, Hall's Super Kittens returned with hopes of finally bringing Kentucky its fifth title. They nearly did just that, guiding Kentucky to a runner-up finish to UCLA in the 1975 NCAA tournament but not before avenging their 20-point defeat to an undefeated Indiana team. Despite losing in the championship game, it would give freshman Jack Givens a taste for success that would help propel Kentucky to the title three years later. It had been 20 years without a championship in Lexington, and along with pressure of following a hall of fame coach, Hall would nickname the 1978 season the \"Season Without Celebration.\" The pressure to win was immense on both players and coach to bring home the title, especially with a senior laden team that had gone to the finals as freshmen. Kentucky would hardly lose its composure all season or break under pressure, winning 30 of 32 games and defeating eight ranked teams along the way. By the time Kentucky reached the tournament finals they seemed bound to win the title, though Duke would give Kentucky their all. With the help of senior Jack \"Goose\" Givens' 41 points, Kentucky defeated the Blue Devils 94–88, and finally won their fifth title and first in 20 years. In 1985, Eddie Sutton succeeded Joe B. Hall. He coached the Wildcats for four years, leading them to the Elite Eight of the 1986 NCAA tournament. Two seasons later, Sutton and the 25–5 Wildcats captured their 37th SEC title and were ranked as the 6th college basketball team in the nation by the Associated Press and UPI[31][32] before losing to Villanova in the Tournament. Kentucky entered the 1988–89 season with a gutted roster. Ed Davender, Robert Lock and Winston Bennett had all graduated from school, while All-SEC sophomore Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA draft. Additionally, sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspected of cheating on his college entrance exam and voluntarily agreed to sit out until the investigation was finished. Potential franchise recruit Shawn Kemp transferred out of Kentucky after signing with the school early that year.[33] Unfortunately, Manuel was forced to sit out the entire season as the investigation dragged on, essentially leaving the Wildcats in the hands of inexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and true freshman Chris Mills. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and the Wildcats finished with a losing record of 13–19, the team's first losing full-season record since 1927.[32] To add insult to injury, the NCAA announced at the end of the season that its investigation into the basketball program had found the school guilty of violating numerous NCAA policies.[34] The scandal broke when Emery Worldwide employees claimed to have discovered $1,000 in cash in an envelope Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey sent to Mills' father.[35] Later Emery settled a libel lawsuit filed by Casey for a substantial amount of money. Casey was not in Lexington when the envelope was supposedly mailed and the father of Mills said they received no money. The NCAA rescinded its show cause order immediately after the settlement of the lawsuit, and Casey's career has flourished as an NBA coach.[36] Another player, Eric Manuel, was alleged to have received improper assistance on his college entrance exams and was banned from NCAA competition. Whether Manuel was directly involved has been questioned.[37] Kentucky was already on probation stemming from allegations of an extensive scheme of payments to recruits, and the NCAA seriously considered hitting the Wildcats with the \"death penalty\", which would have shut down the entire basketball program (as opposed to simply being banned from postseason play) for up to two years. However, school president David Roselle forced Sutton and athletic director Cliff Hagan to resign. The Wildcats were slapped with three years' probation, a two-year ban from postseason play, the vacating of their two NCAA tournament wins in the 1988 season, and a ban from live television in 1989–90.[38][39] In 1989, Rick Pitino left the NBA's New York Knicks and became the coach at a Kentucky program reeling from the aforementioned scandal. Kentucky would be banned from the 1990 and 1991 post season, with the 1990 season suffering a 14–14 record. Kentucky would improve in 1991 with a beavy of home-grown upperclassmen such as Sean Woods, John Pelphrey, Richie Farmer, Deron Feldhaus, and Reggie Hanson along with the talented freshman Jamal Mashburn. Despite their record of 22–6, Kentucky was still banned from the post season and would have to wait another year to see the Unforgettables succeed in the tournament. Beginning with the 1992 season, Kentucky was free of post season bans. Though they lost one more game than last season, this team was most memorable for going to the Elite Eight (for the first time since Sutton's 1986 team) with many returning upperclassmen from Kentucky. The team is also known for playing in what could be considered one of the greatest games in NCAA tournament history against Duke. In this game defending champion Duke were looking to return to the Final Four once again, Kentucky for the first time in almost a decade. The game was hard-fought and physical on both sides all game including Laettner's infamous stomp on Aminu Timberlake, which resulted in a technical. The teams took the lead back and forth until the final minute of the game which resulted in a first buzzer beater shot by Kentucky's Sean Woods to take the lead 103–102, and then Laettner's shot to win the game for the Blue Devils in the final seconds 104–103. This team came to be known as the \"Unforgettables\" for helping put Kentucky back on the path to success in the 1990s and because the team was made up of home grown Kentucky kids. Kentucky returned a junior Mashburn, along with Travis Ford and Tony Delk. They were expected to reach the Final Four for the first time since Joe B. Hall's 1984 team. The expectations were right, as Kentucky would head into the post-season with only 2 losses and a No. 5 ranking. After winning the SEC Tournament once again, Kentucky stormed to the NCAA Final Four to meet up with Michigan's \"Fab Five\" a team of young and highly talented recruits that brought Michigan to the championship game the year before. As talented as Kentucky was they would fail to reach the championship game with a 78–81 overtime loss to the Wolverines. But this would be the just a glimpse of a run Kentucky would have later in the decade. Kentucky started the next season ranked #1 but would underachieve, falling short of the Elite Eight for the only time under Pitino. The highlight of the season was the \"Mardi Gras Miracle\", a game where Kentucky trailed LSU 68–37 with 15:34 left, but outscored them 62–27 over the remainder of regulation to win 99–95.[40] Starting in 1996, Kentucky would put together a string of Final Fours with help from 9 future NBA players. The \"Untouchables\" as they were nicknamed, would only lose twice, to Final Four bound UMass Minutemen (coached by future Kentucky coach John Calipari) and Mississippi State. It was with their overwhelming talent and chemistry that would win Kentucky their sixth national title in the 1996 NCAA tournament, Kentucky's first NCAA championship in 18 years. The following year, Pitino's Kentucky team made it back to the national title game, losing to Arizona in overtime in the finals of the 1997 NCAA tournament. Pitino's fast-paced teams at Kentucky were favorites of the school's fans. It was primarily at Kentucky where he implemented his signature style of full-court pressure defense. By the end of the Pitino era, Kentucky went from banned from the post season to going to three of the last five Final Fours and five of the last six Elite Eights. For this the 1997 team was dubbed the \"Unbelievables\" for taking a team that was not expected much of to return the Wildcats back to the championship game for a second time. Pitino left Kentucky in 1997 to coach the NBA's Boston Celtics, he then went on to coach Kentucky's in-state rival, the University of Louisville. Orlando \"Tubby\" Smith was introduced by UK Athletic Director C.M. Newton as the Wildcats' 20th head coach on May 12, 1997, charged with the unenviable task of replacing popular coach Rick Pitino. The Wildcats were at the top of the basketball world at the time, having won a national title in 1996 and, according to many, missing a second straight title in 1997 by the torn ACL of shooting guard Derek Anderson.[41] (Anderson tore his ACL in January against SEC foe Auburn; Kentucky lost the 1997 title game in overtime to the Arizona Wildcats.) The team Smith inherited sported seven players from the Arizona loss, and five from the 1996 championship team. However, since most of the players who had left after the 1996 and 1997 seasons were high NBA draft picks, his team had the lowest pre-season ranking since Kentucky came off probation in 1991.[42] In his first season at UK, he coached the Wildcats to their seventh NCAA championship, including a come-from-behind victory against Duke in the Elite Eight, and another comeback win against Stanford, then Utah in the Finals. His 1998 National Championship is unique in modern times, as being along with 1985 Villanova the 2nd team in over 20 years to win without a First Team All American or future NBA Lottery Pick (see 1998 NCAA tournament). The 1998 team was also unlike Kentucky's past two championship teams, often falling behind in games before roaring back to win rather than dominating their competition. Smith's teams, known primarily for a ball line defense-oriented slower style of play coined \"Tubbyball\", received mixed reviews among Kentucky fans who have historically enjoyed a faster, higher-scoring style of play under previous coaches. Smith was also under pressure from Kentucky fans to recruit better players. After leading Kentucky to one National Championship in 1998, Kentucky would complete a perfect 16–0 regular season conference record in 2003, win five SEC regular season championships (1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005) and five SEC Tournament titles (1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004). Smith led the Wildcats to six Sweet Sixteen appearances (1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005) and four Elite Eight appearances (1998, 1999, 2003, 2005) in his ten seasons. He totaled 100 wins quicker than any other Wildcat coach before him except Hall of Famer Adolph Rupp, reaching the plateau in 130 games (John Calipari subsequently broke this record in 114 games). In 2003, he was named AP College Coach of the Year. In 1998, the reserve guard J.P. Blevins scored 9 points, all on 3-pointers sparking the Wildcats to come back from a 15-point deficit in the first half to upset the number 5 seed, Michigan State 60–58. Averaging only 2.2 points a game all season, Blevins was the unlikely hero for the Wildcats who were 6–4, to give the Spartans who were 8-3 an unlikely upset. Especially since they fell behind 26–11 in the first half.[43] Although Smith compiled an impressive resume during his UK career, he came under considerable pressure from many UK fans, who believed that his failure to achieve even a single Final Four appearance in his last nine seasons was inadequate by UK standards. He was infamously dubbed \"Ten Loss Tubby\" by several disgruntled UK fans. Smith's Final Four drought is the longest of any coach in UK history,[44] although Smith did come just a double-overtime loss short of another Final Four appearance in 2005. On March 22, 2007, Smith resigned his position of UK Head Coach to accept the head coach position at the University of Minnesota.[45] On April 6, 2007, Billy Gillispie was formally announced as the new head coach of the University of Kentucky by UK athletic director Mitch Barnhart. He fielded questions from the media during the press conference held at UK's new practice facility, the Joe Craft Center. He expressed his excitement and joy to be not only considered for the position but to have been given the honor and the opportunity to coach what former UK coach Rick Pitino referred to as the \"Roman Empire\" of college basketball. \"I'm very, very grateful and honored to be here, but we have a lot of work to do.\"[46] Gillispie became only the sixth head coach in the last 76 years at the school.[47] Gillispie's second season again started out rocky in 2008 as the 'Cats fell to Virginia Military Institute in their season opener. The second game of the season saw the Wildcats fall to North Carolina by 19 points. UK rebounded to win 11 of their next 12 games, improving their record to 11–3. On January 4, the Wildcats lost a heart breaker to archrival Louisville 74–71 after a 25 ft. shot by Edgar Sosa with 2.3 seconds remaining in the game. Prior to the shot, UK was down 7 with 38.5 seconds left, and Jodie Meeks was fouled shooting a three, proceeded to make all three free throw shots, Patrick Patterson stole an inbound and passed it to Meeks who laid it in to bring the game to 71–69 with 29.6 left, and then an inbound pass went long and Meeks snatched the pass, drove to the hoop and was fouled, and then made both free throws to tie the game at 71 with 22.9 left. So all in all, UK and Meeks got seven points in about 15 seconds to tie the game.[48] Kentucky disposed of Vanderbilt to win their SEC opener on January 10, 70–60. On January 13, in a road game against Tennessee, Jodie Meeks set a new Kentucky scoring record by dropping 54 points on the Volunteers. This total bested Dan Issel's 39-year-old scoring record by 1 point, and propelled UK to a 90–72 win and 2–0 start in conference play.[49] Kentucky followed up this effort with a 68–45 victory at Georgia, improving to 14–4 on the season. With wins over Auburn and Alabama, Kentucky moved to 5–0 in the SEC. On January 26, UK was ranked in the AP Poll (24th) for the first time since week 1 of the 2007–08 season.[50] UK promptly dropped 3 in a row (to Ole Miss, South Carolina, and Mississippi State) before rebounding at home with a thrilling 68–65 win over Florida. Jodie Meeks scored 23 points in the contest, including the fade-away contested 3-point basket with less than 5 seconds remaining to seal the win for UK. On Valentine's Day Kentucky handily defeated Arkansas at Bud Walton Arena 79–63 behind another strong performance from Meeks. Meeks contributed 45 points and helped UK win despite the absence of Patrick Patterson (sprained ankle). With the win, UK remained tied with South Carolina and Tennessee for 1st in the SEC East at 7–3.[51] Following the win UK completely collapsed, losing 5 of its last 6 games to finish the regular season 19–12 with an 8–8 SEC record. Entering the SEC tournament many felt UK would need to win the championship game to get into the NCAA tournament, but UK was defeated in the second game vs. LSU. With an unimpressive regular season and quick elimination in the SEC tournament, UK did indeed miss the NCAA tournament for the first time in 18 years and instead received an invitation to the NIT tournament where the team was defeated in the quarterfinal round against Notre Dame.[52][53] On March 27, 2009, an 18-minute-long meeting occurred between Billy Gillispie, President Dr. Lee Todd, Jr. and Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart, after which it was announced that Gillispie would not be returning as the head coach the next season. Barnhart stressed the firing was due to more than wins and losses, citing \"philosophical differences\" and \"a clear gap in how the rules and responsibilities overseeing the program are viewed\".[54] On April 1, 2009, John Calipari replaced former head coach Billy Gillispie as the Wildcats head coach. To begin his tenure at the University of Kentucky, John Calipari signed one of the best all time recruiting classes.[55] The class was headlined by four five-star recruits: John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Daniel Orton, and Eric Bledsoe.[56] On December 19, 2009, the Wildcats defeated Austin Peay 90–69 extending their record to 11–0, and John Calipari broke Adolph Rupp's record for the most consecutive wins to start a season for a first-year head coach at Kentucky. Kentucky defeated the Drexel Dragons 88–44 on December 21, 2009, to become the first program in college basketball history to claim their 2000th victory.[57] By January 25, 2010, Coach \"Cal\" had the Kentucky Wildcats ranked No. 1 in both the ESPN/Coaches poll and AP poll with a record of 19–0.[58] Calipari helped raise in excess of $1.5 million to aid the country of Haiti during the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. President Barack Obama called the Wildcats to thank them for their relief efforts and wish them luck in their future endeavors. To finish off the 2009–10 regular season, Kentucky won its 44th SEC regular season championship (with a final 14–2 SEC record), and won its 26th SEC tournament championship, beating Mississippi State in the finals. The Wildcats then received a No. 1 seed (their 10th No. 1 seed in history) in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament, where they eventually lost to West Virginia in the Elite Eight. This also marked Kentucky's record 50th NCAA Tournament appearance. In 2011 the Wildcats got off to a good start in the regular season with a record of 12–2, with their only losses being North Carolina away and UConn in the Maui Invitational Finals. Conference play was a different matter, and Kentucky would struggle in the SEC losing 6 out of their 8 away games, all of one were against unranked opponents. To close out the season with a three-game defeat No. 13 Florida, No. 23 Vanderbilt and Tennessee at home for a 22–8 record. The hot streak would continue and Kentucky would win their 27th SEC Tournament Title. This was enough for No. 4 seed on the East regional where they played Princeton in a very close first-round game that ended in a 59–57 victory for the Cats. Knight, Jones and company would exact their revenge in the second round against West Virginia, who knocked off Kentucky in the 2010 tourney. In the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight they would upset the No. 1 seed Ohio State Buckeyes and No. 2 seed North Carolina Tar Heels on their way to the school's 14th Final Four. They lost in the Final Four to eventual National Champion No. 3 seed UConn 56–55. In the 2011–12 season, Calipari led Kentucky to being 16–0 in SEC regular season play, clinching its 45th SEC regular season championship. The last team to do so in the SEC was the 2002–03 Kentucky Wildcats, and before that, the 1995–96 Kentucky Wildcats. Kentucky's regular season record was 30–1, with its only loss being by one point coming from a 3-pointer buzzer-beater by the Indiana Hoosiers' Christian Watford at Assembly Hall on December 10, 2011. In the SEC Tournament, Kentucky fell to Vanderbilt in the championship game, making its overall record 32–2 going into the NCAA tournament. Kentucky was both selected as the No. 1 seed in the South Region and also the No. 1 seed overall of the entire NCAA Tournament. The Sweet 16 match-up on March 23, 2012, was a rematch against Indiana, in which this time the Wildcats prevailed over the Hoosiers 102–90. On March 25, 2012, Kentucky won the South Regional, setting up a Final Four semifinal with the Louisville Cardinals. Calipari's Wildcats defeated the Cardinals (coached by former Kentucky coach Rick Pitino) by a score of 69–61. This sent Kentucky to the National Championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks, where they defeated Kansas 67–59, winning UK's 8th NCAA championship, along with John Calipari's first NCAA Championship as a head coach. This Kentucky team had a record six players drafted in the 2012 NBA draft, including the first time two teammates have been chosen with the first two picks: Anthony Davis (1st overall), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (2nd), Terrence Jones (18th), Marquis Teague (29th), Doron Lamb (42nd) and Darius Miller (46th). The 2012–13 season's recruiting class ranked either first or second by various recruiting experts led by top center Nerlens Noel, guard Archie Goodwin, forward Alex Poythress, and four-star center Willie Cauley-Stein. Kentucky also brought in transfer guard Julius Mays, a graduate student who had previously played at Wright State University and North Carolina State. Mays was eligible to play immediately, because UK offered a master's degree program that Wright State did not. However, the only returner that saw significant minutes from the championship squad was back-up power forward Kyle Wiltjer, who averaged 11 minutes per game (Ryan Harrow sat out the previous season after transferring from NC State before the 2011–12 season). Although the team saw the rise of Jarrod Polson in the first game of the season against Maryland, they struggled to close out closer games and play with the will to win that Calipari demands. On February 12, Noel tore his ACL in a loss against Florida. UK was 17–7 including that game, and went 4–5 the remainder of the season, losing all 5 games away from Rupp Arena. The fourth of those losses was against Vanderbilt in the first round of the SEC tournament, and UK missed the NCAA tournament altogether, being the overall No. 1 seed of the NIT. UK was upset by Robert Morris in the first round of the NIT, ending their season with a 21–12 record. In the press conference following the loss to Robert Morris, Calipari stated that his 2013–14 team would be a \"tough, hard-nosed, fighting team.\" Noel and Goodwin both entered the NBA draft and were both taken in the first round at 6th and 29th, respectively. Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State to be closer to his father that had suffered from a stroke, and Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga. Kentucky brought in the No. 1 recruiting class, featuring a record six McDonald's All-Americans in Julius Randle, Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, James Young, Dakari Johnson, and Marcus Lee, as well as Kentucky natives Derek Willis and Dominique Hawkins, and walk-on E. J. Floreal (son of Edrick Floréal, head coach of UK's track and field team). Alex Poythress and Willie Cauley-Stein did not declare for the 2013 NBA draft, and decided to return for their sophomore seasons. In 2013–14, Kentucky looked to make up for its struggles in the previous season. Despite making the NIT, there were high expectations for this team. The team, however, would be without some of its top players from the 2012–13 team including Nerlens Noel[59] and starting shooting guard Archie Goodwin,[60] who were first-round draft choices in the 2013 NBA draft. Starting power forward Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga[61] and starting point guard Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State.[62] Returning was former McDonald's All-American Alex Poythress and starting center Willie Cauley-Stein.[60] The poor success of the 2012–13 team did not stop John Calipari from again producing another number one recruiting class. The entering class included a record six McDonald's All-Americans[63] highlighted by Julius Randle and the Harrison Twins from Texas, Aaron and Andrew. Many recruiting analysts and experts proclaimed that the 2013 signing class was the greatest recruiting class since the infamous Fab Five in the 1990s.[64] The team began the season ranked number one in both the AP and Coaches polls.[65][66] The season was full of ups and downs. Early in the season the team experienced close losses to Baylor, Michigan State, and North Carolina. Despite those losses the team was able to defeat in-state rival Louisville. Nothing changed in SEC play for them either. The team ended the regular season losing three of their last four games including once to South Carolina, who finished the season 14–20 overall. The team limped into the SEC tournament unranked, and desperately looking for any answer to their disappointing season. Calipari during his weekly radio call-in show mentioned the team was given a \"tweak\".[67] The \"tweak\" sparked speculation and curiosity among the fans and the media to what it could be. The \"tweak\" was never fully revealed. However, the \"tweak\" caused the team to go on an historic run through both the SEC and NCAA tournaments. UK was the runner-up to number one Florida in the SEC Tournament. During the NCAA tournament UK became the first team in history to eliminate three teams from the previous Final Four (Wichita State, Louisville, Michigan). UK was the National Runner-up after losing to Connecticut in the national championship game. After the 2014 season, Kentucky only lost Julius Randle and James Young to the NBA draft.[68][69] The returning players consisted of a record-tying nine McDonald's All-Americans. Juniors Cauley-Stein and Poythress returned with sophomores Aaron and Andrew Harrison, Johnson, and Lee to join the No. 2 ranked 2015 recruiting class which was highlighted of Gatorade Player of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns for the 2015 season.[70] The team began its season in the Bahamas on a six-game tour against international clubs and teams.[71] While in the Bahamas the team established a \"platoon system\" which featured two groups of five players that would rotate every four minutes within the game.[72] The \"platoon system\" was put on display nationally in a 72–40 victory over No. 5 Kansas in the Champions Classic in November.[73] In December, the team defeated UCLA 83–44. Kentucky led 41–7 at halftime, the lowest UCLA point total for a half in its storied history.[74] The SEC regular season began with two overtime victories over Ole Miss and Texas A&M, the closest games Kentucky would play all season. Kentucky finished the regular season with a perfect 31–0 record, the best start in school history.[75] In the SEC tournament, the team won each game by double digits, including a 78–63 victory over Arkansas in the finals. Cauley-Stein was named the MVP of the Tournament. In the NCAA tournament Kentucky played its first two games at the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville. Prior to the regional semifinal against West Virginia, Mountaineers guard Daxter Miles proclaimed that Kentucky would be 36–1 after the game. The comment fueled the team as they defeated West Virginia 78–39, tying the largest margin of victory in the Sweet 16 in NCAA Tournament history.[76] In the regional final Kentucky narrowly defeated Notre Dame 68–66. The only loss of the season was in the Final Four to Wisconsin, who Kentucky defeated the previous season in the Final Four. The 2014–15 team tied the NCAA record for most wins in a season (38).[77] After the season Cauley-Stein and Towns were named consensus All-Americans among other awards received. The Kentucky Wildcats represented USA Basketball, at Globl Jam 2023, and defeated Canada to win the gold medal. Following a first round upset as a 2 seed in the 2024 NCAA Tournament, John Calipari resigned his position of Head Coach to accept the same role at the University of Arkansas. He was officially announced as the Razorbacks Head Coach on April 10, 2024, marking the end of his storied tenure at Kentucky. On April 12, 2024, Kentucky hired BYU head coach Mark Pope for the same position in Lexington,[78] days after Calipari left for the vacant head coaching post at Arkansas.[79] Pope was a member of the Wildcats' 1995-1996 team that won the NCAA Tournament. The Wildcats have had 23 coaches in their 112-year history. Mark Pope is the current head coach. Six Wildcats coaches have won the National Coach-of-the-Year award: Adolph Rupp in 1950, 1954, 1959, 1966, and 1970, Joe B. Hall in 1978, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990 and 1992, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, and John Calipari in 2012 and 2015. Additionally, seven Wildcats coaches have been named Southeastern Conference Coach-of-the-Year: Adolph Rupp in 1964, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, Joe B. Hall in 1973, 1975, 1978 and 1983, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990, 1991 and 1996, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, Billy Gillispie in 2008, and John Calipari in 2010, 2012, and 2015.[80] The following is a list of Kentucky's 8 National Championships: The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition. The * represents overall number one seed which began with the 2004 Tournament. Kentucky has 42 men's basketball players, coaches, and contributors honored in Rupp Arena with banners representing their numbers hung from the rafters. Due to the number of players honored, the fact that several of them have shared numbers, the numbers are not officially retired. Some of the jersey numbers were before the NCAA rule change before the 1957–58 season that outlawed teams wearing jerseys with a number higher than 5 on it that was not changed until 2023.[81] To have a banner hung, the individual must be elected to the UK Athletics Hall of Fame.[82] The following Kentucky players, coaches, and contributors have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The following Kentucky players and coaches have represented their country in basketball in the Summer Olympic Games: The Kentucky Wildcats presently play their home games in 20,545-seat Rupp Arena. When it opened in 1976, it was the largest arena in the United States built specifically for basketball, and retained that status for much of the following 40-plus years. It was opened in 1976 and is named after legendary Kentucky head coach Adolph Rupp. Located off-campus, in downtown Lexington, the facility's official capacity was 23,500+[89] until a renovation project in the 2019 offseason reduced the capacity to 20,545.[90] The Wildcats have consistently led the country in home attendance since the 1976–77 season (when Rupp Arena first opened), winning the National Attendance Title a record 25 times, including 17 of the past 20 seasons, and 8 of the last 10 seasons. Kentucky also has an impressive 529–64 (.892) all-time record in Rupp Arena.[91] In 2007, the university unveiled the Joe Craft Center, a state-of-the-art basketball practice facility and athletics office building attached to the north side of Memorial Coliseum on the \"Avenue of Champions\" at the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington, Kentucky.[91] The 102,000 ft2 structure contains separate practice courts for the men's and women's basketball programs, separate men's and women's locker rooms, state-of-the-art video rooms for game film viewing, new coaches offices, a ticket office, and athletic administration offices.[92] As a result, Memorial Coliseum has more ample space for volleyball and gymnastics practice and games. The facility is named after businessman and philanthropist Joe Craft, a Hazard, Kentucky native, who pledged $6 million towards the completion of the $30 million project.[92][93] Coming off back-to-back national championships, the team moved to Memorial Coliseum in 1950. Nicknamed \"The House That Rupp Built\", the multipurpose facility cost $4 million and seated 12,000 people. It also housed a swimming pool, physical education equipment, and offices for the athletics staff. The team occupied Memorial Coliseum for twenty-six seasons, and sold out all 345 home games they played there during that period. Kentucky also played a 2009 NIT game at Memorial Coliseum due to Rupp Arena being booked. The Wildcats are 307–38 (.890) all-time at Memorial Coliseum.[89][91][94] Today, Memorial Coliseum is home to three UK women's teams—basketball, gymnastics, and volleyball. In 1924, Alumni Gymnasium was completed. It included seating for 2,800 people and cost $92,000 to construct.[95] Kentucky played 271 games at Alumni Gymnasium from 1924 to 1950, going 247–24 (.911).[91][96] After a major renovation completed in 2018, it is now a student recreation facility known as Alumni Gym Fitness Center.[97] Woodland Park Auditorium, opened in 1906 and closed in 1941, was located on the corner of East High Street and Kentucky Avenue in Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky used this facility for home games during World War I between 1914 and 1916 going 15–7 there all-time.[91][98] The Wildcats played 84 home games at Buell Armory Gymnasium from 1910 to 1924. It was named for Union Civil War General Don Carlos Buell who was a member of the first board of trustees at Kentucky.[99] The armory was also used during World War I to teach truck maintenance and repair among other skills.[100] Kentucky was 59–25 all-time at Buell Armory Gymnasium.[101] The first home court for the Wildcats was simply called \"The Gymnasium\" or State College Gymnasium until 1910. It was located in the north wing of Barker Hall on the university campus. Constructed in 1902, it also housed the university's physical education classes until 1909. The facility had a capacity of 650 people, and with no bleachers or seats, fans had to stand to watch the games that were played there.[95] By the 1920s, it had become clear that \"The Gymnasium\" (by then renamed \"The Ladies' Gym\") was inadequate to house the university's basketball team. Records show Kentucky was 17–14 at State College Gymnasium.[91][100][102] (Of the 71 major categories listed above, Kentucky is No. 1 in 50 of them, No. 2 in 16 of them, No. No. 3 in 3 of them, No. 4 in 1 of them, and No. 8 in 1 of them.) Kentucky can also lay claim to several individual achievements for both players and coaches: Kentucky also holds several other NCAA records and various additional accomplishments:",

                "title": "Nvidia Reveals The RTX 5090: There’s Good And Bad News",
                "content": "Nvidia has revealed four of its RTX 5000-series graphics cards at the CES event in Las Vegas and there's good and bad news when it comes to pricing. The RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti And 5070 pricing was revealed as well as availability, with all four cards available from this month. Nvidia has revealed the pricing of four of its new RTX 5000 graphics cards - the RTX 5090, 5080, ... [+] 5070 Ti and 5070 With the pricing some cards are a lot more expensive, while others are cheaper compared to the original RTX 4000-series models. The RTX 5090 costs $400 more than the RTX 4090 did at launch, retailing for $1,999. The RTX 5080, though, costs $200 less than the RTX 4080 did at launch while the RTX 5070 Ti also sees a lower launch price than the RTX 4070 Ti by $50. Finally, the RTX 5070 will cost $549, which is a $50 price cut. This is probably not what AMD and Intel wanted to hear as they'd been focussing on the low end and mid-range with an emphasis on value and reigning in Nvidia's enviable market share. Price cuts for the likes of the RTX 5070 compared to the RTX 4070 is probably a worst case scenario so the graphics card market will be very interesting over the course of the next few months. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang delivers Nvidia's Keynote at CES 2025 In short, if you want an RTX 5090, it's going to cost you more. With everything else, you'll be paying less than you did with the original RTX 4000 series. This is a far cry from recent rumors that put massive markups on the RTX 5090 and 5080 expecially. There's been no mention of any cards below the RTX 5070 yet. Starting with the RTX 5090 and 5080, these will be available on Jan. 30 while the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 will be available in February. It seems Nvidia is skipping its own Founders Edition model on the RTX 5070 Ti, but will offer it on the other models, which will be available direct from its wesbite. The RTX 5060 TI and RTX 5060 are expected to make an appearance at some point in the near future, but as I left the keynote to head to bed here in the UK at 4am, no information had been revealed on those cards. That's to be expected, though, as the RTX 4060 and 4060 Ti took a few months to appear after the initial launch of the RTX 4000-series with cards such as the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080. Nvidia's RTX 5090 There's more good news, though, as the card revealed today was the Blackwell architecture-based RTX 5090 and the most obvious feature about the beautiful, sleek new Founders Edition cooler design is how small it is. The RTX 4090 (below) was a massive triple-slot graphics card and required significant clearance in PC cases. The RTX 5090, though, appears to be a whole slot thinner, appearing to be around two slots. The RTX 4090 Founders Edition was a triple slot graphics card This likely means other models could be smaller in size and this also raises questions about existing information relating to specifications and power consumption as none of the rumors even came close to suggesting a two-slot RTX 5090. It's certainly a far cry from the enormous Inno3D model revealed earlier this week. Partner cards are often larger, but the difference here is an entire slot of depth, which is a huge difference. It will be interesting to see what other examples arrive from other board partners and whether any of those will be dual-slot too.

                "title": "New GeForce RTX 50 Series Graphics Cards & Laptops Powered By NVIDIA Blackwell Bring Game-Changing AI and Neural Rendering Capabilities To Gamers and Creators  | GeForce News | NVIDIA",
                "content": "Powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell RTX architecture, GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards and GeForce RTX 50 Series laptops accelerate frame rates by up to 8X using NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, reduce latency by up to 75% using NVIDIA Reflex 2, enable next-level graphical fidelity for gamers and creators with NVIDIA RTX Neural Shaders, and much more. GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs and laptops deliver game-changing performance, power transformative AI experiences, and enable creators to complete workflows in record time. Rewatch the NVIDIA Keynote by NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang, below, and read on for all of the details. Neural rendering is the next era of computer graphics. By integrating neural networks into the rendering process, we can take dramatic leaps forward in performance, image quality, and interactivity to deliver new levels of immersion. The very first example of neural rendering was DLSS. We used lower resolution rendered frames as an input to a neural network, which was trained to output a full resolution frame. DLSS has since evolved to the point where it can generate entire frames and understand the composition of a scene including shadows, reflections, and occlusion to generate images that are better than native rendering. With the invention of DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, working in unison with the complete suite of DLSS technologies, we can multiply frame rates by up to 8X over traditional brute-force rendering and provide image quality that is better than native rendering. But DLSS is just the beginning. We've integrated neural networks inside of programmable shaders to create neural shaders. RTX Neural Shaders will drive the next decade of graphics innovations. They can be used to compress textures by up to 7X, saving massive amounts of graphics memory. And be used to create cinematic-quality textures, and even more advanced lighting effects in games. RTX Neural Faces offers an innovative, new approach to improve face quality using generative AI. Instead of traditional rendering, Neural Faces takes a simple rasterized face plus 3D pose data as input and uses a real-time generative AI model to infer a more natural face. The power of neural rendering with DLSS 4 can be seen in our new Zorah tech demo. The NVIDIA RTX Blackwell architecture has been built and optimized for neural rendering. It has a massive amount of processing power, with new engines and features specifically designed to accelerate the next generation of neural rendering. With up to 92 billion transistors, Blackwell is the most powerful consumer GPU ever created. The Blackwell streaming multiprocessor (SM) has been updated with more processing throughput, and a tighter integration with the Tensor Cores in order to optimize the performance of neural shaders. Blackwell is enhanced by several hardware and software innovations to improve Shader Execution Reordering. The reorder logic is twice as efficient, increasing the speed and precision of reordering which accelerates the performance of neural shaders. New Blackwell Tensor Cores have been built with a massive amount of AI processing horsepower, and support accelerated processing of FP4 precision models. With FP4, Blackwell Tensor Cores can not only process models faster, but can do so while using less graphics memory. To help support the frame pacing requirements of next generation DLSS Multi Frame Generation, the Blackwell architecture was built with enhanced hardware flip metering capabilities to provide the speed and accuracy required for a smooth, high-quality experience. Blackwell also features brand new RT Cores designed to ray trace massive amounts of detailed geometry. The RT Cores have 2X the ray triangle intersection rate of the previous generation, and enhanced compression designed to reduce memory footprint. This allows Blackwell GPUs to ray trace levels of geometry that were never before possible. Blackwell has also been enhanced with PCIe Gen5 and DisplayPort 2.1b UHBR20, driving displays up to 8K 165Hz. For GeForce RTX 50 Series laptops, new Max-Q technologies such as Advanced Power Gating, Low Latency Sleep, and Accelerated Frequency Switching increases battery life by up to 40%, compared to the previous generation. And in order to feed all this processing power, Blackwell is equipped with the world's fastest memory - GDDR7 with speeds up to 30Gbps. With G7 memory, Blackwell GPUs can deliver up to 1.8TB/s of memory bandwidth. On January 30th, the GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5080 arrive on store shelves. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5070 will be available starting in February. Limited NVIDIA Founders Edition models of the GeForce RTX 5090, GeForce RTX 5080, and GeForce RTX 5070 graphics cards will be available worldwide. And stock-clocked and factory-overclocked variants of all four GPUs will be available from top add-in card providers such as ASUS, Colorful, Gainward, GALAX, GIGABYTE, INNO3D, KFA2, MSI, Palit, PNY and ZOTAC. And in desktops from system builders, including Falcon Northwest, Maingear, Origin PC, and more. Thanks to the Blackwell architecture’s innovations and DLSS 4, the GeForce RTX 5090 outperforms the GeForce RTX 4090 by 2X. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty on GeForce RTX 5090 runs two times faster than last generation with the power of DLSS 4 With 32GB of GDDR7 memory, 1792 GB/sec of total memory bandwidth, 21,760 CUDA Cores, 680 5th Generation Tensor, and 170 4th Generation Ray Tracing Cores, it is the ultimate GeForce GPU, with more hardware and power than anything we’ve made previously (see the complete list of specs here). In games, DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation helps multiply performance in Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, and Black Myth: Wukong, enabling GeForce RTX 5090 owners to play at 4K 240Hz/FPS with full ray tracing and every other setting maxed out, for the definitive experience. In Generative AI applications, image generation is 2X faster with half the memory using FP4 on the GeForce RTX 5090, compared to FP16 on the GeForce RTX 4090. FP4 is a lower quantization method, similar to file compression, decreasing model sizes. Black Forest Labs' FLUX.1 [dev] model requires over 23GB of VRAM in plain FP16. On the GeForce RTX 4090, images are generated in 15 seconds. With FP4, less VRAM is used and the GeForce RTX 5090 can reduce image generation to just over five seconds. The GeForce RTX 5090 will be available from January 30th, starting at $1,999. Our limited NVIDIA GeForce RTX Founders Edition graphics cards are the pinnacle of design, built with premium materials, boasting striking, unique designs, and cooling innovations. For the GeForce RTX 5090, our engineers have created an unbelievable 2-slot, 304mm long x 137mm high x 2-slot wide, SFF-Ready Enthusiast GeForce Card capable of quietly cooling the high-performance Blackwell GPU inside thanks to a revolutionary new double flow through design.

Game with double the FPS. Create content and complete workflows in half the time. And finish generative AI tasks 2.5X faster. Blackwell Max-Q is designed from the ground up for efficiency, delivering a massive leap in performance and battery life. There are a number of Max-Q innovations in the Blackwell architecture that combine to make this possible. Advanced Power Gating technologies greatly reduce power by rapidly toggling unused parts of the GPU. Blackwell has significantly faster low power states. Low Latency Sleep allows the GPU to go to sleep more often, saving power even when the GPU is being used. This reduces power for gaming, Small Language Models (SLMs), and other creator and AI workloads on battery. Accelerated Frequency Switching boosts performance by adaptively optimizing clocks to each unique workload at microsecond level speeds. Voltage Optimized GDDR7 tunes graphics memory for optimal power efficiency with ultra low voltage states, delivering a massive jump in performance compared to last-generation’s GDDR6 VRAM.

                "title": "Antonio Pierce - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Antonio Durran Pierce[1] (born October 26, 1978) is an American professional football coach and former linebacker who was most recently the head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) in 2024. He previously served as the linebackers coach for the Raiders from 2022 to 2023. Pierce played nine seasons as a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) and he won a Super Bowl playing with the New York Giants in the 2007 season. He played college football for the Arizona Wildcats and was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Washington Redskins, and later played for the Giants. In 2014, Pierce began his coaching career as the head coach at Long Beach Polytechnic High School and then served as an assistant coach at Arizona State University from 2018 to 2021. Pierce played high school football at Paramount High School in Paramount, California. As a senior for the Pirates, Pierce earned All-CIF Southern Section Division 2 accolades at linebacker while also playing at the fullback position.[2][3] He then played two years of football at Mount San Antonio College in Walnut, California, before transferring to the University of Arizona. In the fall of 1997 as a sophomore, Pierce helped lead Mt. SAC to the CCCAA state title, intercepting a pass for the Mounties in the fourth quarter of a 38–35 win over San Francisco City College.[4] As a senior at Arizona, he had three sacks, 77 tackles (ten for losses), two forced fumbles, one interception, and one blocked kick, earning All-Pac-10 honorable mention.[5] Pierce was not taken in the 2001 NFL draft after his senior year because many NFL scouts considered him too undersized to play linebacker in the NFL.[6] The Washington Redskins signed him as an undrafted free agent in 2001. He played in all 16 games as a rookie, with only eight starts. He recorded 52 tackles, one sack, and one interception during his rookie campaign. The interception came against Jake Plummer. Over the next two seasons, Pierce played sporadically, recording only 18 and 15 tackles respectively, during the 2002 and 2003 seasons. It was not until the 2004 season, his fourth in the league, that he played a full season, upon replacing the injured Micheal Barrow.[7] That season, Pierce logged a career-high 114 tackles, 95 of them solo. He also had one forced fumble, one sack, and two interceptions, including a pick off Ken Dorsey returned 76 yards for a touchdown. The New York Giants signed Pierce on March 3, 2005, to start at middle linebacker. He became the captain of the defense, and in 13 games, Pierce notched 100 tackles, 80 of them solo, two interceptions, and one forced fumble returned for a touchdown. His 2005 season ended early as he suffered a leg injury, against the Philadelphia Eagles, and missed the final three regular season games as well as the Giants' only postseason game, a 23–0 loss to the Carolina Panthers. In 2006, Pierce recorded a career-high 138 tackles (109 solo), a sack, an interception, and defended eight passes. Pierce was named as a first alternate for the Pro Bowl. He was invited to play in Hawaii after Brian Urlacher suffered a toe injury in Super Bowl XLI, and withdrew from the Pro Bowl. In the 2007 season, Pierce was a central figure in the Giants' path to their third Super Bowl title. He made a key tackle in the first half of the NFC Championship game against the Green Bay Packers, stopping running back Brandon Jackson on a screen pass on 3rd and 8,[8] saving a touchdown and forcing the Packers to settle for a field goal instead. The Giants would go on to win in overtime.[9] On the early morning hours of November 9, 2008, at a night club in New York City, Plaxico Burress accidentally discharged an unlicensed gun in his pocket, injuring his thigh.[10] No one called the police, which is required by New York law when a gunshot accident occurs. Pierce helped Burress and rushed him to a nearby hospital to tend to his injury. Pierce was then sought by the NYPD for questioning as it is against New York law not to report a shooting, which Pierce or anyone else in attendance did not do. Eventually, Pierce talked to the police and did not face charges[11] in the incident, also reiterating he didn't have any regrets for how he handled the incident. Pierce was released by the team on February 11, 2010. Following his release, Pierce announced his retirement from football on July 8, 2010. He also stated that he would then begin his career as an NFL analyst for ESPN.[12] On February 7, 2014, Pierce was named the head coach at national powerhouse Long Beach Polytechnic High School, replacing Raul Lara, who stepped down as the head coach of the program after 13 seasons.[13] After an 11–2 first season, the Jackrabbits struggled under Pierce, missing the playoffs for the first time in 36 years in his second season at the helm. The struggles continued in 2016 and 2017, with the program failing to reach double digit wins in both years and getting blown out in the playoffs. On December 21, 2017, Pierce announced his resignation as head coach and was named linebackers coach at Arizona State University. After two seasons as the Sun Devils' linebackers coach, Pierce was promoted to co-defensive coordinator alongside Marvin Lewis.[14] On January 20, 2021, Pierce was elevated to be the sole defensive coordinator at ASU after sharing the role with Marvin Lewis during the 2020 season.[15] He resigned during an NCAA recruiting violation investigation prior to 2022 season.[16] In August 2023, ASU announced a self-imposed bowl ban, hoping to lessen further penalties resulting from the ongoing investigation.[17] Following Pierce's resignation, the NCAA investigation continued, eventually determining that Pierce was the, \"ringleader in orchestrating the recruiting violations\" at ASU, and that Pierce, \"used his position of authority to pressure staff members into engaging in violations, often by instilling fear that they would lose their jobs if they did not follow his orders\".[18] This included ordering an assistant to commit recruiting tampering to attempt to land a transfer not in the transfer portal, and refusing to cooperate with the investigation.[19] Pierce's actions were described as a \"scheme\" and involved Pierce taking individuals to a gentleman's club as part of recruiting visits.[20] The NCAA levied an 8 year show-cause penalty against Pierce; should an NCAA school hire Pierce prior to 2032, he would serve a yearlong suspension.[21] In a statement regarding the penalties, ASU president Michael M. Crow declared the university to be, \"disappointed and embarrassed by the actions of certain former football staff members who took advantage of a global pandemic to hide their behavior.\"[22] In 2022, Pierce was hired by the Las Vegas Raiders as their linebackers coach under head coach Josh McDaniels.[23] On October 31, 2023, Pierce was named the interim head coach of the Raiders following the firing of head coach Josh McDaniels.[24] He named Aidan O'Connell as the starting quarterback for the rest of the season on November 1, benching Jimmy Garoppolo.[25] On November 5, 2023, Pierce made his head coaching debut against the New York Giants, for whom he had previously played. The Raiders won the game 30–6, a season high in points for the Raiders at that point[26] On December 14, 2023, the Raiders defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 63–21, scoring the most points in franchise history.[27] A week later, on Christmas Day, the Raiders recorded their first win over the Kansas City Chiefs since 2020.[28] The Raiders were eliminated from playoff contention on New Year's Eve, following a 23–20 loss to the Indianapolis Colts. On January 19, 2024, the Raiders officially named Pierce the 23rd head coach in franchise history.[29] On January 7, 2025, Pierce was fired by the Raiders, after finishing 4–13 in 2024.[30] Pierce finished his tenure in Las Vegas with a 9–17 (.346) record. * Interim head coach Pierce is married to Jocelyn and is the father of seven. He currently resides in Palos Verdes Estates, California. His father, Cleo Burrows, is from Bermuda. Inspired by his own experiences growing up in Compton, it has become Pierce's mission to improve the quality of life for the youth in the Long Beach/Compton area. For several years, Pierce has offered a free football camp for underprivileged youths.[citation needed] In 2006, Pierce became the spokesperson for Giants Academy—a program for inner city youth geared toward helping these children succeed despite obstacles in their life. He is also involved in the \"Read Across America\" program where he reads to children whose parents are undergoing treatment for chemical dependency at the Odyssey House in Harlem.[31] In 2007, Pierce received the \"United Way Man of the Year\" award and was honored by the Catholic Diocese for his support of the community. Pierce was honored at the 2008 ESPY awards along with the Giants. Pierce was present when teammate Plaxico Burress negligently shot himself in the thigh at the Latin Quarter Night Club in New York City on November 28, 2008.[32] Police say that Pierce drove Burress to the hospital and then returned home with the gun in the glove compartment of his car. The police impounded Pierce's SUV to search for blood and gunpowder residue.[33] Burress was charged with, and ultimately pleaded guilty to, criminal possession of a weapon; however Pierce was not indicted on any charges. On August 3, 2009, Pierce was cleared of all criminal charges stemming from the incident.[34] He was represented in the matter by notable NYC criminal defense attorney, Michael F. Bachner.[35] Pierce served as a communications intern on The Howard Stern Show on May 7, 2008. He stated he would like to pursue a career in broadcasting after his NFL career.[36] Near the end of the day's show he asked to stay for the remainder of the week, which Stern agreed to.[37] # denotes interim head coach",

                "content": "Antonio Pierce reflects on his first full season as the head coach of the Raiders after going 4-13. (0:22) HENDERSON, Nev. -- Antonio Pierce is operating as if he will remain the coach of the Las Vegas Raiders after a 4-13 season, though he had yet to meet with team owner Mark Davis and general manager Tom Telesco when he addressed reporters in his end-of-season news conference Monday. \"I haven't been told anything different,\" said Pierce, who was wearing a throwback Raiders Starter jacket at the podium. Asked if he'd like his status \"cleared up,\" Pierce shrugged. \"It's only coming from the outside,\" he said of swirling speculation. \"It's not inside the building. To me there's nothing to clean up until I hear from inside the building.\" As such, Pierce said he did not anticipate making any changes to his staff in the wake of the team's fewest wins since 2018. It was also the first time the Raiders were winless against AFC West opponents since 2006. The Raiders endured a 10-game losing streak, their longest in-season skid since they began the 2014 season 0-10 and had the NFL's worst rushing attack. But Las Vegas did have the league's No. 10 total defense entering the season finale, a 34-20 loss to the playoff-bound Los Angeles Chargers. Raiders players credited Pierce for keeping them focused during a trying season. \"Shout out to AP because he kept the guys motivated, even when you're losing so many in a row,\" said receiver Jakobi Meyers, who had his first career 1,000-yard season. \"That's hard as a professional. That's hard as a competitor, in general. AP just did a great job in keeping us going and understanding what the goal is at the end of the day.\" Rookie Brock Bowers, whose 112 catches were the third most by a tight end in NFL history, echoed Meyers' words. \"I really liked AP as a coach,\" said Bowers, who was selected for the Pro Bowl. \"I know decisions are made and it's up to certain people and not us, so I don't have any control over that. But I really liked playing for him and I thought he was a great coach.\" Added quarterback Aidan O'Connell: \"He did a great job of [motivating], tried to speak to the guys that wanted to continue to fight. \"Guys continued to show up to work and do the right things and just tried to chip away.\" Pierce said he should have gone with his \"gut\" more this season and intimated he regretted not going with O'Connell at quarterback over Gardner Minshew to start the season. \"We've got to get better players,\" Pierce said. \"We've got to coach better. You've got to do a lot of things better when you only win four games.\"",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/las-vegas-raiders Things are not looking good in Sin City Once again, Raiders fans and analysts are left buzzing, as the Las Vegas Raiders have decided to part ways with head coach Antonio Pierce after just one full season at the helm. The decision, announced late Monday evening and confirmed on Tuesday, follows a tumultuous 4-13 season that saw the team struggle to find its footing. Pierce, who initially took over as the interim head coach in 2023 and was later appointed the full-time role, faced numerous challenges during his tenure. The Raiders dealt with instability at the quarterback position, inconsistent performances, and injuries that hampered the team's efforts to compete in the highly competitive AFC West. Despite a late-season rally where the Raiders managed to win two of their final three games, it was not enough to secure Pierce's position. The team's overall performance fell short of expectations, leading to the decision to seek new leadership. Related: General Manager Tom Telesco retained his position but still all eyes will be on him for the rest of his tenure, how long will it be. The Raiders released a statement after letting their former head coach go after a promising start to his job a year ago. \"We appreciate Antonio's leadership, first as an interim head coach and this past season as the head coach,\" the team said in a statement. \"Antonio grew up a Raiders fan and his Silver and Black roots run deep. We are grateful for his ability to reignite what it means to be a Raider throughout the entire organization. We wish nothing but the best for Antonio and his family in the future.\" The search for a new head coach begins immediately, with the Raiders looking for a leader who can reinvigorate the team and steer them back to playoff contention. Speculation is already swirling about potential candidates, with several high-profile names being mentioned in early discussions. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved.
