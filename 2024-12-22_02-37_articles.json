Jhon Duran and Morgan Rogers struck in each half for the home side at a lively Villa Park, with Phil Foden's strike in second-half added time proving scant consolation for City and their commendable away support. Pep Guardiola's side, beaten by Manchester United in last weekend's derby by the same scoreline, are now on a run of nine defeats in 12 games in all competitions and are without an away victory since October 20. They could find themselves 12 points adrift of league leaders Liverpool by Christmas depending on results later this weekend.

Erling Haaland MORE: All the latest Man City news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings Villa had three golden chances to score inside the opening three minutes, Duran forcing a save from Stefan Ortega ‚Äî in for the absent Ederson ‚Äî before the City keeper produced a remarkable reflex save to stop the ball being glanced in from the resulting corner. Amadou Onana then headed over the bar from close range. Duran made the most of his next opportunity, though, side-footing past Ortega after being set up by Rogers following a quite wonderful through ball from the outstanding Youri Tielemans. City dominated possession in the first half but found little joy against Villa's organised defence, with a misdirected Josko Gvardiol header from Jack Grealish's cross the closest they game to an equaliser. Villa took a more front-foot approach after halftime and should have doubled their lead before the hour. Matty Cash fired into the side netting instead of crossing for Boubacar Kamara for a tap-in, and Rogers drilled a shot off the outside of the left-hand post. Rogers made no mistake with his next chance. Having started the move with a strong midfield run that left Mateo Kovacic for dead, he received a pass from John McGinn and fired a left-foot strike into the bottom-right corner, with Ortega motionless in his goal. City heads seemed to drop and Villa looked the more likely to get the game's third goal, with substitute Ollie Watkins shooting straight at Ortega with a presentable opportunity. At the other end, Erling Haaland threw himself despairingly at a looping cross, having spent the whole game on the fringes. Foden ended his long wait for a Premier League goal when he slotted past Emiliano Martinez after Lucas Digne had slipped on the loose ball in the Villa box, but by that stage, a comeback felt implausible. City are now on a worse run of form than Erik ten Hag's Manchester United were before the Dutchman was sacked in late October. Guardiola will almost certainly not face the same fate, but quite how he turns things around this season is hard to fathom. That's that! City don't have time for a comeback. It's yet another defeat for Guardiola's team. 90+2 mins: GOAL! FODEN GETS ONE BACK! Savinho runs well with the ball and finds his teammate, who has a shot blocked but gets the ball back thanks to Lucas Digne's slip. Foden then has a simple finish into the bottom-right corner.

The champions are running out of time here. 82 mins: Rogers races away from Walker and plays a reverse pass to substitute Ollie Watkins, who shots straight at Ortega on his weaker foot. Guardiola throws his hands up and turns away in disgust. 79 mins: Villa are on the hunt for a third goal. City are very passive without the ball right now. It's not a good watch for any fans. 72 mins: Savinho is on for Ilkay Gundogan as Guardiola rolls the dice to try to get back into this game. 65 mins: GOAL! NO MISTAKE FROM ROGERS THIS TIME! The outstanding Tielemans combines well with McGinn, who sets up Rogers to drill a low shot past the motionless Ortega. Villa are in complete control now!

Gvardiol isn't strong enough with a challenge in his own box and the ball falls kindly the Rogers, whose low shot crashes off the outside of the left-hand post. He should really have hit the target. 57 mins: Akanji is going to continue, although he doesn't look entirely comfortable. 56 mins: Akanji makes a good sliding challenge on Duran, and both men stay down. Akanji looks to have landed awkwardly on his shoulder. This is the last thing City need right now. Duran is back up and looks okay. 53 mins: Onana, who has looked a bit of a passenger in the Villa midfield at times today, accidentally stands on the back of Foden's ankle. That looked a painful one for the City man, although he's back up on his feet. 51 mins: Duran smashes a finish past Ortega after being played through by Tielemans, but the flag goes up, and the striker seemed to be expecting it. He was indeed offside, although not by a lot. 49 mins: BIG CHANCE WASTED BY CASH! More brilliant Tielemans work in midfield sets up another swift attack. McGinn plays it to the overlapping Cash, who blasts the ball into the side-netting of Ortega's goal when Kamara was waiting in the middle for a tap-in! 47 mins: Rico Lewis is booked for stopping Tielemans on the counter. The City man has moved to left-back, with Walker on the right of the defence and Gvardiol partnering Akanji in the centre. City have made a change at the break: Kyle Walker is on for John Stones. The half ends as Grealish is halted by Cash again, and the City man then gets into a heated argument with Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, who has gone into the book. 43 mins: BIG CHANCE FOR GVARDIOL! The defender leads a City break, finds Grealish and continues his run into the box. Grealish's cross lands right on the full-back's head, but he's stretching for the ball and can't keep his attempt on target. 41 mins: The game has entered a bit of a lull. City are still struggling to pick their way through Villa, and the hosts have had a couple of chances to break quickly without making the most of them. 35 mins: City offer a glimpse of what they can do at their best, with Foden and Lewis combining well with some slick passes, but Martinez is equal to the former's shot. Duran clears the first corner, and the second is rather wasted. 27 mins: Gvardiol plays a teasing cross towards Haaland, but Pau Torres is able to clear. City are focusing all their attacks down the left at the moment. 23 mins: We're back into City possession and deep Villa defending, but so far, the home side are quite comfortable. City haven't got the ball to Haaland in any dangerous positions yet. 16 mins: GOAL! DURAN PUTS VILLA AHEAD! The No. 9 has a simple side-footed finish from the middle of the box after Morgan Rogers had squared it. But that all came from a simply wonderful throughball from Youri Tielemans, who came to receive a pass from his goalkeeper, turned away from pressure, and threaded the ball quite magnificently through City's defence and into Rogers' path.

The visitors have settled now, but the hosts are defending their box well. 9 mins: Grealish has had a lively start against his old club. Villa fans cheer as he is felled by Matty Cash, but this is a free-kick in a decent position for City. Villa just about clear their lines in the end. 3 mins: Amadou Onana has a near free header and sends it over the bar. That's another chance gone for Villa, and we've only had three minutes! 2 mins: HOW HAS THAT STAYED OUT? The corner is glanced on and Ortega gets fingertips to the ball to claw it away at the near post, and Erling Haaland clears. The referee signals that the ball did not cross the line ‚Äî but boy, that was close. That's how close Aston Villa came to opening the scoring inside 2 minutes against Man City üëÄüì∫ @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/jGQVWA9L93 1 min: VILLA SHOULD BE AHEAD! Josko Gvardiol is caught on the ball by John McGinn, and Jhon Duran has a clear run at goal. He tries a low shot from 25 yards out, and Stefan Ortega makes a good save to tip it behind. The Villa striker could have taken the ball closer to goal, there. Here we go! 5 mins before kickoff: Villa Park's traditional pyrotechnics are ongoing as the teams begin to make their way onto the pitch. 35 mins before kickoff: Guardiola told TNT Sports in the UK that Ederson \"is not here, he doesn't feel good\". He was happy to welcome back Stones and Akanji, though, despite a relative lack of preparation. \"They trained two or three times,\" he said. \"Of course, they are important players.\" Arrived at Villa Park! üëä#ManCity | #AsahiSuperDry pic.twitter.com/CMFNIXNKLr 1 hour before kickoff: Interesting team news for today: Jack Grealish starts against his old club, with Kevin De Bruyne on the bench. City are also able to welcome back Manuel Akanji to the defence, which actually looks solid on paper this time, although Ederson is not in the squad at all. Villa look to be going 4-3-3, with Amadou Onana starting in an imposing-looking midfield. Jhon Duran leads the attack. 1 hour 30 mins before kickoff: Guardiola is hoping for at least one return from injury today in the form of Manuel Akanji, but the news of Ruben Dias‚Äô weeks-long layoff was another blow in what is proving a hugely difficult season for the reigning champions. 2 hours before kickoff: City and Villa get us underway for this latest Premier League weekend ‚Äî the first of the busy holiday season. Pep Guardiola may be used to the packed December schedule by now, but he is certainly not accustomed to reaching this point of the season with his team in such disarray: they have lost five of their most recent seven Premier League games, as many as they had in their previous 67 matches combined. Manchester City were leading 1-0 at 87:10, but less than two minutes later (89:06) Manchester United lead 2-1 in the derby.Astonishing. pic.twitter.com/hTIBQ0b1Dx This Premier League match kicks off in Birmingham, UK at 12:30 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: Villa look to be going with a 4-3-3 set-up, with Amadou Onana coming into midfield to partner Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans. Matty Cash reverts to right-back, the Poland international having played on the wing during the defeat to Forest. Emery does not expect Jacob Ramsey to be back from a muscle issue until early January, but Leon Bailey is back on the bench after recovering from a \"small\" thigh injury. Tyrone Mings has sat out Villa's past three games in all competitions but is fit enough to make the matchday squad, having overcome an illness. Aston Villa starting lineup (4-3-3, right to left): Martinez (GK) ‚Äî Cash, Konsa, Torres, Digne ‚Äî Tielemans, Kamara, Onana ‚Äî McGinn, Duran, Rogers Aston Villa subs: Mings, Barkley, Buendia, Watkins, Nedeljkovic, Maatsen, Olsen, Bogarde, Bailey MORE: All the latest EPL club news | Team-by-team Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings News that Ruben Dias is facing four weeks on the sidelines represents another body blow to Guardiola, although Manuel Akanji and John Stones returning to the lineup means City's defence looks much more robust than it has recently. Rico Lewis is available after a one-match suspension and comes straight back into the lineup in place of the under-fire Kyle Walker at right-back. Jack Grealish starts against his former club, with Phil Foden the No. 10 in place of the benched Kevin De Bruyne. Goalkeeper Ederson \"does not feel good\", according to Guardiola, and is not in the matchdays squad. Erling Haaland has scored just three times in 11 league matches, but despite speculation of a falling out with Guardiola, he leads the line. Man City starting lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Ortega (GK) ‚Äî Lewis, Stones, Akanji, Gvardiol ‚Äî Gundogan, Kovacic ‚Äî Silva, Foden, Grealish ‚Äî Haaland Man City subs: Walker, Ake, Doku, De Bruyne, Savinho, Carson, Simpson-Pusey, O'Reilly, McAtee Here's how to watch this Premier League match across selected areas of the world's major regions: If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.

                "content": "Janusz Michallik believes Erling Haaland is \"absolutely useless\" when he doesn't have proper service following Manchester City's 2-1 loss to Aston Villa. Aston Villa inflicted more misery on shell-shocked Manchester City on Saturday, beating them 2-1 in the Premier League with goals from Jhon Dur√°n and former City forward Morgan Rogers. Villa rose above City into fifth place in the Premier League table, and the title holders dropped provisionally to sixth with their ninth loss in 12 games across all competitions. While Pep Guardiola's team could fall to as low as ninth by the end of the weekend and have just one victory to show from that 12-game stretch, the manager remains optimistic results will come. \"It can come, it can not come,\" Guardiola told the BBC. \"It depends on us. The solution is bring the players back [from injuries]. We have just one central defender fit, that is difficult. We are going to try next game -- another opportunity and we don't think much further than that.\" In a rip-roaring start, Villa almost scored inside 20 seconds when Duran pounced on a poor ball by Josko Gvardiol but his shot was pushed away by a diving Stefan Ortega. Ortega made another fine save from the corner that followed, batting Pau Torres' shot away off the crossbar. The narrow miss was a sign of things to come. Duran, 21, got the home side on the score sheet in the 16th minute when Youri Tielemans sent a sumptuous through ball to Rogers, whose unselfish pass found Duran free to fire home. It was a another statement for a permanent spot in the starting 11 by former Villa super-sub Duran, who started for the third successive league game, and has scored in all three. He also had a goal chalked off for offside on Saturday. \"We are in the process with the players [strikers Duran and Ollie Watkins], keeping their consistency of playing,\" Villa manager Unai Emery told TNT Sports. \"Jhon Duran today played fantastic, Watkins is fantastic as well, very important for us. Of course you have to work with both strikers, sometimes they play together. I am very happy with them.\" Villa Park erupted again in the 65th minute when Rogers latched on to a pass from captain John McGinn and finished with a low hard shot, leaving Guardiola to shake his head in frustration. \"It's like a beast, really,\" Rogers told TNT Sports of City. \"Because obviously they haven't had the results and we knew they would come out firing and they wouldn't want to win the game. We knew if we stuck to the game plan, and we showed our quality we would cause problems, and to a man, I thought we were outstanding.\" Phil Foden pulled one back for City in stoppage time with his first league goal of the season after a mistake by Villa's Lucas Digne, but it was too little too late for the visitors. Foden had City's best chances, including one in the first half that tested Villa's World Cup winning goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez after a one-two with Rico Lewis. \"We are disappointed, it's not good enough,\" City striker Erling Haaland told TNT. \"It's not good enough from me.\"",

                "content": "Justin Louis Baldoni (born January 24, 1984)[1] is an American actor and filmmaker. He is best known for portraying Rafael Solano on The CW satirical telenovela Jane the Virgin (2014‚Äì2019) as well as directing the romance drama films Five Feet Apart (2019), Clouds (2020) and It Ends with Us (2024).[2] Baldoni was born in Los Angeles, California, and was raised in Medford, Oregon, the son of Sharon and Sam Baldoni.[3] His mother is from a Jewish family,[4] and his father is of Italian ancestry. His paternal grandfather is Louis Baldoni, an Indiana senator and Italian immigrant.[5] Baldoni's parents joined the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, which Baldoni practices devoutly.[6][7] Baldoni played soccer and ran track in high school, and was a radio disc jockey at a local top-40 radio station. While moving into a new apartment building, Baldoni met a manager who advised him to pursue a career in acting.[8] He attended college on a partial athletic scholarship, but later dropped out.[9] Baldoni made his acting debut in the soap opera The Young and the Restless in 2004. In 2008, Baldoni wrote, produced, and directed his first music video that was selected and won him his first \"Audience Choice Award\" at Dawn Breakers International Film Festival.[10] In 2012, Baldoni created a digital documentary series, My Last Days, a show about living‚Äîas told by the dying.[11][12] The show eventually became one of the most-watched YouTube documentary series streamed online.[13] The second season of My Last Days aired on CW and third season was released in the winter of 2018. On the heels of that success Baldoni founded Wayfarer Entertainment, a digital media studio focused on disruptive inspiration.[14] In December 2018, Baldoni spoke at the annual End Well Symposium about why he believes that thinking about our death can help us live better.[15] From 2014 to 2019, Baldoni played Rafael Solano in the The CW satirical telenovela Jane the Virgin starring opposite Gina Rodriguez.[16] In May 2016 he launched a time-lapse video app for pregnant women and new moms called Belly Bump.[17] In 2018 he played a young Barry Minkow in the crime drama Con Man directed by Bruce Caulk. Baldoni directed and produced CBS Films' Five Feet Apart, starring Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson, and based on an original script by Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis. The film was released on March 15, 2019, and chronicles the lives of two teenagers living with cystic fibrosis.[18] The film was a financial success but received mixed reviews.[19][20] The following year he directed and produced Clouds, a film depicting the life of musician Zach Sobiech with Warner Bros.[21][22] On May 14, 2020, it was announced Disney+ had acquired distribution rights to the film from Warner Bros., in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. It was released on October 16, 2020.[23] In 2024 he directed, produced, and starred in It Ends with Us, based on the novel of the same name by Colleen Hoover.[24] The film was a box office hit earning over $350 million but earned mixed reviews from critics.[25][26] He acted opposite Blake Lively and they had a combative working experience with Lively accusing him of sexually harassing her and creating a toxic workplace environment. The New York Times investigated the incident which showed private messages from Baldoni attempting a smear campaign against Lively after she accused him of misconduct.[27] In July 2017, Variety announced that Baldoni was developing a male talk show through his media company Wayfarer Entertainment. The show, entitled Man Enough, is described as a disruptive panel series that explores what it means to be a man today.[28] In an interview, Baldoni described the reason he created the show. \"Man Enough really came about because I wanted to take a dive into what it really means to be a man, and this question of 'do we have it right?'\"[29] The show includes prominent men like Matt McGorry and Javier Mu√±oz.[30] In August 2017, TED announced Baldoni would be a speaker at the annual TEDWomen Conference.[31] In 2021, Baldoni released a book under the same premise as his previous talk show and TED Talk titled Man Enough: Undefining my Masculinity.[32] He began a podcast series under the same name with co-hosts Liz Plank and Jamey Heath. A children's version of the book Boys Will be Human was released in October 2022.[33] Baldoni founded a production company with Ahmed Musiol called Wayfarer Studios that produces television, films, and digital content. In 2019, Wayfarer sold majority stake setting up the $25M content fund.[34][35] The philanthropic branch of the company, called the Wayfarer Foundation, benefits homeless residents of Los Angeles.[36] They host an annual Skid Row Carnival of Love, which provides resources for employment, education, non-emergency medical care, food, clothing, hygiene, and other festivities such as face-painting, live concerts, and children's activities, serving over 4,000 homeless guests each year.[37] After almost two years of dating, Baldoni married Swedish actress Emily Baldoni (n√©e Fuxler) in July 2013 in Corona, California.[38] They have a daughter[39] and a son.[40] Baldoni has stated that he has ADHD.[41][42] In December 2024, Blake Lively sued Baldoni, with whom she co-starred in It Ends with Us (2024), for sexual harassment and for causing her family \"severe emotional distress\". According to the suit, Lively claimed she was in a hostile work environment. Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds had sit down meetings with the studio to address demands of Baldoni which allegedly included, \"not showing nude videos or images of women to Lively; no more mentions of Baldoni‚Äôs alleged previous ‚Äúpornography addiction‚Äù; no more discussions about sexual experiences in front of Lively and others; no further mentions of cast and crew‚Äôs genitalia; and no more inquiries about Lively‚Äôs weight.\"[43][44] Baldoni denied the accusations through his representatives who released a statement reading in part, \"It is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni\".[45]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. In May, Oleksandr Usyk completed his mission, defeating Tyson Fury by split decision to become the first undisputed heavyweight champion of the modern four-belt era. On Saturday in Saudi Arabia, Usyk will look for a repeat performance when he rematches Fury, this time with three world titles on the line. Usyk was stripped of the IBF championship for moving ahead with his contractually obligated rematch with Fury, though the lack of one of the four world titles from the first meeting has done nothing to diminish the excitement or importance of this rematch. The first meeting was the first time Fury had suffered defeat as a professional, having gone undefeated across 35 previous bouts that also saw him twice reign as world champion. Fury started that fight well, using his size and reach to keep the much smaller Usyk at range. Fury was so comfortable in the early rounds that he repeatedly danced and showboated, seemingly feeling he had the fight in hand. Usyk was able to make the necessary adjustments as the fight wore on and not only started to successfully use his boxing skills, but also scored a knockdown in Round 9. A perfect left hook landed on Fury and the following flurry from Usyk sent Fury's 6-foot-9 frame stumbling into the corner where it was ruled the ropes had held him up and thus counted as a knockdown. That knockdown was the difference between a split decision win for Usyk and a split draw, with one judge scoring the fight 114-113 Fury and two turning in Usyk scores of 115-112 and 114-113. Without the knockdown making for a 10-8 Usyk ninth round, that third card would have been 114-114. \"I've got nothing to say apart from there's going to be a whole lot of hurt and pain in this fight, you watch,\" Fury said. \"The talking's been done. The first fight, I talked, I joked, all my career. This time I'm serious, I'm going to do some damage here on Saturday night. Watch me go to work.\" Usyk's win ran his career record to 22-0. More impressive than his spotless record, Usyk has managed to go undisputed at two different weight classes. \"Now we just have the performance. Talks, cameras, lights, kind of show. Everything is going to be taking place Saturday night on the 21st,\" Usyk said at the final press conference. \"Don't be afraid. I will not leave you alone. See you on Saturday.\" Usyk ran through the cruiserweight division before winning the World Boxing Super Series in 2018 to unify all four world titles at 200 pounds. In October 2019, Usyk made the move to heavyweight with a win over Chazz Witherspoon. Two fights later, he'd defeated Anthony Joshua to capture the IBF, WBO and WBA heavyweight titles. \"Regarding the main event, I've got a lot of history with Oleksandr Usyk, but I am backing Tyson Fury. Of course, he's the Brit. People ask me all the time, \"who's going to win this fight?\" and I've said this: Oleksandr Usyk is an incredible fighter and it will take something extraordinary to beat him on Saturday night. But, and I know we've had our differences, Tyson Fury is capable of extraordinary things,\" Matchroom Boxing CEO Eddie Hearn said. \"His victory against Wladimir Klitschko in Germany, I watched that on a laptop in a hotel in America, I thought he had absolutely no chance. He won every single round. When he fought Deontay Wilder in America, I thought he had absolutely no chance. He was robbed in the first fight, he smashed him to pieces in the second fight. Two generational great heavyweights, two credits to the sport. May God bless you both on Saturday night, but most of all, I can't believe I'm saying it, may Tyson Fury be victorious on Saturday night for Britain and get the championship back.\" Now the two meet again with legacy on the line. Can Fury make the necessary adjustments to maintain his early momentum from the first fight or will Usyk again conquer the giant and prove his place atop the heavyweight division? The undercard was set to feature a solid matchup between Serhii Bohachuk and Israil Madrimov at junior middleweight. Unfortunately, Madrimov was forced to withdraw from the bout after suffering from bronchitis during training camp. His next appearance is expected to be on the Feb. 22 card featuring Artur Beterbev vs. Dmitry Bivol 2 in the main event where he will face another top contender in Vergil Ortiz. Instead, Bohachuk will take on Ismael Davis. Elsewhere on the card, more heavyweights give support to the main event. Rising teenage phenom Moses Itauma is back in action when he takes on veteran Demsey McKean. The 19-year-old has thrilled in his early career, scoring eight knockouts in 10 professional fights. His last was most impressive when he stopped veteran Mariusz Wach in the second round in July. He gets a durable veteran in McKean, who is coming off the first defeat of his pro career when he was stopped by Filip Hrgovic in August. Let's take a closer look at the rest of the undercard before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event. The image of Fury reeling along the ropes as Usyk was on the verge of scoring a stoppage is hard to shake from one's mind. Usyk was so good over the second half of the fight that it erased what was a tremendous early showing from Fury. What Fury needs to manage is to build that momentum without letting Usyk ever get comfortable. The biggest question heading into Saturday is whether Fury has developed a gameplan that can throw Usyk off, since Usyk figured out Fury midway through the first fight and never looked back. Fury has supposedly devoted himself to the craft in new and intense ways ahead of his second shot at Usyk. Still, it's hard to think that Fury can develop wrinkles a fighter of Usyk's skills can't adjust to. Expect a fight that might not be as thrilling as the first meeting, but that still produces some drama before Usyk again pulls away in the second half to retain his titles.

Don‚Äôt miss this chance to elevate your leadership and strengthen your union! In a historic vote, the House of Representatives has voted to repeal WEP/GPO and restore fairness to Social Security. Today, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness Act, by a vote of 327 to 75. H.R. 82 has been a top priority for the IAFF. The bill eliminates the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), provisions that unfairly punish retired fire fighters, police officers, teachers, and other public servants. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs vote was a major step toward ensuring fire fighters and other public servants receive the full retirement they‚Äôve earned and paid for,‚Äù said General President Edward A. Kelly. ‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôre proud of the work our team did to get this bill through the House, this is only half the battle. Now it‚Äôs time for Senators to step up and send this bill to the President‚Äôs desk.‚Äù The vote on the House floor was the culmination of a multi-year effort by the IAFF, which worked closely with lawmakers and their staff to stress the impact these unfair penalties have on fire fighters and emergency medical workers. Despite H.R. 82 being one of the most bipartisan bills introduced in the 118th Congress, the bill has been stalled in the powerful House Ways and Means Committee for nearly two years. Many believed that the bill‚Äôs detractors would successfully prevent it from coming up for a vote of the whole House. In September, the IAFF, along with Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-V.A.) and Rep. Garret Graves (R-L.A.) ‚Äì the bill‚Äôs leading sponsors ‚Äì led a successful discharge petition on H.R. 82. Discharge efforts give lawmakers a chance to bypass the committee of jurisdiction and send a bill directly to the House floor. While discharge petitions are rarely successful, 171 Democrats and 47 Republicans agreed to discharge the Social Security Fairness Act. While we‚Äôre proud of the work our team did to get this bill through the House, this is only half the battle. Now it‚Äôs time for Senators to step up and send this bill to the President‚Äôs desk. Now that H.R. 82 has passed the House, the bill moves to the Senate. Unlike the House, where the majority party can move legislation through the body relatively quickly if they have the votes, the Senate gives each Senator unique powers to slow down the legislative process. These powers include the right to offer amendments to legislation, and the right to speak on a bill. Because of this, the Senate must vote to end debate on a bill before it can be finally voted on and passed. This process, known as invoking cloture, requires a 60-vote threshold. Currently, the Senate version of the Social Security Fairness Act has 62 co-sponsors, meaning if all those who have co-sponsored the bill vote to invoke cloture, a vote on final passage would be guaranteed. The IAFF is asking all members to join the fight to pass WEP/GPO repeal. Senators need to hear directly from those most impacted by these unfair penalties. ‚ÄúNow is the time to make our voices heard to the Senate,‚Äù said Kelly. ‚ÄúOur fire fighters, emergency medical workers, and other dedicated public servants deserve to retire with dignity. Repealing the WEP/GPO helps ensure that.‚Äù Contact your Senators through the IAFF‚Äôs Advocacy Center and tell them to support the Social Security Fairness Act. Privacy Policy | ¬© 2024 IAFF.

                "content": "As coach MLB records Rickey Nelson Henley Henderson (born December 25, 1958), nicknamed Man of Steal, is an American former professional baseball left fielder who played 24 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for nine teams from 1979 to 2003, including four separate tenures with his original team, the Oakland Athletics. He is widely regarded as baseball's greatest leadoff hitter and baserunner.[1][2] He holds MLB records for career stolen bases, runs, unintentional walks and leadoff home runs. At the time of his last major league game in 2003, the ten-time American League (AL) All-Star ranked among the sport's top 100 all-time home run hitters and was its all-time leader in walks. In 2009, he was inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Henderson holds the single-season record for stolen bases (130 in 1982) and is the only player in AL history to steal 100 bases in a season, having done so three times (in 1980, 1982, and 1983). His 1,406 career steals is 50% higher than the previous record of 938 by Lou Brock. Henderson is the all-time stolen base leader for the Oakland Athletics[3] and previously held the New York Yankees' franchise record from 1988 to 2011.[4][5] He was among the league's top ten base stealers in 21 different seasons. Henderson was named the AL's Most Valuable Player in 1990, and he was twice the lead-off hitter for World Series champions: the 1989 Oakland Athletics and the 1993 Toronto Blue Jays. A 12-time stolen base champion, Henderson led the league in runs five times. His 24-year career elevated him to the top ten in several other categories, including career at-bats, games, and outfield putouts and total chances. His high on-base percentage, power hitting, and stolen base and run totals made him one of the most dominant and innovative players of all time. He was further known for his unquenchable passion for playing baseball and a buoyant, eccentric, and quotable personality that both perplexed and entertained fans. Once asked if he thought Henderson was a future Hall of Famer, statistician Bill James replied, \"If you could split him in two, you'd have two Hall of Famers.\"[6] Henderson was born on December 25, 1958, in Chicago, Illinois, in the back seat of an Oldsmobile on the way to the hospital. Henderson later joked, \"I was already fast. I couldn't wait.\"[7] He was named Rickey Nelson Henley, after singer-actor Ricky Nelson,[8] and is the son of John L. Henley and Bobbie Henley.[8] When he was two years old, his father moved to Oakland, California. Rickey lived with his grandmother in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, from when he was two until he was seven, when he migrated to Oakland with his family. His father died in an automobile accident 10 years after leaving home.[9] His mother married Paul Henderson in Rickey Henley's junior year of high school and the family adopted the Henderson surname.[8] As a child learning to play baseball in Oakland, Henderson developed the ability to bat right-handed although he was a naturally left-handed thrower‚Äîa rare combination for baseball players, especially non-pitchers.[10] In the entire history of Major League Baseball through the 2008 season, only 57 position players are known to have batted right and thrown left, and Henderson is easily the most successful player to do so.[11] Henderson later said, \"All my friends were right-handed and swung from the right side, so I thought that's the way it was supposed to be done.\"[12] In 1976, Henderson graduated from Oakland Technical High School, where he played baseball, basketball and football, and was an All-American running back with two 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He also ran track, but did not stay with the team as the schedule conflicted with baseball.[13] Henderson received over a dozen scholarship offers to play football. Despite a childhood dream to play for the Oakland Raiders, he turned down the scholarships on the advice of his mother, who argued that football players had shorter careers.[13][14] In 1983, Henderson married his high-school sweetheart, Pamela. They have three children: Angela, Alexis, and Adrianna.[12] Henderson was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the fourth round of the 1976 Major League Baseball draft.[15] He spent the first season of his minor league career with the Boise A's of the Northwest League. In 46 games, Henderson batted .336 and hit three home runs and two triples.[16] Henderson spent the following season with the Modesto A's. He batted .345 in 134 games during his record-setting season with Modesto. Henderson, along with Darrell Woodard, nearly broke the league record for team stolen bases. The Modesto A's finished the season with 357 stolen bases,[17] just shy of the league record of 370.[18] While Woodard tied the single-season player record with 90 stolen bases,[17] Henderson beat the record by stealing 95 bases, and was awarded the Sundial Trophy, given to the Modesto A's Most Valuable Player.[16][19] Henderson spent the 1978 season with the Jersey City A's of the Eastern League. After the minor league season ended, he played the 1978‚Äì1979 winter season for the Navojoa Mayos of the Mexican Pacific League. He played in six games for the team, which won its first championship.[20] In 1979, Henderson started the season with the Ogden A's of the Pacific Coast League. In 71 games for Ogden, he had a batting average of .309 and stole 44 bases.[16] Henderson made his major league debut with Oakland on June 24, 1979, getting two hits in four at-bats, along with a stolen base.[21] He batted .274 with 33 stolen bases in 89 games.[22] In 1980, Henderson became the third modern-era player to steal 100 bases in a season (Maury Wills 104 in 1962 and Lou Brock's 118 in 1974 had preceded him).[23] His 100 steals broke Eddie Collins' franchise record of 81 in 1910 with what were then the Philadelphia Athletics and set a new American League (AL) record, surpassing Ty Cobb's 96 set in 1915.[23] He also batted .303, had 179 hits (tied for ninth in AL), scored 111 runs (fourth in AL), drew 117 walks (second in AL), had a .420 on-base percentage (third in AL) and led the AL by reaching base 301 times. That winter, Henderson played in the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League; his 42 stolen bases broke that league's record as well.[24] Henderson was an MVP candidate a year later, in a season shortened by a players' strike. He hit .319, fourth in the AL, and led the league in hits (135), runs (89) and in steals (56). Henderson was also third in on-base percentage (.408), tied for second in triples (7), fourth in walks (64), eighth in total bases (185) and second in times reaching base (201). In so doing, he became the emblematic figure of Oakland manager Billy Martin's aggressive \"Billy Ball\" philosophy, which received much media attention.[25] Finishing second to the Milwaukee Brewers' Rollie Fingers in the MVP voting, Henderson's fielding that season also earned him his only Gold Glove Award. He later became known for his showboat \"snatch catches\", in which he would flick his glove out at incoming fly balls, then whip his arm behind his back after making the catch.[26] In 1982, Henderson broke Lou Brock's modern major league single season record by stealing 130 bases, a total which has not been approached since. He stole 84 bases by the All-Star break; no player has stolen as many as 84 bases in an entire season since 1988, when Henderson himself stole 93.[27] Henderson's 130 steals outpaced nine of the American League's 14 teams that season. He also led the AL in walks (116), was fourth in runs (119) and third in on-base percentage (.398). Inspired by Dodgers leadoff hitter Rudy Law, Henderson adopted an exaggerated crouch as his batting stance, which reduced his strike zone without sacrificing much power.[28] Sportswriter Jim Murray described Henderson's strike zone as being \"smaller than Hitler's heart\".[29] In 1982, he described his approach to Sports Illustrated: I found that if I squatted down real low at the plate ... I could see the ball better. I also knew it threw the pitcher off. I found that I could put my weight on my back foot and still turn my hips on the swing. I'm down so low I don't have much of a strike zone. Sometimes, walking so much even gets me mad. Last year Ed Ott of the Angels got so frustrated because the umpire was calling balls that would've been strikes on anybody else that he stood up and shouted at me, \"Stand up and hit like a man.\" I guess I do that to people.[30] Regarding Henderson's 1982 season, the mid-'80s book The Hidden Game of Baseball looked at such statistics as .78 expected runs with a runner on first and no outs, 1.07 expected runs with runner on second and no outs, and only .25 expected runs no one on and one out. The authors concluded that with Henderson's 130 stolen bases he contributed 22.2 runs to the A's offense. By being caught stealing 42 times, he cost his team 20.6 runs, and therefore, the authors concluded, the net effect of his running activity was merely 1.6 extra runs for the season.[31] A later analysis determined his net contribution was 5.3 runs for the season.[32] Henderson also made MLB history in 1983 with his third 100 runs/100 stolen bases/100 walks season (no modern player has done it once), when he led the AL in stolen bases (108), walks (103) while finishing fourth in runs scored (105). He was also second in on-base percentage (.414), tied for ninth in triples (7) and fifth in times on base, reaching 257 times. In 1984, Henderson hit 16 home runs while leading the league in stolen bases (66), finishing second in runs scored (113) and third in on-base-percentage (.399). After the season, he was traded to the New York Yankees.[33] As his muscular frame developed, Henderson continued to improve as a hitter. His increasing power-hitting ability eventually led to a record for home runs to lead off a game. During his career, he hit over 20 home runs in four different seasons, with a high of 28 in 1986 and again in 1990.[33] In December 1984, Henderson was traded to the New York Yankees along with Bert Bradley for five players: Tim Birtsas, Jay Howell, Stan Javier, Eric Plunk, and Jos√© Rijo.[33] In his first season with the Yankees, he led the league in runs scored (146) and stolen bases (80), was fourth in batting average (.314), walks (99) and on-base percentage (.419), seventh in slugging (.516), third in OPS (.934) and hit 24 home runs.[34] He also won the Silver Slugger Award, and was third in the voting for the MVP award. His 146 runs scored were the most since Ted Williams had 150 in 1950,[35] and he became the first player since Jimmie Foxx in 1939 to amass more runs scored than games played. Henderson became the first player in major league history to reach 80 stolen bases and 20 home runs in the 1985 season. He matched the feat in 1986, as did the Reds' Eric Davis; they remain the only players in major league history who are in the \"20/80 club\".[33][36] It was with the Yankees that Henderson, who had previously worn number 35 with Oakland, which was already taken by his Yankees teammate Phil Niekro, switched to his now famous 24, a number he would wear for the rest of his career (with two exceptions: (1) he briefly wore number 14 in 1993 while playing with the Blue Jays, (2) he wore his \"old\" number 35 in 2000 and 2002 while playing with the Mariners and the Red Sox, and (3) he wore number 25 while playing with the Dodgers). In 1986, he led the AL in runs scored (130) and stolen bases (87) for the second year in a row, and was seventh in walks (89) and extra base hits (64) while hitting 28 home runs (9 of which led off games) and had 74 RBIs.[37] In 1987, he had a below-average season by his standards, fueling criticism from the New York media, which had never covered Henderson or his eccentricities kindly.[38] Yankees owner George Steinbrenner issued a press release claiming that manager Lou Piniella wanted to trade Henderson for \"jaking it\" (playing lackadaisically).[39] Still, Henderson had his best on-base percentage to that point in his career (.423), with a .291 batting avg., was fifth in the AL in stolen bases (41) and hit 17 home runs despite playing only 95 games.[40] It was the only season from 1980 to 1991 in which Henderson did not lead the AL in steals. Seattle's Harold Reynolds led the league with 60 steals; Reynolds tells the story of getting an impish phone call from Henderson after the season: The phone rings. 'Henderson here.' I say, 'Hey, what's going on, Rickey?' I think he's calling to congratulate me, but he goes, 'Sixty stolen bases? You ought to be ashamed. Rickey would have 60 at the break.' And then click, he hung up.\"[7] In 1988, Henderson led the AL in steals (93), was third in runs scored (118), fifth in OBP (.394) and seventh in walks (82), while hitting .305.[33] Though only in New York for 4+1‚ÅÑ2 seasons, Henderson set the Yankees' franchise record with 326 stolen bases; the previous high (248) had been held by Hal Chase, who last played for the Yankees in 1913, when the team was still known as the Highlanders. On May 28, 2011, Henderson's total was surpassed by Derek Jeter,[41] who by that point had already played 1,700 more games as a Yankee than Henderson.[42] On June 21, 1989, the Yankees traded Henderson back to Oakland for Plunk, Greg Cadaret, and Luis Polonia.[43] After the trade, his 52 steals and 72 runs scored led the Athletics into the postseason;[33] his 126 walks for the year were the most for any AL hitter since 1970. With a record eight steals in five games, he was named MVP of the American League Championship Series; he hit .400 while scoring eight runs and delivering two home runs, five runs batted in (RBIs), seven walks and a 1.000 slugging percentage. Leading the Athletics to a four-game sweep over the San Francisco Giants and the franchise's first World Series title since 1974, Henderson hit .474 with an .895 slugging average (including two triples and a homer), while stealing three more bases.[33] On August 22, 1989, he became Nolan Ryan's 5,000th strikeout victim, but Henderson took an odd delight in the occurrence, saying, \"If you haven't been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you're nobody.\"[44] A year later, Henderson finished second in the league in batting average with a mark of .325, losing out to the Kansas City Royals' George Brett on the final day of the season. Henderson had a remarkably consistent season, with his batting average falling below .320 for only one game, the third of the year. Reaching safely by a hit or a walk in 125 of his 136 games, he led the league in runs (119), stolen bases (65), on-base percentage (.439) and OPS (1.016) was second in slugging percentage (.577), fourth in walks (97) and extra base hits (66), sixth in home runs (28) and total bases (282) and had 61 RBIs. Henderson won the AL's MVP award and helped Oakland to another pennant. He again performed well in the World Series (.333 batting, .667 slugging, a home run and three steals in four games), but the A's were swept by the underdog Cincinnati Reds.[45] On May 1, 1991, Henderson broke one of baseball's most noted records when he stole the 939th base of his career, one more than Lou Brock's total compiled from 1961 to 1979, mainly with the St. Louis Cardinals.[46][47] On July 16, 1993, Henderson broke the world stolen base record by stealing his 1,066th base, thus going past the record which was previously held by Yutaka Fukumoto. In 90 games with Oakland, he was batting .327 (second in AL) with 17 home runs and 47 RBIs. He also had scored 77 runs, stolen 31 bases, drew 85 walks, had a .469 on-base percentage and was slugging .553. In July 1993, the Athletics traded Henderson to the playoff-bound Toronto Blue Jays for Steve Karsay and Jos√© Herrera.[33] He performed disappointingly for the Jays, hitting only .215 in 44 games, which was probably due to the fact that he fractured a bone on his hand early on with the team, after being hit by a pitch, although he still contributed 22 stolen bases and 37 runs scored. However, his hitting woes continued in the post-season, batting .120 in the American League Championship Series and .227 in the World Series. Nevertheless, Henderson was involved in the final play of the World Series that year, as he and Paul Molitor scored on Joe Carter's Series-ending home run, one of the most famous moments in baseball history.[48] After the 1993 season, Henderson re-signed as a free agent with Oakland in December 1993.[33] In 1994 and 1995, Henderson finished in the top 10 in the league in walks, steals and on-base percentage.[33] His .300 average in 1995 marked his sixth and final season in the AL with a .300 or better average. Henderson signed with the San Diego Padres in the offseason. In 1996, he again finished in the top ten in the National League (NL) in walks, OBP, steals and runs.[49] On August 13, 1997, the Padres traded Henderson to the Anaheim Angels for minor leaguers Ryan Hancock and Stevenson Agosto, as well as a player to be named later.[50] The Padres acquired George Arias to complete the trade.[51] As an Angel, Henderson batted only .183 for the rest of the season. In January 1998, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Athletics, the fourth time he played for the franchise.[33] That season he led the majors in stolen bases (66) and the AL in walks (118), while scoring 101 runs.[33] In so doing, the 39-year-old became the oldest player to lead a league in stolen bases, and the oldest player to reach 50 steals.[52] A year later, Henderson signed as a free agent with the New York Mets. In 1999, he batted .315 with 37 steals and was seventh in the NL in on-base percentage.[53] Henderson was voted the 1999 National League comeback player of the year by The Sporting News. He wore number 24, which‚Äîalthough not officially retired‚Äîhad not been regularly worn by a Mets player since Willie Mays' retirement in 1973. Nonetheless, Henderson and the Mets were an uneasy fit. Following the Mets' loss in the 1999 NLCS, the New York press made much of a card game between Henderson and Bobby Bonilla. Both players had been substituted out of the lineup, and they reportedly left the dugout before the playoff game had concluded.[54] Henderson sought a raise on his $1.9 million salary for the 2000 season, but the Mets refused to renegotiate. He also feuded with manager Bobby Valentine and complained about traveling to Tokyo for the 2000 season opening series against the Chicago Cubs. Henderson batted .219 with no home runs and two RBIs before the Mets put him on waivers and granted him his release in May.[55][56] After his release from the Mets, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Seattle Mariners.[57] In his second game as a Mariner, on May 20, Henderson hit a leadoff home run, thus becoming the third player to hit a home run in four different decades (Ted Williams and Willie McCovey were the others).[58] Despite starting the season in the National League, Henderson finished fourth in the AL in stolen bases (31).[59] A free agent in March 2001, Henderson returned to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's record of 2,062 career walks,[49] Ty Cobb's record of 2,245 career runs,[60] and Zack Wheat's record of 2,328 career games in left field, and on the final day of the season (October 7) collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson in San Diego.[61][62] That final game was also Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play.[63] After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup. At the age of 42, in his last substantial major league season, Henderson finished the year with 25 stolen bases, ninth in the NL;[33] it also marked his 23rd consecutive season with more than 20 steals.[33] Of the ten top base stealers who were still active as of 2002, the other nine each stole fewer bases in 2002 than the 42-year-old Henderson.[64] In February 2002, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox, where at age 43 he became the oldest player to play center field in major league history when he replaced Johnny Damon for three games in April and another in July. Henderson's arrival was marked by a statistical oddity. During the 22+1‚ÅÑ2 years from his June 1979 debut through the end of the 2001 season, he had stolen more bases by himself than his new team had: 1,395 steals for Henderson, 1,382 for the Boston franchise. The Red Sox finally \"passed\" Henderson on April 30, 2002. At age 43, Henderson was the oldest player in the American League.[65] While playing in Boston, Henderson wore his old number 35, as his regular number 24 was already taken by Red Sox teammate Manny Ramirez. As the 2003 season began, Henderson was without a team for the first time in his career. He played in the independent Atlantic League with the Newark Bears, hoping for a chance with another major league organization.[66][67] After being named the Atlantic League All-Star Game MVP and receiving much media attention, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed him over the All-Star break. In 30 games with the Dodgers, he had 15 hits and three stolen bases, with a .208 batting average. Before the 2003 season, his last in the majors, Henderson discussed his reputation for hanging onto his lengthy baseball career: Each and every day I set a record, but we never talk about it. We'll talk about a home run hitter 24/7. Well, they haven't broken any all-time records, but they hit homers, and that's what matters nowadays. You continue playing, you accomplish a lot, and you'd think people would look at it as a fantastic career. Instead, Rickey thinks people want Rickey to quit more than anything.\"[68] Henderson played his last major league game on September 19, 2003; he was hit by a pitch in his only plate appearance, and came around to score his 2,295th run. Though it became increasingly unlikely that he would return, he continued to publicly debate his own official retirement.[69] After leaving the Dodgers, Henderson started his second consecutive season with the Newark Bears in May 2004.[70] In 91 games he had a .462 OBP, with more than twice as many walks (96) as strikeouts (41), and stole 37 bases while being caught only twice.[16] On May 9, 2005, Henderson signed with the San Diego Surf Dawgs of the Golden Baseball League, an independent league. This was the Surf Dawgs' and the Golden Baseball League's inaugural season, and Henderson helped the team to the league championship. In 73 games he had a .456 OBP, with 73 walks while striking out 43 times, and 16 steals while being caught only twice.[71] It would be his final professional season. Henderson would not accept the end of his major league career. In May 2005, he was still insisting that he was capable of playing in the major leagues. NBC and ESPN reported that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but his agent denied the report the following day. On February 10, 2006, he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets, while leaving the door open to returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he'd received to rejoin the Surf Dawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he'd had enough. Six weeks later, though, on August 11, he claimed \"It's sort of weird not to be playing, but I decided to take a year off\", adding, \"I can't say I will retire. My heart is still in it ... I still love the game right now, so I'm going to wait it out and see what happens.\"[72] On May 18, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided it did not \"infringe on the integrity of the roster or of the season\", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player.[73] A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, \"One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot ... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum‚Äîand I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody? ... Don't say goodbye for me ... When I want that one day they want to give me so bad, I'll let you know.\"[74] The Athletics retired Henderson's #24 on August 1, 2009.[75] Henderson finally conceded his \"official retirement\" on July 13, 2007: \"I haven't submitted retirement papers to MLB, but I think MLB already had their papers that I was retired.\" Characteristically, he added, \"If it was a situation where we were going to win the World Series and I was the only player that they had left, I would put on the shoes.\"[76] Contrary to speculation,[77][78][79] Henderson's refusal to officially retire had not been delaying his eligibility for Hall of Fame induction. Since the 1970s, the five-year waiting period has been based on major league service only. Henderson was elected as part of the 2009 Hall of Fame vote, in his first appearance on the ballot. At a press conference two days after his election, the 50-year-old Henderson told reporters, \"I believe today, and people say I'm crazy, but if you gave me as many at-bats that you would give the runners out there today, I would outsteal every last one of them ... they can always ring my phone and I'll come on down and help their ballclub, that's how much I love the game.\"[80] In 2011, on the 20th anniversary of his record-breaking stolen base, the Oakland A's held \"Rickey Henderson Bobblehead Day.\" At Henderson's insistence, the giveaway plastic dolls had one atypical modification: \"I told them, put a little dirt on mine, make sure that [it looks] like I'm playing the game.\" Almost eight years after his final game, Henderson also reiterated his desire to return: \"Sometimes when I sit around and look at the game and things ain't going right, I just think, 'Just let me put on the uniform and go out there and take a chance'.\"[81] The New York Mets hired Henderson as a special instructor in 2006, primarily to work with hitters and to teach base stealing. Henderson's impact was noticeable on Jos√© Reyes, the Mets' former leadoff hitter.[82] \"I always want to be around the game,\" Henderson said in May 2007. \"That's something that's in my blood. Helping them have success feels just as good.\"[83] On July 13, 2007, the Mets promoted Henderson from special instructor to first base coach, replacing Howard Johnson, who became the hitting coach.[84] Henderson was not retained as a coach for 2008. Henderson has periodically been a special instructor in the Athletics' spring training camps. In 2010, he worked on base stealing (most notably with Rajai Davis and Coco Crisp) and outfield drills.[85] Sports Illustrated's Tom Verducci wrote in 2003, \"There are certain figures in American history who have passed into the realm of cultural mythology, as if reality could no longer contain their stories: Johnny Appleseed. Wild Bill Hickok. Davy Crockett. Rickey Henderson. They exist on the sometimes narrow margin between Fact and Fiction.\"[86] Henderson notably refers to himself in the third-person.[87][88] According to Verducci, during one off-season, Henderson called Padres general manager Kevin Towers and left this message: \"Kevin, this is Rickey. Calling on behalf of Rickey. Rickey wants to play baseball.\"[29] However, Henderson denied that this happened in a February 26, 2009, interview on Mike and Mike in the Morning.[89] In 2003, he discussed his unusual phraseology, saying, \"People are always saying, 'Rickey says Rickey.' But it's been blown way out of proportion. Rickey says it when Rickey doesn't do what Rickey needs to be doing. Rickey uses it to remind himself, like, 'Rickey, what you doing, you stupid. ... ' Rickey's just scolding himself.\"[68] Henderson did use the first person pronoun on occasion, such as when he defended his position during a contract dispute: \"All I'm asking for is what I want.\"[29] Henderson was so proud of a $1 million signing bonus that he framed it instead of cashing it, thus losing several months' interest.[90] Similarly, Henderson refused to spend his per diem money that all players receive on road trips: instead, he would put the envelopes containing the cash in a box, and when one of his children performed well in school he would invite them to choose an envelope out of the box and keep its contents. In 2002, following an argument with pitcher Orlando Hern√°ndez, Henderson stated, \"He needs to grow up a little bit. I ain't a kid. When I broke into the game, he was crawling on his hands and knees. Unless he's as old as I am. He probably is.\" (Hern√°ndez is approximately seven years younger.)[91] There are many unconfirmed stories about Henderson. A Padres teammate (variously reported as Steve Finley or Tony Gwynn) once offered him a seat anywhere on the bus, saying that Henderson had tenure. Henderson supposedly replied, \"Ten years? What are you talking about? Rickey got 16, 17 years.\"[92] One widely reported story was a fabrication that began as a clubhouse joke made by a visiting player.[92] While playing for Seattle in 2000, Henderson was said to have commented on first baseman John Olerud's practice of wearing a batting helmet while playing defense, noting that a former teammate in Toronto did the same thing. Olerud was reported to have replied, \"That was me.\" The two men had been together the previous season with the 1999 Mets, as well as with the 1993 World Champion Blue Jays. Several news outlets originally reported the story as fact.[93][94][95] Verducci wrote, \"Rickey is the modern-day Yogi Berra, only faster.\" Henderson himself is resigned to his persona: \"A lot of stuff they had me doing or something they said I had created, it's comedy. I guess that's how they want to judge me, as a character.\"[86] It took a long time, huh [Pause for cheers] First of all, I would like to thank God for giving me the opportunity. I want to thank the Haas family, the Oakland organization, the city of Oakland, and all you beautiful fans for supporting me. [Pause for cheers] Most of all, I'd like to thank my mom, my friends, and loved ones for their support. I want to give my appreciation to Tom Trebelhorn and the late Billy Martin. Billy Martin was a great manager. He was a great friend to me. I love you, Billy. I wish you were here. [Pause for cheers] Lou Brock was the symbol of great base stealing. But today, I'm the greatest of all time. Thank you. On May 1, 1991, Henderson stole his 939th base to pass Lou Brock and became the sport's all-time stolen base leader.[46] Henderson's speech after breaking Brock's record was similar to the standard victory or award speech. He thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. Because his idol was Muhammad Ali, Henderson decided to use the words \"greatest of all time.\"[97] These words have since been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant,[98] although years later, Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock, and the Cardinals Hall of Famer \"had no problem with it. In fact, he helped me write what I was going to say that day.\"[99] On the day of the speech, Brock later told reporters amiably, \"He spoke from his heart.\" Brock and Henderson had had a friendly relationship ever since their first meeting in 1981. Brock pronounced the young speedster as the heir to his record, saying, \"How are we gonna break it?\"[7] Henderson has mixed feelings about his comments: As soon as I said it, it ruined everything. Everybody thought it was the worst thing you could ever say. Those words haunt me to this day, and will continue to haunt me. They overshadow what I've accomplished in this game.[68] At the end of his July 2009 Hall of Fame induction, Henderson alluded to his earlier speech, saying: In closing, I would like to say my favorite hero was Muhammad Ali. He said at one time, quote, 'I am the greatest,' end of quote. That is something I always wanted to be. And now that the Association has voted me into the Baseball Hall of Fame, my journey as a player is complete. I am now in the class of the greatest players of all time. And at this moment, I am ... [pause] ... very, very humble. Thank you. Asked if he believes the passage of time will improve his reputation, Henderson said: If you talk about baseball, you can't eliminate me, because I'm all over baseball ... It's the truth. Telling the truth isn't being cocky. What do you want me to say, that I didn't put up the numbers? That my teams didn't win a lot of games? People don't want me to say anything about what I've done. Then why don't you say it? Because if I don't say it and you don't say it, nobody says it.[68] Henderson had 468 more stolen bases in his career than Brock, one short of 50% more than the game's second-most prolific basestealer.[100] In 1993, Henderson stole his 1,066th base, surpassing the world record established ten years earlier by Yutaka Fukumoto for the Hankyu Braves in Japan's Pacific League.[101] In his prime, Henderson had a virtual monopoly on the stolen base title in the American League. Between 1980 and 1991, he led the league in steals every season except 1987,[102] when he missed part of the season due to a nagging hamstring injury,[103] allowing Mariners second baseman Harold Reynolds to win the title. Henderson had one more league-leading season after that stretch, when his 66 steals in 1998 made him the oldest steals leader in baseball history. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Henderson also owns the record for times caught stealing (335). Due to incomplete historical recordkeeping for that statistic, though, it is unknown whether he is the actual career leader.[104] However, Henderson's overall 81% success rate on the basepaths is among the highest percentages in history.[105] (Carlos Beltran ranks first among players with at least 300 career attempts, at just over 86%.)[106] On July 29, 1989, Henderson stole five bases against the Mariners' left-handed Randy Johnson, his career high, and one shy of the single-game major league record. Unusually, Henderson was hitless in the game (he had four walks). Henderson had 18 four-steal games during his career. In August 1983, in a three-game series against the Brewers and a 2-game series versus the Yankees, Henderson had 13 stolen bases in five games. Baltimore Orioles third baseman Floyd Rayford described the confusion he felt during a particular game, when Henderson was leading off first base and signalling him with two fingers. Henderson quickly stole second base, then third, and Rayford understood the gesture.[29] Longtime scout Charlie Metro remembered the havoc caused by Henderson: '\"I did a lot of study and I found that it's impossible to throw Rickey Henderson out. I started using stopwatches and everything. I found it was impossible to throw some other guys out also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it.\"[107] Joe Posnanski of the Kansas City Star and Sports Illustrated wrote: I'm about to give you one of my all-time favorite statistics: Rickey Henderson walked 796 times in his career LEADING OFF AN INNING. Think about this again. There would be nothing, absolutely nothing, a pitcher would want to avoid more than walking Rickey Henderson to lead off an inning. And yet he walked SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX times to lead off an inning. He walked more times just leading off in an inning than Lou Brock, Roberto Clemente, Luis Aparicio, Ernie Banks, Kirby Puckett, Ryne Sandberg and more than 50 other Hall of Famers walked in their entire careers ... I simply cannot imagine a baseball statistic more staggering.[108] Henderson was a headfirst slider. In September 2008, Henderson discussed his base-stealing technique at length with Sports Illustrated: I wanted to know how to dive into the base because I was getting strawberries on my knees and strawberries on my ass ... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [low-to-the-ground] technique from airplanes ... I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding ... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take ... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think.[109] Padres closer Trevor Hoffman said, \"I don't know how to put into words how fortunate I was to spend time around one of the icons of the game. I can't comprehend that yet. Years from now, though, I'll be able to say I played with Rickey Henderson, and I imagine it will be like saying I played with Babe Ruth.\"[29] When Henderson was 44 years old and playing for the Newark Bears in 2003, Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, \"I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.' ... I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody ... We've had some special players come through San Diego. But there's an aura about him nobody else has.\"[29] Tony La Russa, Henderson's manager in the late 1980s in Oakland, said, \"He rises to the occasion‚Äîthe big moment‚Äîbetter than anybody I've ever seen.\"[29] Coach Rene Lachemann said, \"If you're one run down, there's nobody you'd ever rather have up at the plate than Rickey.\" Teammate Mitchell Page said, \"It wasn't until I saw Rickey that I understood what baseball was about. Rickey Henderson is a run, man. That's it. When you see Rickey Henderson, I don't care when, the score's already 1‚Äì0. If he's with you, that's great. If he's not, you won't like it.\"[25] A's pitching coach Dave Duncan said of Henderson, \"You have to be careful because he can knock one out. But you don't want to be too careful because he's got a small strike zone and you can't afford to walk him. And that's only half the problem. When he gets on base he's more trouble still.\" Sportswriter Tom Verducci wrote, \"Baseball is designed to be an egalitarian sort of game in which one player among the 18 is not supposed to dominate ... Yet in the past quarter-century Henderson and Barry Bonds have come closest to dominating a baseball game the way Michael Jordan could a basketball game.\"[86] In July 2007, New York Sun sportswriter Tim Marchman wrote about Henderson's accomplishments: He stole all those bases and scored all those runs and played all those years not because of his body, but because of his brain. Rickey could tell from the faintest, most undetectable twitch of a pitcher's muscles whether he was going home or throwing over to first. He understood that conditioning isn't about strength, but about flexibility. And more than anyone else in the history of the game, he understood that baseball is entirely a game of discipline ‚Äî the discipline to work endless 1‚Äì1 counts your way, the discipline to understand that your job is to get on base, and the discipline to understand that the season is more important than the game, and a career more important than the season. Maybe he'd get a bit more credit for all this if he were some boring drip like Cal Ripken Jr., blathering on endlessly about humility and apple pie and tradition and whatever else, but we're all better off with things the way they are ... Everyone had their fun when he broke Lou Brock's stolen base record and proclaimed, 'I am the greatest', but he was, of course, just saying what was plainly true.\"[110] As of 2021[update], Henderson ranks first all-time in runs scored (2,295) and stolen bases (1,406), fourth in career games played (3,081), 13th in at bats (10,961), and 25th in hits (3,055). He has the second-highest career power‚Äìspeed number, behind Barry Bonds, at 490.4.[111][112] His record for most career walks (2,190) has since been broken by Barry Bonds; Henderson is now second but continues to hold the record for most unintentional walks (2,129). While his career batting average of .279 is considered somewhat modest for a leadoff hitter, his walks helped him post a stout .401 on-base percentage (OBP) for his career. He posted an OBP of at least .400 in 16 separate seasons, with a high mark of .439 in his 1990 MVP season. Henderson averaged 115 walks per 162 games over his career. Henderson also holds the record for most home runs to lead off a game, with 81; George Springer places a distant second with 56 career lead-off home runs. During the 2003 season, Henderson surpassed Babe Ruth for the career record in secondary bases (total bases compiled from extra base hits, walks, stolen bases, and times hit by pitch). In 1993, he led off both games of a doubleheader with homers. At the time of his last major league game, Henderson was still in the all-time top 100 home run hitters, with 297. Bill James wrote in 2000, \"Without exaggerating one inch, you could find fifty Hall of Famers who, all taken together, don't own as many records, and as many important records, as Rickey Henderson.\"[113] Henderson's eight steals during the 1989 ALCS broke Lou Brock's postseason record for a single series.[114][115] His record for the most postseason stolen bases was broken by Kenny Lofton's 34th career steal during the 2007 ALCS;[116] however, Lofton accomplished his total in 95 postseason games compared to Henderson's 60.[33][117] Henderson is the only American League player to steal more than 100 bases in a single season (having accomplished the feat three times), and he is the all-time stolen base leader for the Oakland A's.[33][118] In 1999, before breaking the career records for runs scored and walks, Henderson was ranked number 51 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,[119] and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[120] In 2005, The Sporting News updated their 100 Greatest Players list, and Henderson had inched up to number 50.[121] On January 12, 2009, Henderson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot, receiving 94.8% of the vote.[68] This was the 13th highest percentage in major league history.[122] Asked to choose the best player in history, Henderson declined, saying, \"There are guys who have done different things very well, but I don't know of anyone who mastered everything.\" Offered the chance to assess his own placement among the game's greats, he said, \"I haven't mastered the homers or RBI. The little things, I probably mastered.\" Of his various records and achievements, he values his career-runs-scored mark the most: \"You have to score to win.\"[123] Italics denotes active player",

Left Fielder Left Fielder Games Birth year Rickey Henderson used the ultimate combination of power and speed to break numerous records. Rickey Henderson used the ultimate combination of power and speed to break numerous major league baseball records during his career. But what solidified his place in baseball history was his love for the game. \"If my uniform doesn't get dirty, I haven't done anything in the baseball game,\" Henderson said. Born on Dec. 25, 1958 in Chicago Ill., Henderson spent most of his childhood in Oakland, Calif. An accomplished running back in high school, Henderson turned down multiple football scholarships to sign with the Oakland Athletics in 1976. In his first major league season 1980, Henderson broke Hall of Famer Ty Cobb‚Äôs 65-year-old American League stolen base record of 96 with 100 swipes. In 1982, he stole 130 bases, breaking Hall of Famer Lou Brock‚Äôs major league single-season record of 118. ‚ÄúHe's the greatest leadoff hitter of all time. I'm not sure there's a close second,‚Äù said Billy Beane, former Athletics general manager. He played for nine teams over his 25-year career including the Athletics, Yankees, Padres, Mets, Red Sox, Dodgers, Angels, Mariners and Blue Jays. He led the American League in steals 12 times and went on to be the all-time record holder with 1,406, earning him the nickname ‚ÄúMan of Steal‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt wasn't until I saw Rickey that I understood what baseball was about. Rickey Henderson is a run, man,‚Äù said Athletics teammate Mitchell Page. ‚ÄúThat's it. When you see Rickey Henderson, I don't care when, the score's already 1-0. If he's with you, that's great. If he's not, you won't like it.‚Äù His speed wasn‚Äôt his only skill. Henderson set all-time records for runs scored (2,295) and unintentional walks (2,129). The 10-time All-Star won the AL MVP Award in 1990, leading the league in runs scored, stolen bases and on-base percentage. He finished in the Top 10 in MVP voting five other times. ‚ÄúHe was one of the best players that I ever played with and obviously the best leadoff hitter in baseball,\" said Hall of Famer Dave Winfield. Henderson won two World Series during his career, in 1989 with Oakland and in 1993 with Toronto. He spent most of his career in left field and won a Gold Glove Award in 1981. He finished with a .279 batting average with 3,055 hits and 297 home runs. He electrified crowds with his flair and enthusiasm for the game. Henderson was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2009. \"There was only one Rickey Henderson in baseball,\" said George Steinbrenner, former Yanks chairman. \"He was the greatest leadoff hitter of all time.‚Äù Explore the archives and go deep into the lives, careers, and stories of the Hall of Fame's honorees. 1st Baseman Pitcher Catcher Left Fielder Pitcher 3rd Baseman Pitcher Catcher 1st Baseman

                "content": "(born 1958). American professional baseball player Rickey Henderson had many noteworthy years in his long major league career, but perhaps the most historic was the 2001 season. With his 2,063rd base on balls, he broke Babe Ruth‚Äôs all-time walks record. Months later Henderson became baseball‚Äôs all-time runs-scored leader when he crossed the plate for the 2,246th time, surpassing Ty Cobb‚Äôs record set in 1928. As the season closed, Henderson reached the coveted 3,000-career-base-hits mark. He ended the 2001 season with 2,141 walks. (The career walk record was broken again by Barry Bonds in 2004.) Rickey Henley Henderson was born on December 25, 1958, in Chicago, Illinois. An All-American running back in football as a high school athlete in Oakland, California, Henderson nevertheless decided to pursue a baseball career. He played in the minor leagues from 1976‚Äì79. Henderson made his major league debut with the Oakland Athletics in June 1979. Although he was a right-handed batter, the outfielder threw with his left hand. Henderson quickly gained a reputation for his speed, and he mostly batted in the leadoff position. In 1980, his first full season, he became only the third person in modern baseball history ever to steal 100 bases, breaking Cobb‚Äôs American League record of 96 bases. It was the first of seven consecutive seasons in which Henderson led the American League in stolen bases. In 1982 he broke Lou Brock‚Äôs single-season record of 118 stolen bases, set in 1974, with 130 stolen bases. Henderson became baseball‚Äôs top all-time base stealer when he swiped the 939th base of his career in 1991, breaking Brock‚Äôs major league record. By the end of the 2002 season, Henderson had accumulated 1,403 career stolen bases. Oakland traded Henderson to the New York Yankees after the 1984 season. He was traded back to the Athletics midway through the 1989 season and helped Oakland win the World Series. In 1990 Henderson was selected as the American League‚Äôs Most Valuable Player (MVP)‚Äîhitting 28 home runs, scoring 119 runs, stealing 65 bases, and batting .325. Midway through 1993, Henderson was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays, where he was again part of a World Series championship team. Teams that the multitime all-star played for in the latter part of his career included Oakland (1994‚Äì95, 1998), the San Diego Padres (1996‚Äì97, 2001), the Anaheim Angels (1997), the New York Mets (1999‚Äì2000), and the Seattle Mariners (2000). Though he was known for having a brash personality, fans of the Athletics voted Henderson Oakland‚Äôs Player of the Century. Henderson‚Äôs autobiography, Off Base, was published in 1992. Many people believed Henderson would retire after having reached so many milestones in 2001, but he kept playing. Henderson last appeared in a major league game in September 2003, but he continued to play for independent minor league teams over the following two years. Henderson officially retired from baseball in 2007. Two years later he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.

                "title": "Rickey Henderson the ultimate Christmas gift",
                "content": "Manny Randhawa Nobody has stolen more bases. Nobody has scored more runs. Nobody has hit more leadoff homers -- or celebrated them as magnificently. He‚Äôs the greatest leadoff man in MLB history. And the ultimate Christmas present to the baseball fan. Rickey Henderson was born in Chicago on Christmas Day in 1958, and the baseball world had no idea at the time what a momentous gift had just been bestowed upon it. Let‚Äôs break down the many ways in which Rickey brought us joy throughout a Hall of Fame career that spanned a quarter of a century. The stolen base was Henderson‚Äôs calling card. His first came in his first MLB game, the opener of a doubleheader between the A‚Äôs and Rangers on June 24, 1979, at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, fewer than 10 miles from where the A's drafted him -- Oakland Technical High School. Henderson‚Äôs last came 24 years later (fittingly for a man who wore No. 24 most of his career), when he stole second base for the Dodgers in the third inning of a game against the Rockies at Dodger Stadium on Aug. 29, 2003. And he swiped 1,404 bags in between. Henderson led the American League in steals 12 times and led the Majors in six of those years. He stole more than 100 bases in a season three times, including a record 130 steals in 1982 for Oakland. In 1991, with a swipe of third base against the Yankees at the Coliseum on May 1, Henderson eclipsed Hall of Famer Lou Brock with his record 939th career steal. Then he ran away with the title -- Brock remains in second place all-time, 468 steals behind the stolen base king. Henderson revolutionized the head-first slide, violently flying into the bag he was headed for. There had been head-first slides before -- think Pete Rose -- but the fluidity and aggression with which Henderson perfected it added a flair reminiscent of the end of a quick paint brush stroke. He turned the stolen base into art. Henderson hit 297 home runs during his career, including a career-high 28 in 1986 with the Yankees, as well as in a 1990 AL MVP campaign with the A‚Äôs. He set the benchmark for the leadoff hitter in every conceivable way, and that includes power -- he hit a record 81 home runs to open a contest. And when it came to admiring his homers, Rickey was unmatched in his creativity. There was the helmet tap, the tugging of the jersey collar, the wide -- and we mean wide -- turn around first base, and the good old-fashioned bat flip. As with everything he did, Rickey brought something extra to his homers. And the power-speed combination made him unique among leadoff hitters in his era, when contact/slap-hitters who could beat out infield singles and then use their wheels to help manufacture a run were ubiquitous. Sure, Rickey could do that. But he could do everything else, too. Henderson drew more walks in his career than Babe Ruth. It‚Äôs no wonder he finished with a .401 on-base percentage. Until Barry Bonds broke it in 2006, Henderson owned the all-time record for career walks, with 2,190. Henderson still owns the all-time record for unintentional walks, with 2,129. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Henderson‚Äôs legend is perhaps most revered for the element of sheer domination he brought to the diamond every time he stepped onto it. You walk Rickey Henderson to open the game, the saying would go, and you‚Äôre already down a run. The quintessential demonstration of this came during the 1989 AL Championship Series between the A‚Äôs and Blue Jays, when Henderson was named MVP after hitting .400 with a double, triple, two homers, eight steals and eight runs scored in five games. He made 23 plate appearances and reached base 14 times (.609 on-base percentage). Four of his steals came in Game 2 alone. And he wasn‚Äôt thrown out trying to steal once. Henderson was also famously known for referring to himself in the third person. MLB Network analyst Harold Reynolds shared a story for \"MLB Network Presents: School of Rickey\" in which he described a phone conversation with Rickey the day after winning the AL stolen base title in 1987 (Henderson was limited to 95 games that year due to injury; it was the only year in the 1980s he did not lead the league in steals). \"I go over and pick up the phone,\" Reynolds recalled, \"[and he said] 'Henderson here,' because he speaks in the third person regardless. ... He says '60 stolen bases? You ought to be ashamed -- Rickey would have 60 at the All-Star break.' Click. Hung up.\" Stories about Henderson abound, and they‚Äôve become the stuff of legend. Some are true, some aren‚Äôt. But they‚Äôre all tremendously entertaining. Take, for instance, the tale of when Rickey got his signing bonus upon being drafted in 1976 -- he got a call one day that December from the A‚Äôs accounting department, asking why he hadn‚Äôt cashed his $1 million check yet. Henderson later confirmed what his response was: ‚ÄúI said [the check] was on my wall.‚Äù Rickey determined as a kid that when he became a millionaire, he‚Äôd frame the check. He‚Äôs a man of his word. Or how about when Rickey, a Mariner at the time, was standing around the batting cage with some teammates, including John Olerud? Olerud is remembered as a great hitter, one who flirted with a .400 batting average deep into the 1993 season with the Blue Jays -- Henderson was his teammate on that club, too. Olerud is also remembered for always wearing a helmet while in the field at first base because of a brain aneurysm he had in college. According to Henderson lore, Rickey asked Olerud about it one day, and then mentioned he once played with a guy in New York who did that. ‚ÄúYeah, Rickey, that was me,‚Äù said Olerud, as the story goes. (Olerud and Henderson were teammates on the Mets from 1999-2000.) That one, though, wasn‚Äôt true, Henderson later said. Olerud himself confirmed the fiction. There will never be another Rickey Henderson. It's always fun to look back on his illustrious career, since it gives us the chance to watch in awe all over again as he does things no one did before, nor has since. Since there's never a bad time to watch Rickey highlights, it's a good thing his birthday is easy to remember. He is, after all, one of the greatest Christmas presents baseball has ever received.",

Rickey Henderson (born December 25, 1958, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) is a professional baseball player who in 1991 set a record for the most stolen bases in major league baseball and in 2001 set a record for the most career runs scored. Henderson was an All-American running back in football as a high school athlete in Oakland, California. He chose to play baseball over football, however, and competed in the minor leagues for four seasons. Henderson‚Äôs career in the major leagues began with the Oakland Athletics in June 1979. In 1980, his first full season, he became one of only three players ever to have stolen 100 bases, breaking Ty Cobb‚Äôs American League record of 96 bases. It was the first of seven consecutive seasons in which Henderson led the American League in stolen bases. In 1982 he broke Lou Brock‚Äôs single-season record of 118 stolen bases, set in 1974, with 130 stolen bases. Henderson added 108 stolen bases the following year. Henderson was traded to the New York Yankees after the 1984 season but was traded back to Oakland midway through the 1989 season and helped the Athletics win the World Series. In 1990 Henderson‚Äîhaving hit 28 home runs, scored 119 runs, stolen 65 bases, and batted .325‚Äîwas selected American League Most Valuable Player. He set the American League career stolen-base record that year with his 893rd steal, again breaking a mark set by Cobb. Henderson stole the 939th base of his career in 1991, breaking Brock‚Äôs major league record. Henderson played for numerous teams in the 1990s. His frequent trades to different teams were fueled in part by contract disputes and the perception that he was not a team player. The 2001 season was a landmark for Henderson. On April 25, while a member of the San Diego Padres, he broke Babe Ruth‚Äôs lifetime record for bases on balls (walks). When Ruth retired from baseball in 1935, he had 2,062 bases on balls, a testament to his ability to judge pitches and intimidate pitchers, and it was thought that the record would never be broken. Ted Williams (with 2,019) had been the only other player to even top 2,000 walks until Henderson, who ended the 2001 season with 2,141 walks. (The career walk record was broken again by Barry Bonds in 2004.) Henderson continued his record-breaking season on October 4, setting the all-time record for runs scored. His 2,246th run broke the career record for runs held by Ty Cobb, which had stood since Cobb‚Äôs retirement in 1928. On October 7, the last day of the 2001 regular season, Henderson became only the 25th player in major league history to have recorded 3,000 hits. He last appeared in a major league game in September 2003, but he continued to play for independent minor league teams over the following two years. Henderson officially retired from baseball in 2007. Two years later he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. His autobiography, Off Base: Confessions of a Thief, was published in 1992.",

                "title": "Texan English - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Texan English is the array of American English dialects spoken in Texas, primarily falling under Southern U.S. English. As one nationwide study states, the typical Texan accent is a \"Southern accent with a twist\".[1] The \"twist\" refers to inland Southern U.S., older coastal Southern U.S., and South Midland U.S. accents mixing together, due to Texas's settlement history, as well as some lexical (vocabulary) influences from Mexican Spanish.[1] In fact, there is no single accent that covers all of Texas and few dialect features are unique to Texas alone. The newest and most innovative Southern U.S. accent features are best reported in Lubbock, Odessa, somewhat Houston and variably Dallas, though general features of this same dialect are found throughout the state, with several exceptions:[2] Abilene and somewhat Austin, Corpus Christi, and El Paso appear to align more with Midland U.S. accents than Southern ones. After Mexico gained independence in 1821, Mexican Texas legally permitted an influx of American settlers from the United States (mainly the Southern United States),[3] who within a decade outnumbered Hispanics in Texas,[4] making English as common as Spanish in central and north Texas. After Texas became an independent republic in 1836, English, with its distinct Southern influences, became the predominant language. After the Mexican Revolution of 1910‚Äì1920, a great number of Spanish-speaking Mexicans immigrated to Texas,[5][6] slowing down in the mid-20th century only to increase massively since 1990,[4] driving the development of a young Spanish-influenced dialect of Texan English: Tejano English. Some linguists draw dialect boundaries based upon phonological (sound-pattern) differences and others on lexical (word-usage) differences, leading to various views on how to classify dialects in Texas, often by dividing the state into an eastern versus a western dialect region.[7] 20th-century lexical research delimited Texas into two \"layers\": a southern Texas layer along the Mexican border with several Spanish loanwords and a central Texas layer settled by speakers of German and other European languages amidst a dominant Anglo-American settlement.[8][9] 21st-century phonological research reveals accents in Texas grouped in a way not easy to demarcate in terms of simple geographical boundaries,[10] and ongoing research reveals an urban‚Äìrural divide within Texas becoming more significant than a region-wide divide. Some linguists propose that urbanization, geographic and social mobility, and the mass media have homogenized the speech of the United States to a national norm.[11] Due to rapid urbanization, increasing dominance of high tech industries, and massive migrations, Texan speech has been reshaped as well, especially since 1990.[4] The general tendency in the phonology of Texas English is that mergers expand at the expense of distinctions, although traditional Southern-style Texan English preserved older phonemic distinctions.[11] Since much of the traditional regional vocabulary concerned farming and rural life, these terms are now disappearing or being replaced by technical terms.[11] As stated above, an internal rural‚Äìurban split is emerging within Texan English, meaning that most traditionally Southern (or stereotypically Texan) features remain strong in rural areas but tend to disappear in large urban areas and small cities.[4] The urban-rural linguistic split mainly affects Southern-style phonological phenomena like the pen-pin merger, the loss of the offglide in /a…™/, and upgliding diphthongs, all of which are now recessive in metropolitan areas.[4] Meanwhile, some traditional grammatical features like y'all and fixin' to are expanding to non-natives in metropolitan areas as well as to the Hispanic population.[4] Essentially all Texas English phonologically falls under the Southeastern super-dialect region of the United States and often specifically the Southern dialect region, though noticeably not the cities of El Paso, Abilene, and Austin, and not particularly Houston and Corpus Christi.[2] Moreover, as of 21st-century research, the accents of Dallas show enormous variability.[10] Texas English may use many grammatical constructions typically associated with Southern U.S. English, including fixin' to,[19] multiple modals like might could and should oughta (reportedly used by every social class and, as of the 1980s Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, predominately in Upper and Lower East Texas), and plural verbal -s as in Our father and mother helps used by both Black and (somewhat less commonly) white Texans.[20] Many of these lexical terms are shared with the Midland and Southern dialects generally: Due to Spain's past influence in Texas, the vocabulary of Texas is much more influenced by Spanish than the vocabulary of other states. Some of the Texan terms that originated from Spanish are listed below.[22] Texan English frequently shows up in the media. In the 1950s and 1960s, many Hollywood western movies like Giant, Hud, and The Alamo were set in Texas. In those movies, Hollywood stars like James Dean, Rock Hudson, Dennis Hopper, Paul Newman, and Patricia Neal first had to learn how to speak Texan English and were instructed by native Texans. Also the famous TV series Dallas was often characterized by Texan English. Texas Instruments sometimes uses Texan English in its products. The TIFORM software for its TI-990 minicomputer sometimes displayed \"Shut 'er Down Clancey She's a-Pumping Mud\" as a humorous error message.[28] The Texan accent gained nationwide fame with the presidency of native Texan Lyndon B. Johnson. A lifelong resident of the Texas Hill Country, Johnson's thick accent was a large part of his personality and brought attention and fame to the dialect.[4][29] The Texan dialect gained fame again when George W. Bush started to serve as president. He had moved to West Texas at the age of two and has since retained the Texan dialect. In his speech, words like \"America\" sometimes sound like \"Amur-kah\" or even just like \"Mur-kah\".[4][30] Former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also speaks with a distinctively Texan accent.[31][32] Due to hundreds of years of Spanish and later Mexican intermingling, around 6 million (ca. 29%) people in Texas speak Spanish as the first language.[33] Recent data shows that Spanish is still increasing.[34] Since there are so many Spanish speakers in Texas, Spanish has a high impact on the English dialect spoken in Texas.[35] Many Mexican Americans in Texas speak their own variety of English which has many Spanish features (terms, phonology, etc.), Tejano English, a Chicano English dialect mostly spoken by working-class Mexican Americans. A very distinctive feature of that dialect is the /-t,d/-deletion in words which contain a /t/ or /d/ in the final position.[36]",

                "content": "The Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team is the college football team representing the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, north of the city of South Bend, Indiana. The team plays its home games at the campus's Notre Dame Stadium, which has a capacity of 77,622. Notre Dame is one of three schools that competes as an Independent at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) level; however, they play five games a year against opponents from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), of which Notre Dame is a member in all other sports except ice hockey.[5] The Fighting Irish are among the most prestigious college football teams of all time. Since their inaugural season in 1887, Notre Dame has claimed 11 national championships, including 8 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[6] Seven Notre Dame players have won the Heisman Trophy. Notre Dame has 948 official victories, with an additional 21 having been vacated by the NCAA in 2016 for self-reported academic misconduct.[7] Notre Dame has had 22 undefeated seasons including 12 perfect seasons.[8] Notre Dame home games have been televised by NBC since 1991.[9][10] Football did not have an auspicious beginning at the University of Notre Dame. In their inaugural game on November 23, 1887, the Irish lost to Michigan by a score of 8‚Äì0.[11] Their first win came in the final game of the 1888 season when the Irish defeated Harvard Prep School of Chicago by a score of 20‚Äì0.[12] At the end of the 1888 season, they had a record of 1‚Äì3 with all three losses being at the hands of Michigan. Between 1887 and 1899, Notre Dame compiled a record of 31 wins, 15 losses, and 4 ties against a diverse variety of opponents ranging from local high school teams to other universities.[13] In 1894, James L. Morrison was hired as Notre Dame's first head football coach.[14] Notre Dame took a significant step toward respectability, prominence, and stability when they hired Morrison.[15] He wrote an acquaintance after his first day on the job: \"I arrived here [Notre Dame] this morning and found about as green a set of football players that ever donned a uniform... They want to smoke, and when I told them that they would have to run and get up some wind, they thought I was rubbing it in on them. \"One big, strong cuss remarked that it was too much like work. Well, maybe you think I didn't give him hell! I bet you a hundred no one ever makes a remark like that again.\"[15] In 1908, the win over Franklin saw end Fay Wood catch the first touchdown pass in Notre Dame history.[16] Notre Dame continued its success near the turn of the century and achieved their first victory over Michigan in 1909 by the score of 11‚Äì3, after which Michigan refused to play Notre Dame again for 33 years. By the end of the 1912 season they had amassed a record of 108 wins, 31 losses, and 13 ties.[17] Jesse Harper became head coach in 1913, coaching for five years until retiring in 1917.[18] During his tenure, the Irish began playing only intercollegiate games and posted a record of 34 wins, five losses, and one tie.[19] This period would also mark the beginning of the rivalry with Army and the continuation of rivalry with Michigan State.[20][21] In an effort to gain respect for a regionally successful but small-time Midwestern football program, Harper scheduled games in his first season with national powerhouses Texas, Penn State, and Army.[22] That year, Notre Dame burst into the national consciousness and helped to transform the collegiate game in a single contest. On November 1, 1913, the Notre Dame squad stunned the Black Knights of the Hudson 35‚Äì13 in a game played at West Point.[23] Led by quarterback Gus Dorais and end Knute Rockne, the Notre Dame team attacked the Cadets with an offense that featured both the expected powerful running game but also long and accurate downfield forward passes from Dorais to Rockne. This game has been miscredited as the invention of the forward pass.[24] Prior to this contest, receivers would come to a full stop and wait on the ball to come to them, but in this contest, Dorais threw to Rockne in stride, changing the forward pass from a seldom-used play into the dominant ball-moving strategy that it is today.[24][23] Irish assistant Knute Rockne became head coach in 1918.[25] During his 13 years, the Irish won three national championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925,[26] and produced players such as George Gipp and the \"Four Horsemen\".[27] Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran a 7‚Äì2‚Äì2 scheme.[28][29] Rockne took over in the war-torn season of 1918[30] He made his coaching debut on September 28, 1918, against Case Tech in Cleveland, Ohio, and earned a 26‚Äì6 victory.[31] Leonard Bahan, George Gipp, and Curly Lambeau were in the backfield.[32][33] With Gipp, Rockne had an ideal handler of the forward pass.[34][35] The Irish posted a 3‚Äì1‚Äì2 record for the season, losing only to the Michigan Agricultural Aggies. The 1919 team had Rockne handle the line and Gus Dorais handle the backfield.[36] The Irish went undefeated and were one of four teams to be selected for the national championship, although Notre Dame does not claim it.[37][38] Gipp died at age 25 on December 14, 1920,[39] just two weeks after Walter Camp elected him as Notre Dame's first All-American.[40][39] Gipp likely contracted strep throat and pneumonia while giving punting lessons after his final game on November 20 against Northwestern.[40] Since antibiotics were not available in the 1920s, treatment options for such infections were limited and they could be fatal even to young, healthy individuals.[41] Rockne was speaking to Gipp on his hospital bed when he was purported to have delivered the famous \"Win one for the Gipper\" line.[42][39][43][44][45] John Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10‚Äì1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns.[46] Grantland Rice wrote that \"Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space\" and noted that the 1921 Notre Dame team \"was the first team we know of to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game.\"[47] Mohardt had both Eddie Anderson and Roger Kiley at end to receive his passes.[48][49] The national champion 1924 team included the \"Four Horsemen\" backfield of Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden.[50][51] The line was known as the \"Seven Mules\".[52] The Irish capped an undefeated, 10‚Äì0 season with a victory over Stanford in the Rose Bowl.[26] The 1926 team beat Army and was led by Christie Flanagan,[53][54] but was undone by a loss to Carnegie Tech in the penultimate game of the season. In this game, Rockne made what an Associated Press writer called \"one of the greatest coaching blunders in history\" by traveling to Chicago for the Army‚ÄìNavy Game to \"write newspaper articles about it, as well as select an All-America football team.\" Carnegie Tech used the coach's absence as motivation for a 19‚Äì0 win; the upset likely cost the Irish a chance for a national title.[55] The 1928 team lost to national champion Georgia Tech.[56] \"I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man‚ÄìPeter Pund,\" said Rockne. \"Nobody could stop him. I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined.\"[57] Among the events that occurred during Rockne's tenure none may be more famous than the Rockne's \"Win one for the Gipper\" speech.[58] Army came into the 1928 matchup undefeated and was the clear favorite.[59] Notre Dame, on the other hand, was having their worst season under Rockne's leadership and entered the game with a 4‚Äì2 record.[59] At the end of the half Army was leading and looked to be in command of the game. Rockne entered the locker room and gave his account of Gipp's final words: \"I've got to go, Rock. It's all right. I'm not afraid. Some time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are going wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with all they've got and win just one for the Gipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Rock. But I'll know about it, and I'll be happy.\"[60] The speech inspired the team and they went on to upset Army and win the game 12‚Äì6.[61] The 1929 and 1930 teams both went undefeated,[62][63] winning national championships,[64][65] and the 1930 team was led by the likes of Frank Carideo, Joe Savoldi, Marchy Schwartz and Marty Brill.[65] It featured the first and only example of all four members of a backfield being named to an All-American team during the same season. The 1929 team played all of its games on the road while the new Notre Dame Stadium was being built.[66] In 1930, \"Jumping Joe\" Savoldi scored the first Notre Dame touchdown in the new stadium on a 98-yard kickoff return.[67] Savoldi is also known as \"the first hero in the lore of Notre Dame's Stadium\" based on scoring three touchdowns in the official stadium dedication game against Navy the following week.[68] Rockne coached his last game on December 14, 1930, when he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New York City.[69][70] The game raised funds for the Mayor's Relief Committee for the unemployed and needy of the city.[71] 50,000 fans turned out to see the reunited \"Four Horsemen\" along with players from Rockne's other championship teams take the field against the pros.[72] On March 31, 1931, Rockne died at age 43 in the crash of a Transcontinental & Western Air airliner in Kansas; he was on his way to help in the production of the film The Spirit of Notre Dame.[73][74][75] The crash site is located in a remote expanse of Kansas known as the Flint Hills and now features a Rockne Memorial.[76] As Notre Dame's head coach from 1918 to 1930, Rockne posted what has remained for decades the all-time highest winning percentage (.881) for a football coach in the NCAA's flagship FBS division.[77][78] During his 13-year tenure as head coach of the Fighting Irish, Rockne collected 105 victories, 12 losses, 5 ties and 3 national championships.[79][80] Rockne also coached Notre Dame to 5 undefeated and untied seasons.[79][80] Through game broadcasts during the Golden Age of Radio, Notre Dame football gained a nationwide following of \"subway alumni\", Catholics who became fans whether or not they attended the university.[81] Former Saint Louis head coach Heartley \"Hunk\" Anderson was promoted from assistant coach and took the helm of the Irish after Knute Rockne's death, leading them to a record of 16 wins, nine losses, and two ties.[82] Anderson was a former Irish player under Rockne and was serving as an assistant coach at the time of Rockne's death. Notre Dame finished 6‚Äì2‚Äì1 in 1931.[83] The Irish lost a heartbreaker by a score of 16‚Äì14 to USC on November 21 that snapped the program's 26-game unbeaten streak.[84] 1933 was a tough year for the Irish as they finished with a 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 record, the first losing season for the program since 1888. ND suffered a four-game losing streak, failing to score a point in all four losses to Carnegie Tech, Pittsburgh, Navy, and Purdue.[85] Anderson resigned as Irish head coach after the 1933 season to accept the position of head football coach at NC State.[86] Anderson was replaced by Elmer Layden, who was one of Rockne's \"Four Horsemen\" in the 1920s. After graduating, Layden played professional football for one year and then began a coaching career.[87] Layden's 1935 squad posted one of the greatest wins in school history by rallying to defeat Ohio State by a score of 18‚Äì13 in a game billed as the \"Game of the Century\".[88][89] His 1938 team finished 8‚Äì1, losing only to USC in the season finale.[90] This loss cost them a possible consensus national championship, but the team was named national champion by the Dickinson System.[91] Like Rockne before him, Layden was a goodwill ambassador for Notre Dame during his time as head coach.[92][93] He was able to schedule a home-and-home series with Michigan after meeting with Fielding H. Yost, healing a rift between the two schools.[94] The two teams had not met since 1909, when, after eight straight losses to the Wolverines, the Irish posted their first win.[95][96] They were scheduled to meet again in 1910, but Michigan canceled the game and refused to play the Irish again.[96] By the time they met again in 1943, Layden had left Notre Dame and Frank Leahy had taken his place.[96] The Irish posted a record of 47 wins, 13 losses, and three ties in seven years under Layden,[97] the most successful record of a Notre Dame coach not to win a national championship.[98] He left Notre Dame after the 1940 season to become Commissioner of the National Football League.[98][87] Boston College head coach Frank Leahy was hired by Notre Dame to take over for Layden in 1941 and was another former Irish player who played during the Rockne era. After graduating from Notre Dame, Leahy held several coaching positions, including line coach of the Seven Blocks of Granite of Fordham University that helped that team win all but two of their games between 1935 and 1937.[99] He then coached the Boston College Eagles to a win in the 1941 Sugar Bowl and a share of the national championship.[100][101] His move to Notre Dame began a new period of gridiron success for the Irish and ensured Leahy's place among the winningest coaches in the history of college football.[102] Leahy coached the team for 11 seasons from 1941 to 1943 and 1946 to 1953.[99] After finishing in the AP top 10 each of his first two seasons, Leahy's 1943 team went 9‚Äì1 and captured Notre Dame's fourth national championship (and first since the advent of the AP Poll). Quarterback Angelo Bertelli became Notre Dame's first Heisman Trophy winner. From 1944 to 1945, Leahy served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was honorably discharged as a captain.[103] Edward McKeever, Leahy's assistant coach, became interim head coach when Leahy left for the Navy.[104] During 1944, his one year at the helm, the Irish managed 8 wins and 2 losses.[105] McKeever left Notre Dame in 1945 to take over as head coach of Cornell.[106] For the 1945 season, he was replaced by Hugh Devore, who led the Irish to a 7‚Äì2‚Äì1 record.[107] Upon Leahy's return in 1946 and due to his status as a veteran himself, the Irish heavily recruited returning veterans who were often much older than incoming freshmen. Largely thanks to this influx of talent, Notre Dame went four consecutive seasons after World War II without losing a game, winning the 1946, 1947, and 1949 national championships in the process.[108] The 1946 game against Army, ending in a 0‚Äì0 tie, pitted two of the greatest teams of all time against each other and included three consecutive Heisman Trophy winners (Army's Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis and Notre Dame's Johnny Lujack, who quarterbacked the 1946 and 1947 Irish). The 1948 team missed out on a national championship due only to a 14‚Äì14 tie at USC in the final game of the season. In 1949, Notre Dame went unbeaten and untied for the second time in three seasons behind Heisman Trophy-winning end Leon Hart, who would later be selected first overall in the 1950 NFL Draft. A fifth national championship was lost because of a 1953 tie against Iowa, in a game that featured 1953 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lattner[109] that caused a minor scandal at the time, when it appeared that some Irish players had faked injuries to stop the clock, leading some to nickname those players the \"Fainting Irish\".[110][111][112] Leahy retired in 1954 reportedly due to health issues.[113] Perhaps the best example of this occurred during the Georgia Tech game in 1953. Leahy fell ill during the game, which led to him collapsing during halftime.[114][self-published source] The situation was so dire that a priest was called in to give Leahy Catholic last rites.[115] However, Leahy recovered, and the consequent diagnosis was that he was suffering from nervous tension and pancreatitis.[116] Leahy has the second highest winning percentage (.864) of any college coach in history. He led the Irish to a record of 87 wins, 11 losses, and nine ties including 39 consecutive games without a loss (37‚Äì0‚Äì2), four national championships, and six undefeated seasons.[102][117] The departure of Frank Leahy ushered in a downward slope in Notre Dame's performance.[118] 25-year old assistant coach Terry Brennan was hired as Frank Leahy's successor as the Notre Dame head coach in 1954 and would stay until 1958. Brennan was a former player under Leahy. Before joining the Irish, he had coached the Mount Carmel High School team in Chicago.[119] His first two seasons the Irish were ranked fourth and ninth respectively in the AP poll, with a loss to Purdue the only blemish on the 1954 team's schedule.[119][120] It was the 1956 season that began to darken Brennan's reputation, for it became one of the most dismal in the team's history and saw them finish the season with a mere two wins, including losses to Michigan State, Oklahoma, and Iowa.[121] One bright spot in the 1956 season was the awarding of the Heisman Trophy to Paul Hornung, who would go on to a legendary NFL career with the Green Bay Packers. Hornung is the only Heisman winner to win the award while playing for a team that had a losing record.[122] The Irish would recover the following season, posting a record of 7‚Äì3[123] and including in their wins a stunning upset of Oklahoma, in Norman, Oklahoma, that ended the Sooners' still-standing record of 47 consecutive wins.[124] In Brennan's final season, though, the Irish finished 6‚Äì4,[125] leading to Brennan's firing in mid-December.[126] Brennan's tenure can only be properly framed with the understanding that in a time of zero scholarship limitations in college football, Notre Dame's administration inexplicably began a process of de-emphasizing football, severely cutting scholarships and hindering Brennan from building a roster of any meaningful depth.[127] He departed with a total of 32 wins and 18 losses.[128] Former San Francisco, Chicago Cardinals and Washington Redskins head coach Joe Kuharich took the head coaching position at Notre Dame in 1959, realizing a longtime ambition to return to his alma mater.[129][130] He had earlier been courted by Notre Dame after the 1956 season, after the Irish finished 2‚Äì8, but before he had a chance to accept an offer, Terry Brennan was given a reprieve.[131] Kuharich brought a professional touch to Irish football, putting shamrocks on the players' helmets and shoulder stripes on their jerseys.[131][132] However, his tenure became one of the worst stretches in program history, including a school-record eight-game losing streak in 1960, a year in which the Irish finished 2‚Äì8.[133] The consensus opinion was that Kuharich never made the adjustment from pro football to college football, attempting to use complicated pro coaching techniques with collegiate players, and never adapted to the limited substitution rules in effect at the time, having big, immobile linemen playing both ways in an era where smaller, quicker players were preferred. He often said, \"You win some and you lose some\", and seemed perfectly content finishing 5‚Äì5 every year. This did not sit well with the Irish faithful, who expected Notre Dame to beat everybody.[134] When the pressure of winning became too much to bear, Kuharich resigned in the spring of 1963 and assumed the post of supervisor of NFL officials.[131] Because it was so late in the spring, the freshman team's coach Hugh Devore was named head coach for the 1963 season while the search for a permanent replacement was being conducted.[135] Kuharich compiled a 17‚Äì23 record over four non-winning seasons and remains to this day the only coach ever to have an overall losing record at Notre Dame. Despite his unsuccessful tenure, Kuharich remains the only Irish coach to post back-to-back shutouts over their greatest rival, the USC Trojans, in 1960 (17‚Äì0) and 1961 (30‚Äì0).[136] In 1964, Ara Parseghian left his job as the Northwestern head football coach when he was hired to take over the coaching duties at Notre Dame.[137] He immediately brought the team back to a level of success in Irish football history that was comparable only to Rockne and Leahy. These three coaches have an 80% or greater winning percentage while at Notre Dame ‚Äì Rockne at .881, Leahy at .864, and Parseghian at .836. Parseghian's teams never won fewer than seven nor lost more than three games during the ten-game regular seasons of the era.[138] In his first year, the Irish improved their record to 9‚Äì1 behind Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback John Huarte, but they lost any hope for a national championship in the last game of the season at USC when Craig Fertig connected with a touchdown pass to Rod Sherman.[139] Parseghian earned coach of the year honors from the American Football Coaches Association, the Football Writers Association, and The Sporting News, as well as several others, and a cover story in Time magazine.[140][141] The 1966 team did finish unbeaten, finishing #1 in the AP Poll and winning the national championship in the process. The Irish had six shutout wins, each by 30 or more points. This includes a season-ending 51-0 win at #10 USC, the largest margin of victory by either side in the rivalry's history. This season is most remembered for a 10‚Äì10 tie at #2 Michigan State in the \"Game of the Century\" in which the injury-plagued Irish played for a tie rather than risking a loss.[142] It was under Parseghian as well that Notre Dame lifted its 40-plus year-old \"no bowl games\" policy,[143] beginning with the season of 1969, after which the Irish played the #1 Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl Classic, losing in the final minutes in a closely contested game.[144] The following year, Parseghian's 9‚Äì1 squad[145] ended Texas' Southwest Conference record 30-game winning streak in the Cotton Bowl.[144] In 1971, Cliff Brown became the first African-American quarterback to start a game for the program.[146] The Irish returned to glory by winning Parseghian's second national championship in 1973, sweeping through their regular-season schedule 10‚Äì0 and defeating #1 Alabama 24-23 in the Sugar Bowl by taking advantage of a fourth-quarter missed extra point by the Crimson Tide. Due to health issues, Parseghian was forced to retire from coaching after another bowl win over Alabama to conclude the 1974 season.[147] During Parseghian's eleven-year career, the Irish amassed a record of 95‚Äì17‚Äì4 and captured two national championships. The Irish finished in the AP Top 10 nine times and never ranked lower than #14 at the end of a season. Parseghian was also named coach of the year by several selectors in his national championship years of 1966 and 1973 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980.[148][149] Dan Devine was hired to take over as head coach upon Parseghian's retirement from Notre Dame in 1975.[150] Devine was already a highly successful coach and had led Arizona State, Missouri, and the NFL's Green Bay Packers.[150] Devine had been a leading candidate for the head coaching job at Notre Dame in 1964, when Ara Parseghian was hired.[151] When approached for the job following Parseghian's resignation, Devine accepted immediately, joking that it was probably the shortest job interview in history.[152] When he arrived at Notre Dame he already had a college coaching record of 120 wins, 40 losses, and eight ties and had led his teams to victory in four bowl games.[153] At Notre Dame he would lead the Irish to 53 wins, 16 losses, and a tie as well as three bowl victories.[153] His lasting achievement came midway through this run, when the 1977 Notre Dame team won the national championship, led by junior quarterback Joe Montana.[154] Before the game against USC, played at home on October 22, Devine changed the team's jerseys from navy blue & white to kelly green & gold, later known as the \"green jersey game\", resulting in a 49‚Äì19 victory over the Trojans.[155] The Irish continued to wear green for the rest of Devine's tenure at the school.[155] The championship season climaxed with a 38‚Äì10 win in the 1978 Cotton Bowl Classic over previously top-ranked Texas, led by Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell.[156] The win vaulted the Irish from fifth to first in the polls. The following season, the Irish lost their first two games including a shocking 3‚Äì0 loss to Missouri in South Bend, but would recover to finish the regular season 8‚Äì3 and earn a berth in the Cotton Bowl against Houston. The Irish used three Montana touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) to recover from a 22-point deficit in the fourth quarter and win 35‚Äì34, the largest fourth-quarter comeback in college football history at the time. The game became known as the \"Chicken Soup Game\" after Montana ate a bowl of chicken soup at halftime while battling the flu.[157] The 1979 and 1980 Irish did not live up to the standards set by earlier Devine teams, although the former season did see Vagas Ferguson set the single-season program rushing record (1,437 yards) that still stands today. Because he had the unenviable task of following a legend, Devine came under heavy scrutiny while at Notre Dame and it was felt that he was never fully embraced by the Notre Dame community, despite winning a national championship.[158] After a 5‚Äì2 start in his first season, rumors of incompetence were circulated and that Devine would be dismissed and replaced by Don Shula or even Ara Parseghian (who went so far as to say he would not return to Notre Dame under any circumstances).[159] Even on the day of the 1977 USC game, \"Dump Devine\" bumper stickers were being sold outside Notre Dame Stadium.[159] On August 15, 1980, Devine announced that he would be leaving Notre Dame at the end of season, saying he wanted to be able to spend more time with his wife.[158] Gerry Faust was a surprise choice when hired to replace Devine in 1981.[160] Prior to Notre Dame, Faust had been one of the more successful high school football coaches in the country. As coach of Moeller High School in Cincinnati he amassed a 174‚Äì17‚Äì2 record over 19 seasons.[161] Many of his players had gone on to play for Notre Dame; indeed, when he arrived in South Bend, he was reunited with nine of his former players from Moeller. Despite his success in the high school ranks, Faust's success at Notre Dame was mixed. In his first season, the Irish finished 5‚Äì6.[162] In Faust's second season, Notre Dame improved slightly to 6‚Äì4‚Äì1.[163] The most successful years under Faust were the 1983 and 1984 campaigns where the Irish finished 7‚Äì5 and made trips to the Liberty Bowl and Aloha Bowl respectively.[164][165] His final record at Notre Dame was 30‚Äì26‚Äì1.[166] To avoid being fired, Faust resigned at the end of the 1985 season.[167][168] He announced his resignation prior to the final game of the year, where Notre Dame suffered a humiliating 58‚Äì7 loss at Miami; Allen Pinkett scored the Irish TD. Faust proceeded to take over as head coach at Akron.[169] Lou Holtz had 17 years of head coaching experience by the time he was hired to lead the Irish.[170] He had previously been head coach of William & Mary, North Carolina State, the NFL's New York Jets, Arkansas, and Minnesota.[170] In contrast to Faust, Holtz was well known as a master motivator and a strict disciplinarian.[171][172] The tone was set with Holtz's first meeting with his team as Irish head coach in 1986, immediately demanding his players sit up straight in their chairs and look him in the eye as he spoke.[173] Holtz began in 1986 where his predecessor left off in 1985, finishing with an identical record of 5‚Äì6.[174] However, unlike the 1985 squad, which was generally outcoached and outplayed, Holtz's 1986 edition was competitive in nearly every game, losing five out of those six games by a combined total of 14 points. That would be his only losing season as he posted a record of 95‚Äì24‚Äì2 over the next ten seasons adding up to a 100‚Äì30‚Äì2 record overall.[175][176] In 1987, Holtz led the Irish to an 8‚Äì4 record.[177] Notre Dame's best player was star wide receiver Tim Brown, who would win the Heisman Trophy that season and is Notre Dame's seventh and most recent Heisman winner.[178][179] The 1988 campaign began with high hopes, as former Notre Dame coaches Rockne, Leahy, Parseghian, and Devine all won their first national championship in their third season with the program. The Irish defeated their first five opponents, ascending to the #4 ranking in the lead-up to a visit from the reigning national champion Miami Hurricanes. In a game which became known as Catholics vs. Convicts due to a popular T-shirt design on Notre Dame's campus, the Irish upset the Hurricanes 31‚Äì30 when Pat Terrell knocked down Steve Walsh's two-point conversion attempt with no time on the clock. When star players Ricky Watters and Tony Brooks showed up late for dinner right before the then top-ranked Irish played second-ranked USC in the final regular season game of 1988,[180] in a controversial move, Holtz took his 10‚Äì0 Irish squad to Los Angeles without them.[181] His move was vindicated when the Irish defeated USC anyway.[182] Holtz was named national coach of the year,[170] and a win over No. 3 West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl captured the Irish's 11th-all time national championship.[183] 1988 remains Notre Dame's most recent undefeated season and national championship.[184][185] In 1989, Holtz led the Irish to a 12‚Äì1 record. The Irish began the season in the Kickoff Classic game in East Rutherford, New Jersey, against Virginia.[186] The Irish won by a score of 36‚Äì13 and ascended to the #1 spot in the AP Poll.[187] Next, top-ranked Notre Dame defeated #2 Michigan by a score of 24‚Äì19.[188] After nine more consecutive victories to begin the season 11‚Äì0, the Irish would lose to #7 Miami in the final week of the season, ending Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak.[189] Holtz would lead the Irish to a victory in the Orange Bowl over #1 Colorado to end the season, finishing #2 in the AP poll behind Miami.[190] After beginning the 1990 season with a #1 ranking and a victory over #4 Michigan by a score of 28‚Äì24 and two more wins for a 3‚Äì0 start, the Irish took their first loss of the season, losing to Stanford by a score of 36‚Äì31. The Irish would ascend back to #1 on the strength of a home win over #2 Miami, a game that saw the end of the series between the two until 2010.[191] However, late-season losses to Penn State and Colorado in the Orange Bowl would eliminate the Irish from national championship contention.[192] The 1991 Fighting Irish began the season 8-1, but lost back-to-back games for the first time since 1987 when they again lost to Penn State. The Irish would receive a berth in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, where they defeated Florida by a score of 39‚Äì28.[193][194] In 1992, Notre Dame finished 10‚Äì1‚Äì1. After defeating Northwestern to start the season,[195] the Fighting Irish tied #5 Michigan, their first tie of the Holtz era.[196] This season saw the Irish's largest win in history against Purdue, a 48‚Äì0 win at Notre Dame Stadium, and a 28‚Äì3 Cotton Bowl against previously unbeaten #4 Texas A&M.[197][198] The Irish enjoyed another successful season in 1993, finishing the season at 11‚Äì1. After scoring 27 points in wins over Northwestern and #2 Michigan to start the season, the Irish defeated their next six opponents to enter a matchup with undefeated #1 Florida State 8‚Äì0 and ranked just behind the Seminoles at #2. For the first time, ESPN's College GameDay decided to make a visit to campus to host the show live on Saturday morning.[199] In a classic, the Irish defeated the Seminoles 31‚Äì24, ascending to the #1 ranking a day later. However, a loss to #17 Boston College on a game-winning field goal as time expired by a score of 41‚Äì39 ended the Irish's national championship aspirations.[200] The Irish would face a rematch with #6 Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl to finish the season, a game the Irish won by a score of 24‚Äì21.[201][202] Controversially, Notre Dame finished #2 in the AP poll behind a team in Florida State it had beaten. In 1994, Holtz led Notre Dame to a 6‚Äì5‚Äì1 record, the Irish's worst record since Holtz's first season in 1986.[203] The team lost three of four games midseason to drop out of the rankings for the first time since 1986. The Irish would improve to 9‚Äì3 in 1995, but lost to #8 Florida State in the Orange Bowl.[204][205] Lou Holtz's final season at Notre Dame in 1996 resulted in an 8‚Äì3 record. The season notably saw Notre Dame's first participation in the Emerald Isle Classic in Ireland, a 54‚Äì27 win over Navy, and an overtime loss to USC, snapping the Irish's 13-game non-losing streak against the Trojans.[206][207] Holtz's option offense, which helped catapult Notre Dame to many victories in the late 1980s and early 1990s, also helped rack up impressive recruiting classes. During the 1989 season, Holtz had the following future NFL players on offense: QB Rick Mirer, RB Ricky Watters, RB Anthony Johnson, RB Rodney Culver RB Dorsey Levens, and WR Raghib Ismail. In 1990, he added RB Jeff Burris (who would later move to safety), FB Jerome Bettis and TE Irv Smith. 1991 saw the additions of RB Reggie Brooks and FB Ray Zellars. 1992 saw the addition of WR Derrick Mayes. For 1993, he added FB Marc Edwards. In 1995, he added RB Autry Denson. From the 1987‚Äì1995 NFL Drafts, there were a total of 65 Notre Dame players selected.[208] Overall, Holtz took Notre Dame to one undefeated season, nine consecutive New Year's Day bowl games, and top 10 finishes in the AP poll in five seasons,[209] as well as overseeing the majority of the longest winning streak against USC in program history (11 games). Holtz retired from Notre Dame following the 1996 season,[210] but would unretire in 1999 to accept the head coaching position at South Carolina where he would serve until the completion of the 2004 season.[211][212] Bob Davie, who had been Holtz's defensive coordinator from 1994 to 1996, was promoted to head coach when Holtz retired.[213] Davie, who turned down a head coaching offer from Purdue to accept the Irish's head coaching position,[214] was a well-respected defensive mind who had also served as defensive coordinator at Tulane and Texas A&M.[215] Davie had also filled in as head coach for one game during the 1995 season when Lou Holtz was dealing with a health issue.[216] One of his first major decisions was to fire long-time offensive line coach Joe Moore, who then successfully sued the university for age discrimination.[217] On Davie's watch, the team suffered three bowl game losses (1997 Independence Bowl,[218] 1999 Gator Bowl,[219] and 2001 Fiesta Bowl),[220] and it failed to qualify for a bowl game in two others (1999 and 2001). The highlight of Davie's tenure was a 36‚Äì20 upset win in 1998 over #5 Michigan, the defending national champions.[221][222] On December 17, 1999, Notre Dame was placed on probation by the NCAA. The association's Committee on Infractions found two series of violations. The New York Times reported \"the main one involved the actions of a booster, Kimberly Dunbar, who lavished gifts on football players with money she later pleaded guilty to embezzling.\" In the second series of events, a football player was accused of trying to sell several complimentary game tickets and of using others as repayment of a loan. The player was also said \"to have been romantically involved with a woman (not Dunbar), a part-time tutor at the university, who wrote a term paper for another player for a small fee and provided players with meals, lodging and gifts.\"[223] The Dunbar violation began while Lou Holtz was head coach: \"According to the NCAA committee report, Dunbar, the woman at the center of the more serious violations, had become romantically involved with several Notre Dame football players from June 1995 to January 1998 and had a child with one, Jarvis Edison.\"[223] Notre Dame was placed on probation for two years and lost one of its 85 football scholarships each year in what the Times termed \"minor\" penalties.[223][224] Davie nearly defeated top-ranked Nebraska in 2000, with the Irish comeback bid falling short in overtime 27‚Äì24.[225] The aforementioned 2001 Fiesta Bowl was Notre Dame's first invitation to the Bowl Championship Series. The Irish lost by 32 points to Oregon State,[226] but would finish No. 15 in the AP Poll, Davie's highest ranking as head coach. Despite Davie's rocky tenure, new athletic director Kevin White gave the coach a contract extension following the 2000 season,[227] then saw the team start 0‚Äì3 in 2001 ‚Äì the first such start in school history.[228] Disappointed by the on-field results, coupled with the Joe Moore and Kim Dunbar scandals, the administration decided to dismiss Davie after the 2001 season.[229] His final record at Notre Dame was 35‚Äì25.[230] On December 9, 2001, Notre Dame hired George O'Leary, the head coach at Georgia Tech, to replace Davie.[231] However, while researching a story on O'Leary, New Hampshire Union Leader reporter Jim Fennell uncovered misrepresentations in O'Leary's resume that had influenced the administration's decision to hire him.[232] The resulting media scandal embarrassed Notre Dame officials and tainted O'Leary; he resigned five days later, before coaching a single practice, recruiting a single player, or hiring a single assistant coach.[233] O'Leary's tenure is the shortest of any head coach in FBS history.[234] O'Leary would go on to become the head football coach at the University of Central Florida.[235] Once again in need of a new head coach, the school turned to Tyrone Willingham, the head coach at Stanford.[236] Willingham's hiring made him the first African American head coach in Notre Dame football history.[237] Bringing a feeling of change and excitement to campus, Willingham led the 2002 squad to a 10‚Äì2 regular season record, including an 8‚Äì0 start with wins over #7 Michigan and #11 Florida State, and a #4 ranking. This great early start, however, would be the lone highlight of Willingham's tenure, as Notre Dame finished the year with a loss to Boston College, then lopsided losses to USC and North Carolina State in the Gator Bowl.[238] The program faltered over the next two seasons under Willingham, compiling an 11‚Äì12 record.[239] During this time, Notre Dame lost a game by at least 30 points on five occasions. Furthermore, Willingham's 2004 recruiting class was judged by analysts to be the worst at Notre Dame in more than two decades.[240] Citing Notre Dame's third consecutive four-touchdown loss to arch-rival USC[241] compounded by another year of subpar recruiting efforts, the Willingham era ended on November 30, 2004 (after the conclusion of the 2004 season) when the university chose to terminate him and pay out the remainder of Willingham's six-year contract.[242] After Willingham's firing, Notre Dame initially pursued Utah head coach Urban Meyer, who had been an Irish assistant from 1996 to 2000 and had a clause in his Utah contract that stated he could take the Notre Dame head coaching job without paying a buyout.[243][244] After Meyer accepted the Florida head coaching position and turned down the Irish,[245] Charlie Weis left the NFL's New England Patriots, where he won three Super Bowls as offensive coordinator,[246] to become head football coach for the Irish beginning with the 2005 season.[247] A first-time head coach when he was hired by Notre Dame,[248] Weis was officially introduced on December 12, 2004.[249] Weis' hiring as the Irish's 30th head football coach made him the first Notre Dame graduate to hold the football head coaching position on a full-fledged basis since Joe Kuharich.[250] Weis signed a six-year contract worth about $2 million annually excluding incentives.[251][252][253] To kick off his inaugural season, Weis led the Irish to back-to-back road wins over ranked teams, the first time that had been done by a Notre Dame coach since Knute Rockne. On September 25, Weis and the Irish traveled to Seattle to face Washington and former head coach Tyrone Willingham, who was hired by the Huskies to be their head coach two weeks after getting fired at Notre Dame.[254] The Irish won by a score of 36‚Äì17.[255] Entering the rivalry game with USC, defending national champions and owners of a 27-game winning streak, the Irish had risen to #9 in the AP Poll. In one of the most famous games in the rivalry's history, USC defeated Notre Dame 34‚Äì31. The game is most remembered for Trojan running back and eventual Heisman winner Reggie Bush, who had already scored three touchdowns that day, illegally pushing quarterback Matt Leinart into the end zone on the final play of the game, in a play now known as the \"Bush Push\". The Irish won their remaining five games to earn an appearance in the Fiesta Bowl. There, they were defeated by the Ohio State Buckeyes 34‚Äì20[256] to finish the season 9‚Äì3 and #9 in the AP poll, their highest final ranking since 1993. Quarterback Brady Quinn broke numerous team passing records that season and became a top Heisman Trophy contender.[257] Wide receiver Jeff Samardzija was the team's leading receiver and also broke Notre Dame's single-season records for receiving yards and touchdowns.[258] During the 2005 season, Notre Dame signed Weis to a big raise and ten-year contract extension that was set to keep the coach in South Bend through the 2015 season.[259][260] Weis and the Irish went into the 2006 season with a No. 2 preseason ranking in the ESPN/Coaches Poll.[261] They finished the regular season with a 10‚Äì2 record, losing only to Michigan and USC. Notre Dame accepted a bid to the 2007 Sugar Bowl, losing to LSU 41‚Äì14. This marked their ninth consecutive postseason loss, the longest drought in NCAA history.[262] As a result, Notre Dame dropped to #17 in the final rankings.[263][264] In the wake of a graduating class that sent eleven players to the NFL,[265] the 2007 season included various negative milestones: the most losses in a single year (9);[266] two of the ten worst losses in program history (38‚Äì0 losses to both Michigan[267] and USC);[268] and the first 6-game losing streak for home games.[269] The Naval Academy recorded their first win over the Irish since 1963, breaking Notre Dame's NCAA-record 43-game win streak.[270] In 2008, the Irish started 4‚Äì1, but completed the regular season with a 6‚Äì6 record,[271] including a 24‚Äì23 home loss to Syracuse, the first time that Notre Dame had fallen to an eight-loss team.[272] Quarterback Jimmy Clausen was the team's star player, completing over 60% of his passes.[273][274] Despite speculation the university might fire Weis, it was announced he would remain head coach.[275] Weis's Notre Dame squad ended the season breaking the Irish's NCAA bowl losing streak by beating Hawaii, 49‚Äì21, in the Hawaii Bowl.[276] Weis entered the 2009 season with the expectation from the Notre Dame administration that his team would be in position to compete for a BCS Bowl berth.[277] Notre Dame started the first part of the season 4‚Äì2, with close losses to Michigan and USC. Sitting at 6‚Äì2, however, Notre Dame lost to Navy for the second time in three years,[278] which became the first loss in a four-game losing streak to finish the season. Quarterback Jimmy Clausen and wide receiver Golden Tate would forgo their senior seasons and enter the NFL Draft.[279] Weis was fired on November 30, 2009.[280] According to Weis' buyout, he was to be paid $6 million then $2.05 million annually until the contract ran out in December 2015 for a total of about $19 million.[281] During that time, Weis made more money annually not to coach the Irish than his successor, Brian Kelly, made to coach the team.[282] On December 10, 2009, Cincinnati head coach Brian Kelly became the 31st head coach of the Fighting Irish after leading the Bearcats to a 12‚Äì0 record and BCS bowl-game berth, but he left the team before the bowl game.[283][284] Kelly's hiring surprised very few as he was a northern Irish Catholic who was considered one of college football's rising stars.[285] In his first season, Kelly led the Fighting Irish to an 8‚Äì5 record.[286] Tragedy struck early in the season when Declan Sullivan, a junior working for the athletic department, died while filming a practice on a scissor lift in dangerously high winds.[287] Dayne Crist started the season at quarterback but was injured for a second consecutive year, this time in the Tulsa game, which the Irish lost.[288] Kelly turned to freshman quarterback Tommy Rees, who led the Irish to victories in the last three games against #15 Utah, Army in Yankee Stadium, and breaking an eight-year losing streak to USC in the LA Coliseum. Kelly guided the Irish to a 33‚Äì17 win over Miami (FL) in the 2010 Sun Bowl to finish 2010 with an 8‚Äì5 record.[289] With senior wideout Michael Floyd returning for his senior season and an outstanding recruiting class that included several highly touted defensive linemen,[290] Kelly and the Irish looked to improve on their 8‚Äì5 record from the prior year. However, an early season upset to a Skip Holtz-led South Florida team and a last-second loss to Michigan in Ann Arbor, games in which the Irish committed 10 total turnovers, left the Irish at 0‚Äì2 to start the season. The Irish bounced back to beat #15 Michigan State and had two 4-game winning streaks, with the only loss during that stretch coming at the hands of USC.[291] The Irish also broke Navy's 2-game winning streak over Notre Dame. Notre Dame lost 18‚Äì14 to Florida State in the 2011 Champs Sports Bowl, concluding the 2011 campaign with an 8‚Äì5 record overall, identical to the 2010 season.[292] In the team's losses, multiple turnovers from the quarterback position were often the culprit, and as a whole turnovers at critical times in the game often derailed potential Irish comebacks. On September 12, 2012, during the football program's 125th season, Notre Dame announced that it would leave the Big East Conference for the Atlantic Coast Conference, excluding the football and hockey programs.[293] This move became official on July 1, 2013. While the Fighting Irish football team remained an FBS independent, it agreed to play five games per season against ACC teams starting with the 2014 football season. In return, Notre Dame became eligible to participate in the ACC's sub-BCS level bowl arrangements.[294] The 2012 season was another entry in historic third seasons for Notre Dame head coaches. The Irish began the season 7‚Äì0, including wins over ranked rivals in Michigan State, Michigan, and Stanford. The game against the Cardinal required a goal-line stand against running back Stepfan Taylor in overtime to preserve the win for the Irish.[295] The season's signature win came at #8 Oklahoma with ESPN's College GameDay in town. On November 18, after a loss by #1 Oregon, Notre Dame became ranked #1 in the nation in both the AP and Coaches' polls after reaching 11‚Äì0 during the regular season for the first time since 1993, also ranking #1 in the BCS standings for the first time in the 14-year history of the selection system.[296] After defeating USC on November 24,[297] Notre Dame concluded its first 12‚Äì0 regular season, and the Irish were soon formally named to appear in the BCS National Championship Game for the first time. In that game, on January 7, 2013, the Irish lost to Alabama 42‚Äì14.[298] The strength of the 2012 Fighting Irish was its defense, captained by senior leader Manti Te'o, who broke the school record for interceptions by a linebacker with 7 and finished second to Johnny Manziel in Heisman Trophy voting. Coming off the previous year's national title game appearance, the Fighting Irish were dealt a blow when 2012 starting quarterback, Everett Golson, was suspended from the University due to an academic violation.[299] Senior Tommy Rees then took over. Notre Dame's 2013 season ended with a record of 9‚Äì4,[300] a victory over Rutgers in the Pinstripe Bowl, and a #20 AP poll ranking.[301][302] The 2014 season started off with 6 straight victories and a #5 national ranking heading into a showdown with #2 Florida State in Tallahassee, Florida. FSU won that game 31‚Äì27, on a controversial offensive pass interference call that brought back a last-second Notre Dame touchdown. The Fighting Irish bounced back with a win against Navy before dropping their final 4 games of the season. They did win the Music City Bowl by defeating the LSU Tigers and finished the season at an 8‚Äì5 record.[303] The 2015 Fighting Irish began its season with another new offensive coordinator, Mike Sanford Jr.[304] Led for most of the year by sophomore quarterback DeShone Kizer, the Irish had fourteen plays of over 50 yards during the season, which was a school record, including two touchdowns of over 90 yards (a 91-yard touchdown run by C. J. Prosise and a 98-yard touchdown run by Josh Adams). The Irish only had two in the previous 126 years of Notre Dame football. They finished the regular season averaging 34 points per game, including a 62-point effort against UMass, the most points in a game since 1996. The Irish began the season 10‚Äì1 and were in position for a College Football Playoff appearance, but lost a last-second game to Stanford to finish with a 10‚Äì2 record and a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.[305] Star linebacker Jaylon Smith was injured early in the game which became a loss to Ohio State.[306] The 2016 season ended with a 4‚Äì8 record, Brian Kelly's worst win‚Äìloss record at Notre Dame. The tone for the season was set early, with a heartbreaking double overtime loss to Texas in the season opener.[307] Just 4 games into the season, Brian Kelly fired defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder.[308] At the end of the season, starting quarterback DeShone Kizer declared for the NFL Draft[309] and backup quarterback Malik Zaire announced he would be transferring in the winter after graduation.[310][311] Amidst speculation that Kelly's job was in jeopardy and that Kelly was looking to leave Notre Dame, athletics director Jack Swarbrick announced that Kelly would return for the 2017 season.[312] The 2017 season was one of Kelly's strongest seasons at ND. An early one-point loss to #2 Georgia was the only blemish on an 8-1 start, keyed by a 49-14 blowout over rival USC. The tough running of running back Josh Adams behind an experienced and talented offensive line, which included future top-10 picks Quenton Nelson and Mike McGlinchey and won the Joe Moore Award as the best offensive line in that nation, allowed Notre Dame to string together 6 consecutive 20+ point victories. However, when #3 Notre Dame visited #7 Miami in South Florida on November 7, an embarrassing 41-8 loss effectively ended the Irish hopes of a playoff run. They ended the season with a win over LSU in the Music City Bowl.[313] The Irish opened the 2018 season at home against Michigan and won, 24‚Äì17.[314] After benching quarterback Brandon Wimbush in favor of Ian Book, the Irish then won the remainder of their regular season games, including victories over #7 Stanford, #24 Virginia Tech, #12 Syracuse, and Northwestern.[315] This led to Notre Dame's first undefeated regular season since 2012.[316] They were ranked #3 in the nation by the College Football Playoff committee and selected to play in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Cotton Bowl against Clemson.[317] Notre Dame's undefeated streak came to an end after losing to the eventual national champions 30‚Äì3 to finish the season at 12‚Äì1.[318] Kelly was named AP Coach of the Year and Home Depot Coach of the Year for the 2018 season.[319][320] Kelly and the Fighting Irish started off the 2019 season with a #9 ranking in the AP Poll. Notre Dame won their first two games before dropping a 23‚Äì17 result to #3 Georgia. Notre Dame won their next three games before dropping a 45‚Äì14 game to #19 Michigan. Notre Dame closed out the regular season with victories in their last five games, followed by a win in the Camping World Bowl 33‚Äì9 over Iowa State.[321] In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancellation of regular season scheduled games, Notre Dame joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in football for a single season in 2020 and played a full slate of conference matches.[322] The Irish won all ten of their games, including a mid-season contest against perennial conference power and top-ranked Clemson. The Fighting Irish defeated the Tigers 47‚Äì40 in double overtime. However, Clemson defeated the Irish in a rematch in the ACC Championship Game 34‚Äì10. Notre Dame qualified for the College Football Playoff as the #4 seed.[323] In the College Football Playoff Semifinals against Alabama at the Rose Bowl, Notre Dame lost 31‚Äì14 to finish with a 10‚Äì2 record.[324] In what would become Kelly's final season as head coach in 2021, the Fighting Irish were ranked #9 to begin the season, but struggled in their first two games, beating Florida State 41‚Äì38 and Toledo 32‚Äì29. Following a 24‚Äì13 loss to #7 Cincinnati, Kelly helped lead the Fighting Irish to a seven-game winning streak to finish the regular season 11‚Äì1 and earn a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.[325] On November 29, 2021, Kelly resigned as Notre Dame head coach to accept a ten-year, $95 million contract offer to become head coach at LSU.[326] In so doing, Kelly became the first Irish head coach since Thomas A. Barry in 1907 to leave Notre Dame for another coaching job.[327] Kelly left the Irish as the program's all-time winningest head coach.[328][329] On December 3, 2021, Notre Dame's defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman was promoted to the head coaching position to replace Brian Kelly, becoming the 32nd head coach in program history.[330][331] The second African American head coach in the history of the Irish football program, Freeman signed a five-year contract worth $4 million annually excluding incentives.[332][333][334] Freeman took control immediately, coaching the Irish in their Fiesta Bowl loss to Oklahoma State.[335][336] Freeman opened the 2022 season with losses to Ohio State (his alma mater) and Marshall, thus becoming first head coach in Notre Dame history to start his tenure with three losses.[337] He gained his first win the following week against the California.[338][339] Freeman's Irish would go on to finish the regular season ranked 19th with a record of 8-4, including an upset win over No. 5 Clemson.[340][341] They were awarded a berth in the Gator Bowl where they defeated South Carolina 45‚Äì38.[342][343] For the 2023 season, Freeman guided the Notre Dame program to a 10-win season. Safety Xavier Watts received the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for college football's best defensive player and the team earned victories over #17 Duke, #10 USC and #19 Oregon State in the Sun Bowl. Notre Dame finished the year ranked #14 in the final AP Top 25. Freeman and the Fighting Irish held their first home game of the 2024 season against the Northern Illinois Huskies as the #5 ranked team in the AP Top 25 and as a 28.5-point favorite to win. They fell to the Huskies 16-14, throwing two interceptions and giving up two blocked field goals. It was the second early-season home loss for the Irish against a heavy underdog in three years (following the 2022 loss to Marshall), was the first-ever win by a Mid-American Conference football program against a top 5 team, the first-ever Huskie win against a top 10 team, and one of the largest point-spread upsets in modern college football.[344] The Irish went on to complete the regular season 11-1 and will host a home game in the first year of the expanded college football playoffs. Notre Dame's 11 claimed national championships are: Following its appearance in the 1925 Rose Bowl, Notre Dame did not play in a post-season game for 44 consecutive years (1925‚Äì1968), including after many of the team's most successful seasons from the Rockne era in the 1920s and the Leahy era in the 1940s. The university's stated reasons for its self-imposed hiatus were that bowl games were \"glorified exhibitions\" that played no part in national championship selections and that they extended the season too far to the detriment of players' academic progress.[351] Notre Dame has made 874 appearances in the Associated Press poll over 71 seasons. Notre Dame has spent 591 weeks in the Top 10, 318 weeks in the Top 5, and 98 weeks at No. 1.[352] Notre Dame has finished the year ranked in the final Associated Press poll of the season 56 times: Notre Dame has participated in eleven \"No. 1 vs No. 2\" matchups since the AP poll began in 1936.[369] They have a record of 5‚Äì3‚Äì2 in such games, with a 4‚Äì1‚Äì1 record as the No. 1 team in such matchups. Here's a list of such games: Notre Dame has played in many regular season games that have been widely regarded by both the media[370] and sports historians[371] as historic or famous games. Notre Dame has played in many games labeled \"Game of the Century\" as well as several No. 1 vs No. 2 matchups.[372] Notre Dame has also played in several bowl games considered by many sportswriters to be among the best bowl games played:[384][385] Notre Dame's all-time record after the 2023 season stands at 948 wins, 338 losses, and 42 ties. ‚Ä† George O'Leary did not coach a single practice or game, resigning five days after being hired for misrepresenting his academic credentials.‚Ä° Kent Baer served as interim head coach for one game at the 2004 Insight Bowl after Tyrone Willingham was fired. Notre Dame has made 41 bowl game appearances, winning 20 and losing 21, with one game vacated.[387] After an initial appearance in a postseason contest in the 1925 Rose Bowl, the Fighting Irish refused to participate in bowl games for more than four decades;[388] Sports Illustrated's Dan Jenkins speculated that Notre Dame might have gone to as many as twenty bowl games during the self-imposed forty-five-year hiatus.[388] From 1994 to the 2006 football seasons, Notre Dame lost 9 consecutive bowl games, tied with Northwestern for the most in NCAA history. That streak ended with a 49‚Äì21 win over Hawaii in the 2008 Hawaii Bowl. In the process, Notre Dame scored its highest point total in postseason play. The record of 9 consecutive bowl losses was later tied by Northwestern in 2011, then that streak was snapped a year later. Currently, the Fighting Irish are in a skid with winless 0-8 record in BCS/Playoff games and 0-10 in their last 10 major bowl games. Notre Dame's last major bowl win came against Texas A&M in the 1994 Cotton Bowl. Between 2009 and 2016, and resuming again in 2018, Notre Dame has hosted an annual off-site home football game known as the Shamrock Series. The series promotes Notre Dame's athletic and academic brand, and has brought the Fighting Irish to San Antonio, New York, Greater Washington, D.C., Chicago, Indianapolis, Boston and the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex. Notre Dame has yet to lose a game in the Shamrock Series with a record of 11-0 (including the later-vacated win over Arizona State in the 2013 season). Prior to the 2012 season, Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick announced at a news conference of plans to continue the series through 2016. He confirmed after his news conference that New York is expected to fall in that rotation and then continue to be the one consistently repeating venue for Shamrock Series games. The Shamrock Series was not held in 2017, but resumed in 2018. One of the unique aspects of the Shamrock Series is its inclusion of academic and other non-football activities in the area of that year's host city the days and hours leading up to the game, which include pep rallies, drummers' circles, and academic lectures.[389][390][391] The Shamrock Series held in Las Vegas was the largest crowd for a college athletic event in Nevada history.[392] Seven Notre Dame football players have won the Heisman Trophy, which ties them with the University of Oklahoma for the second most by any university. (Ohio State also has seven trophies that were won by only six players, while USC has the most winners with eight). Heisman voting:[394] 50 former Notre Dame players and 6 coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, located in Atlanta, Georgia.[364] Notre Dame leads all universities in players inducted. Notre Dame's home jersey is navy blue with white numerals, gold outlining, and a small interlocking \"ND\" logo on each sleeve. The away jersey is white with navy numerals, gold outlining, and the interlocking \"ND\" on the sleeves. These uniforms were introduced by Lou Holtz in 1986 and retained during the tenures of Bob Davie (1997-2001) and Tyrone Willingham (2002‚Äì04). In 2005, Charlie Weis removed the interlocking \"ND\" from the sleeves, replacing it with the player's number, the first time the Irish had worn \"TV numbers\" since 1986, when they were located on the shoulders. These jerseys remained throughout Weis' tenure. When Brian Kelly succeeded Weis in 2010, the interlocking \"ND\" returned to the sleeves, and it has remained since. The Irish traditionally have not worn player names on their jerseys during regular season games, but they were included during the coaching tenures of Dan Devine (1975‚Äì80) and Gerry Faust (1981-85). When Notre Dame appeared in the 1970 Cotton Bowl Classic, its first bowl game in 45 years, Ara Parseghian had player names placed on the backs of the jerseys, a tradition which was retained for four other bowl appearances under Parseghian. Holtz, Davie, Willingham and Weis (in the 2006 Fiesta Bowl and 2007 Sugar Bowl) did not adhere to this tradition for bowl games they coached, but it returned under Weis for the 2008 Hawaii Bowl and has been continued by Kelly and Marcus Freeman. Notre Dame's helmets are solid gold with gray facemasks, the gold being emblematic of the University's famed \"Golden Dome\". Notre Dame's tradition for the team's student managers to spray-paint the team's helmets prior to each game ended in 2011 when the football equipment staff, along with Notre Dame Athletics Director Jack Swarbrick and head coach Brian Kelly outsourced the painting process to Hydro Graphics Inc. During Gerry Faust's tenure (1981‚Äì85), Notre Dame's blue jerseys switched from the traditional navy (although Notre Dame wore green jerseys full-time between the 1977 game vs. USC and the end of the 1980 season) to royal blue with gold and white stripes on the sleeves (they also wore a green jersey with sleeve stripes for the 1983 game vs. USC). The navy blue jerseys returned for the 1984 season (the Irish wore a redesigned white jersey during the 1983 Liberty Bowl without sleeve stripes and navy blue names and numbers which was carried over to 1984). No uniform numbers have been retired by Notre Dame. Upon being issued a number, each player is given a card that lists some of the more famous players who have worn that particular number. Number 3 is perhaps the most famous number in Irish football history, having been worn by Ralph Guglielmi, George Izo, Daryle Lamonica, Coley O'Brien, Joe Montana, Michael Floyd, Rick Mirer and Ron Powlus, among others.[425] Number 5 is also notable, as it is the only number to be worn by one of the Four Horsemen (Elmer Layden) a Heisman Trophy Winner (Paul Hornung) and a National Title winning Quarterback (Terry Hanratty).[425] Number 7 has been worn by such Irish greats as 1964 Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte, 1970 Heisman runner-up Joe Theismann, Steve Beuerlein, Jimmy Clausen and Jarious Jackson.[425] In 2011, both Michigan and Notre Dame wore throwback uniforms in their game against each other. For each Shamrock Series game, Notre Dame wears specially-designed helmets, jerseys, and pants. Champion supplied football jerseys for Notre Dame for over 50 years until the Irish switched to Adidas in 2001. On July 1, 2014, the Notre Dame athletic department began wearing uniforms and footwear supplied by Under Armour. Over the years, Notre Dame has occasionally worn green instead of blue as its home jersey, sometimes adopting the jersey for an entire season ‚Äì or more ‚Äì at a time. Notre Dame is confirmed to have worn green as far back as 1926 against Penn State, and in 1942 they officially became an alternate color for the team.[426] Currently, Notre Dame reserves its green jerseys for special occasions. Sometimes on such occasions, the Irish will take the field for warmups dressed in blue, only to switch to green when they go back to the locker room before kickoff. This tradition was started by Dan Devine in 1977 before the USC game. Notre Dame has also been known to switch jerseys at halftime, as during the 1985 USC game and in the loss to Nile Kinnick-led Iowa in 1939, although this was to help avoid confusion between their navy uniforms and Iowa's black ones. The current design of the jersey is kelly green with gold numbers and white outlining. For the 2006 Army game, Coach Charlie Weis broke out the green jerseys as a reward to his senior players and in an attempt to end the string of losses by the Irish when wearing green. Notre Dame wore throwback green jerseys in 2007 against USC in honor of the 30th anniversary of the 1977 National Championship team but lost the game 38-0.[427] As of 2023, Notre Dame's record in green is 42-15-1, going back to 1975.[426] On at least one occasion (1992 Sugar Bowl) Notre Dame has worn an away variant of the jersey, a white jersey with green numbers. Notre Dame Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Located on the southeast part of the university's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana and with a seating capacity of 77,622, Notre Dame Stadium is one of the most renowned venues in college football.[428] The Sporting News ranks Notre Dame Stadium as #2 on its list of \"College Football Cathedrals\".[429] and the stadium experience evokes a more traditional feel. Notre Dame Stadium is used for football-related activities and for Commencement (since 2010). Notre Dame Stadium had no permanent lighting until the expansion project in 1997. NBC paid for the lighting as they have televised all Notre Dame home football games since 1991. On April 12, 2014, it was announced during the annual Blue-Gold Spring Game that a FieldTurf synthetic surface would replace the grass field after the 2014 Commencement Weekend. In November 2014 the University of Notre Dame embarked on a $400 million stadium expansion called the Crossroads Campus Project, which was completed in time for the 2017 season. Cartier Field was the original playing field of the Fighting Irish. In 1930, it was replaced by Notre Dame Stadium, due to the growing popularity of ND football. Known by fans as \"The Gug\" (pronounced \"goog\"), The Guglielmino Athletics Complex is Notre Dame's football headquarters. The Gug houses the offices for all team staff members, an auditorium, a weight room, a training room, the equipment room, the practice locker room, a brand new napping room, and various other spaces for the football team to utilize. The complex was underwritten by Don F. Guglielmino and his family. The indoor practice facility has a synthetic turf field and a video board at midfield for replay and graphics. On the second level of the facility, there is a 1,600-square-foot recruiting lounge. In all, the facility totals 111,400 square feet, and the ceiling is 95 feet at its peak. Notre Dame has rivalries with several universities. Although the Fighting Irish competes as an Independent, they play a national schedule that includes annual or otherwise regularly scheduled rivalry games. Army, Boston College, Michigan, Michigan State, Navy, Northwestern, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Stanford, and USC are among Notre Dame's rivals. Notre Dame and the Miami Hurricanes first met during the 1955 college football season.[430] They met three times during the 1960s (1960, 1965, and 1967) and proceeded to play each other annually from 1971 to 1990 (except in 1986). Notre Dame consistently dominated the series in the 1970s, but in the 1980s, Miami began to dominate as the once docile rivalry intensified significantly. Both teams were national contenders in the later part of the decade, and both teams cost each other at least one national championship. Hostilities were fueled when the Hurricanes routed the Fighting Irish in the 1985 season finale 58‚Äì7, with Miami widely accused of running up the score in the second half. The rivalry gained national attention and both teams played their most famous games from 1988 to 1990. The game known as Catholics vs. Convicts in South Bend was won by the Fighting Irish 31‚Äì30. The following year, Miami ended Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak with a 27‚Äì10 victory. The rivalry ended after the Fighting Irish dashed #2 Miami's hopes for a repeat national championship with a 29‚Äì20 victory in South Bend. Notre Dame dropped Miami from its schedule due to the intensified rivalry. The two teams are next scheduled to meet during a yet to specified date during the 2025 season. They also will play each other in yet to be scheduled dates in the 2031, 2032, 2034, and 2037 seasons.[431] The first meeting between Notre Dame and Michigan was in 1887, the first official football game in Notre Dame's history.[432] The two schools have met 44 times in total, the latest matchup in 2019. Through the 2021 season, the two schools are both in the top five in all-time Division I winning percentage, with Notre Dame fourth and Michigan third Meeting for the first time in 1897, Notre Dame and Michigan State play for the Megaphone Trophy. The two schools played in 64 out of 70 seasons from 1948 to 2017, but have not met since. Their next scheduled game is in 2026.[433] Notable games in the series include the 1966 \"Game of the Century\". Through the 2023 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 48‚Äì28‚Äì1 and the trophy series 33‚Äì27‚Äì1.[434] Navy and Notre Dame played 93 games without interruption from 1927 to 2019. Notre Dame had a 43-game win streak during this time frame, the longest streak by one team over another in Division I-A football, which ended in 2007.[435] While the 2020 contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the series resumed in 2021. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the series 83‚Äì13‚Äì1.[436] USC is Notre Dame's primary rival, and the schools compete annually for the Jeweled Shillelagh. The rivalry has produced 39 national championships,[437]: 113‚Äì118 15 Heisman Trophy winners,[438] and 184 Consensus All-Americans through the 2021 season.[439] It is considered one of the most prominent rivalries in college football,[440][441][442][443] and has been called the greatest rivalry not dictated by conference affiliation or geography.[444] The teams have played each other annually since 1926, except from 1943 to 1945 and 2020. Notable games in the series include the 1977 \"Green Jersey\" game and the 2005 \"Bush Push\" game. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 50‚Äì37‚Äì5 and the trophy series 35‚Äì30‚Äì3.[445] Due to its long and storied history, Notre Dame football boasts many traditions unique to Notre Dame. Some of these are: Since the NFL began drafting players in 1936, 495 Notre Dame football players have been selected by NFL teams. Additionally, Notre Dame has had 65 players selected in the first round of the NFL draft, including five overall number one picks. Of the 46 Super Bowls competed, as of 2012, only 14 teams have won the event without an Irish player on the roster.[457] Looking at both participating team rosters, there have only been five Super Bowls that did not feature at least one former Notre Dame player on either team's roster ‚Äì Denver vs. Atlanta, 1999; Dallas vs. Buffalo, 1994; Washington vs. Denver, 1988; Dallas vs. Denver, 1978; and Baltimore vs. Dallas, 1971.[457] Eleven former players have won multiple Super Bowls: Mark Bavaro, Rocky Bleier, Nick Buoniconti, Eric Dorsey, Dave Duerson, David Givens, Terry Hanratty, Bob Kuechenberg, Joe Montana, Steve Sylvester and Justin Tuck.[457] 13 former Notre Dame players, plus 1 non-player alumnus, have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, tying it for first with USC among all college football programs.[458][459] *McNally graduated from St. John's (MN), but started his career at Notre Dame and is listed as a hall of famer under both schools in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[460] The Fighting Irish are the only team, professional or collegiate, to have all their games broadcast nationally on the radio and their home games on television.[462] Notre Dame famously left the College Football Association, a consortium that administered television broadcast rights on behalf of over 64 schools, in 1990, in order to establish its own broadcasting deal with NBC. From 1968 to 2007, Westwood One served as the official radio partner for the Irish, broadcasting their games for 40 consecutive years.[463] Until the 2006 Air Force game, Notre Dame had a record 169 consecutive games broadcast nationally on either NBC, ABC, ESPN, or CBS.[464] The 2006 ND vs. Air Force game was broadcast on CSTV, a college sports channel owned by CBS who had an exclusive contract with the Mountain West Conference, of which Air Force is a member. Radio rights to the Fighting Irish are held by Skyview Networks, who began distributing the broadcasts as part of a multi-sport arrangement in 2020.[465] NBC has been televising Notre Dame Home football games since the 1991 season.[9] In addition to TV broadcasts, NBC also maintains several dedicated websites to ND football and Notre Dame Central,[466] which provides complete coverage, full game replays and commentary of the Notre Dame team. NBC's television contract with Notre Dame was renewed in April 2013 and was set to continue through the 2025 football season,[467] before another contract renewal was made in 2023. NBC is now set to be the home of Notre Dame football through the 2029 season. It also aired football games on NBC's streaming service Peacock started in the 2021 season, with the home opener on September 11, 2021, against Toledo aired exclusively on the streaming service.[468][469] Internationally Sky Sports has been covering Notre Dame Football home games in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Germany since 2018 as a result of Comcast's takeover of Sky Although the Notre Dame football program is not a full member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), it has an agreement to play an average of five ACC schools per season. In return Notre Dame has access to the non-College Football Playoff ACC bowl line-up.[470][471] Notre Dame utilizes a format of six home games in South Bend, five away games, and one major metropolitan area neutral site \"Shamrock Series\" home game for scheduling.[389] This includes preserving traditional yearly rivalries with USC, Stanford, and Navy,[472] five rotating ACC opponents (two away ACC games will coincide in even years with away games at Navy and three away ACC games will coincide in odd years with home games against Navy),[473] two home and home series (one home game and one away game), one one-time opponent home game, and the traveling \"Shamrock Series\" home game.[474][475] TBA: 1 additional ACC away game will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC home game and 1 additional non-ACC home game will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 3 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled.

                "content": "The science and astronomy behind the shortest day of the year The winter solstice is the day of the year with the fewest hours of daylight. In the northern hemisphere this date falls in December every year. In 2024 the winter solstice will occur on Saturday 21 December. Learn more about the astronomy behind the solstice with Royal Observatory Greenwich. Sign up to our space newsletter for monthly astronomy guides, special events and exclusive news from Royal Observatory Greenwich. The apparent position of the Sun in the sky changes throughout the year. During the summer months it rises higher in the sky and is above the horizon for longer. In the winter the Sun's position is lower and its time in the sky is shorter. This variation happens because the Earth orbits at an angle: it is tilted 23.4 degrees on its axis. During summer in the northern hemisphere the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun, and therefore this part of the Earth receives more direct sunlight and longer daylight hours. During winter in the northern hemisphere the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun, resulting in fewer daylight hours. This animation shows how the tilt of the Earth's axis influences the seasons. For more great astronomy explainers and resources, check out the Royal Observatory's schools pages. The winter solstice occurs at the point when this tilt away is at its maximum and the Sun is lowest in the sky. This is what gives us the shortest day and the longest night of the year. If you're in the southern hemisphere the opposite is true: in December the South Pole is tilted towards the Sun, making it summertime 'Down Under'. This image, a composite of dozens of photographs taken by Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2021 entrant Gy√∂rgy Soponyai, shows the changing arcs of the Sun throughout the year. The smallest arc at the bottom marks the winter solstice, and the largest one at the top the summer solstice. The band in the middle is the 'equinox', with roughly equal hours of day and night. The actual moment of the solstice in 2024 will occur at 9.21am GMT in the UK, but most people concentrate on the whole solstice day, which has been recognised by holidays and festivals in many cultures around the world. The shortest day lasts 7 hours 49 minutes and 42 seconds in London. This means that the length of the day during the winter solstice is 8 hours, 49 minutes shorter than the summer solstice. After the shortest day, the days start getting longer and the nights shorter. At the spring and autumnal equinoxes the day and night hours are around the same length, each lasting around 12 hours. The number of daylight hours peaks at summer solstice. The world 'solstice' comes from the Latin 'solstitium', meaning 'Sun stands still' ‚Äì because the apparent movement of the Sun's path north or south stops before changing direction. It depends. If you're talking about 'astronomical winter' then yes, the solstice is the first day of winter. However, if you're referring to 'meteorological winter' then the first day of winter is 1 December. This is because meteorologists (scientists who study weather and climate patterns) split the year evenly, with three months for each of the four seasons. Whichever definition you use, it might not 'feel' like winter straight away. The coldest temperatures during the day are generally felt some time after the shortest day has passed. Winter solstice is an important time for cultures across the globe. Under the old Julian Calendar, the winter solstice occurred on 25 December. With the introduction of the Gregorian calendar the solstice slipped to the 21st, but the Christian celebration of Jesus‚Äôs birth continued to be held on 25 December. Here are some of the festivals celebrated internationally, past and present: The pre-Christian festival, the Feast of Juul, was observed in Scandinavia at the time of the December solstice. Fires would be lit to symbolise the heat and light of the returning Sun and a Yule log was gathered and burnt in the hearth as a tribute to the Norse god Thor. Present-day Christmas customs and traditions such as the Yule log, Yule boar, Yule singing, and others stem from pagan Juul. Today the event is celebrated in some forms of Modern Paganism. In Ancient Rome, the festival of Saturnalia began on 17 December and lasted for seven days. As the name suggests, the festival was celebrated in honour of Saturn, the father of the gods ‚Äì the same deity after which the sixth planet in our solar system is named. People would make sacrifices at the Temple of Saturn before banqueting and giving gifts. The usual law and order would be suspended, schools and businesses would close, and quarrels would be forgotten. In China and East Asia, the Dongzhi Festival is one of the most important times of the year. It celebrates the return of longer daylight hours and ultimately an increase of positive energy. The festival‚Äôs origins can be traced back to the yin and yang philosophy of balance and harmony. During this time for getting together, families in southern China often make and eat tangyuan: balls of glutinous rice, occasionally brightly coloured, cooked in a sweet or savoury broth. Shab-e Yalda ‚ÄòYalda night‚Äô or Shab-e Chelleh ‚Äònight of forty‚Äô is an Iranian festival celebrated on the ‚Äòlongest and darkest night of the year‚Äô. Friends and family get together to eat, drink and read poetry until the early hours. Pomegranates and watermelons are particularly significant. Today, people from the UK and beyond visit the ancient site of Stonehenge to celebrate the winter and summer solstices. One reason why this is a popular site to visit is that it's possible to glimpse the Sun‚Äôs rays through the stones, which are positioned to align with the path of the Sun. Most people arrive late on the night of the solstice to catch the sunrise.",

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Amanda Cappelli Updated on: December 21, 2024 / 9:19 AM EST / CBS News The 2024 winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, happens on Saturday, Dec. 21, in the Northern Hemisphere. The celestial event signifies the first day of winter, astronomically. The winter solstice is the day each year that has the shortest period of daylight between sunrise and sunset, and therefore the longest night. It happens when the sun is directly above the Tropic of Capricorn, a line of latitude that circles the globe south of the equator, the National Weather Service explains. The farther north you are, the shorter the day will be, and in the Arctic Circle, the sun won't rise at all. The winter solstice occurs because of the Earth's tilt as it rotates around the sun. When the Northern Hemisphere tilts away from the sun, the nights last longer. The longest night happens on the solstice because the hemisphere is in its furthest position from the sun. That occurs each year on Dec. 21 or 22. This year, it falls on Dec. 21 at 4:21 a.m ET, to be precise. On the summer solstice, when the northern tilt is closest to the sun, we have the longest day, usually June 20 or 21. The solstices are not always exactly on the 21st every year because the earth's rotation around the sun is 365.25 days, instead of 365 even. Yes. Each day after the solstice, we get one minute more of sunlight. It doesn't sound like much, but after just two months, or around 60 days, we'll be seeing about an hour more of sunlight. The meteorological winter ends on March 20, 2025. Then, spring will last until June 20, when the summer solstice arrives. Nations and cultures around the world have celebrated the solstice since ancient times with varying rituals and traditions. The influence of those solstice traditions can still be seen in our celebrations of holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah, Britannica notes. The ancient Roman Saturnalia festival celebrated the end of the planting season and has close ties with modern-day Christmas. It honored Saturn, the god of harvest and farming. The multiple-day affair had lots of food, games and celebrations. Presents were given to children and the poor, and slaves were allowed to stop working. Gatherings are held every year at Stonehenge, a monumental circle of massive stones in England that dates back about 5,000 years. The origins of Stonehenge are shrouded in mystery, but it was built to align with the sun on solstice days. The Hopi, a Native American tribe in the northern Arizona area, celebrate the winter solstice with dancing, purification and sometimes gift-giving. A sacred ritual known as the Soyal Ceremony marks the annual milestone. In Peru, people honor the return of the sun god on the winter solstice. The ancient tradition would be to hold sacrificial ceremonies, but today, people hold mock sacrifices to celebrate. Because Peru is in the Southern Hemisphere, their winter solstice happens in June, when the Northern Hemisphere is marking its summer solstice. Scandinavia celebrates St. Lucia's Day, a festival of lights. The \"arrival of winter,\" or Dong Zhi, is a Chinese festival where family gathers to celebrate the year so far. Traditional foods include tang yuan, sweet rice balls with a black sesame filling. It's believed to have its origins in post-harvest celebrations. Researchers stationed in in Antarctica even have their own traditions, which may include an icy plunge into the polar waters. They celebrate \"midwinter\" with festive meals, movies and sometimes homemade gifts. Amanda Cappelli is a digital producer at CBS News & Stations. ¬© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

                "content": "Order 2025 Farmers' Almanac! Home ¬ª Holidays & Events The winter solstice, which marks the first day of winter 2024, occurs on Saturday, December 21, 2024 at 4:21 a.m. EST. (for the Northern Hemisphere). Learn what causes this change in seasons and winter solstice traditions from around the world. Winter solstice is the astronomical moment when the Sun reaches the Tropic of Capricorn, we have our shortest day and longest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere in terms of daylight. Regardless of what the weather is doing outside your window, the solstice marks the official start of winter. Curious what kind of weather to expect on the first day of winter 2024 and beyond? See the Farmers‚Äô Almanac winter forecast The term ‚Äúsolstice‚Äù comes from the Latin words sol (Sun) and sistere (to stand still) because, during the solstice, the angle between the Sun‚Äôs rays and the plane of the Earth‚Äôs equator (called declination) appears to stand still. So what does that mean, exactly? Upon the winter solstice, the Sun appears at its lowest in the sky, and its noontime elevation seems to stay the same for several days before and after this day. The Sun‚Äôs gradual decrease in the sky reverses upon the winter solstice, marking what many cultures believe to be a ‚Äúrebirth‚Äù of the Sun as the hours of daylight become longer. Essentially, daylight hours (the period of time between sunrise and sunset each day) have been growing slightly shorter each day since the summer solstice last June, which is the longest day of the year (at least in terms of light). December 21 marks the start of when days will begin to grow longer. They will continue to do so until we reach the summer solstice again in June. Then the cycle will begin anew. While we celebrate the winter solstice, those living in the Southern Hemisphere will be simultaneously marking the arrival of summer. That‚Äôs because while our half of the globe is inclined away from the Sun, their half is inclined toward it. Being tilted away from the Sun brings us shorter days and colder temperatures. Early man kept track of the days by observing the Sun as it ‚Äúmoved‚Äù across the sky and cast shadows during the day and at different times of the year. In fact, historians believe Stonehenge in England was erected to keep track of the Sun‚Äôs yearly progress. Looking for unique ways to celebrate the first day of winter 2024? Here are some traditions from around the world ‚Ä¶ The Winter Solstice has played an important role in cultures worldwide from ancient times until today. In fact, many of the customs, lore, symbols, and rituals associated with Christmas are actually associated with winter solstice celebrations of ancient Pagan cultures. Here are some examples: Welsh for ‚ÄúLight of Winter,‚Äù Alban Arthan is a universal festival, which has been (and still is) celebrated by many people and is probably the oldest seasonal festival of humankind. In Druidic traditions, the Winter Solstice is thought of as a time of death and rebirth when Nature‚Äôs powers and our own souls are renewed. It marks the moment in time when the Old Sun dies (at dusk on the 21st of December) and when the Sun of the New Year is born (at dawn on the 22nd of December), framing the longest night of the year. The birth of the New Sun is thought to revive the Earth‚Äôs aura in mystical ways, giving a new lease on life to spirits and souls of the dead. The prehistoric monument, Newgrange built in Ireland around 3200 B.C. (making it older than Stonehenge), is associated with the Alban Arthan festival. The site consists of a large circular mound with a stone passageway and interior chambers. When the Sun rises, the chamber is flooded with sunlight on the Winter Solstice. What Stonehenge is for Alban Hefin (The Druid festival for The Summer Solstice), Newgrange is for Alban Arthan. This was a festival observed in Scandinavia when fires were lit to symbolize the heat, light and life-giving properties of the returning Sun. A Yule‚Äîor Juul‚Äîlog was brought in and burned on the hearth in honor of the Scandinavian god, Thor. It was Thor‚Äôs job to bring the Sun‚Äôs warmth back to the people. The log, which was never allowed to burn entirely, was kept as both a token of good luck against misfortune and used as kindling for the following year‚Äôs log. In England, Germany, France, and other European countries, the Yule log was burned until nothing but ash remained. The ashes were then collected and spread into the fields as fertilizer every night until Twelfth Night, or worn around the neck as a charm. French peasants would place the cooled ashes from the log under their beds, believing they would protect the house against thunder and lightning. The present-day custom of lighting a Yule log at Christmas is believed to have originated with these fires associated with the Feast of Juul. In addition to the traditions from western cultures, the Dongzhi Winter Solstice Festival is celebrated as a time for the entire family to get together to celebrate the past good year. As ancient Chinese thought, the yang, or muscular, positive things will become stronger and stronger after this day, so it should be celebrated. Dumplings are usually eaten. In Ancient Rome, the Winter Solstice festival referred to as Saturnalia began on December 17 and lasted for seven days. It was held to honor Saturnus, the Roman god of agriculture and harvest, and was characterized by the suspension of discipline and reversal of the usual order. Grudges and quarrels were forgiven, wars were postponed, and people engaged in carnival-like festivities. The popularity of Saturnalia continued into the third and fourth centuries AD, and as the Roman Empire came under Christian rule, some of the festival‚Äôs customs have influenced our current celebrations surrounding Christmas and the New Year. If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, check your noontime shadow around the time of the solstice: It will be your longest noontime shadow of the year. Conversely, in June, at the time of the summer solstice, you‚Äôll see your shortest noontime shadow. This is because the Sun is at different angles. The Sun‚Äôs low arc across the sky in winter causes objects to cast longer shadows. How do you plan to the first day of winter 2024? Do you have any special winter solstice traditions? Share with your community here in the comments section below! Œî Œî It is also worth mentioning the Yalda night. In Iran, people have been celebrating the winter solstice for a thousand years and they call it Yalda. It is a beautiful tradition and celebrates the longest night and the birth of the sun at the end of the night (because the days get longer after this night). Thank you for sharing this! We find it interesting to learn about how these events are celebrated in different (but so very similar) ways across the globe. Indeed it is a Wednesday in my calendar These CLOWNS have drawn the Tropic of Cancer & Capricorn in the WRONG PLACE! 23.5 degrees is much further south, e.g. further than the southern tip of Florida and cuts through the tip of Baja California I would guess it is just a reference point (arrow) for both. It‚Äôs not the lines that are wrong. It‚Äôs the whole underlying map. It is shifted to the south. It shows the equator running through Central America and the southern tip of South America looks to be about to the South Pole. Honestly when that date was decided or the dates for the winter solstice which version of the universe where they going with geocentric or heliocentric? It‚Äôs a little vague of a question because it‚Äôs still a lot of unanswered facts Looks like the same with the equator and tropic of capricorn, all moved up. Maybe time to redo the globe ‚Äì but the idea is explained anyway. Luckily the sunshine is reftacted in the atmosphere so it is not always pitch black at the poles in the polar nights. Chinese people eat sticky rice balls, not dumplings on this day. Dumpling in the North, Sticky Rice Ball in the South. But never ‚Äúshweatty balls‚Äù (Ala SNL skit) ?‚úåÔ∏è lol EXACTLY I can‚Äôt visualize when winter solstice will be for OUR location. It says 10:59 EST. So will that an hour LATER at 11:59 AM CST. If so, we will have sunrise at 7:59 and sunset at 3:59 PM, which is kind of hard to think about. Can you clear that up for me? The Solstice is a moment in time. It happens the same time instant all over the world. It will happen when your clocks in Central Time read 09:59 AM on the day of. The time of Sunrise and Sunset will depend on your latitude and longitude. You can look that up in the Almanac. Thank you,THAT helped. It also helps to VISUALIZE the Rand McNally world globe from school in the 1960s. I loved turning the GLOBE and watch the sunlight as it was dark and light. I could turn the BASE to mimic the seasons where I lived. What I was missing was the idea that the whole earth was in a specific location in its elliptical ORBIT of the sun. I forgot to mention, I read an article that sunrise and sunset are SKEWED by the 23.5¬∞ tilt of earth and latitude. Earliest SUNSET was December 7. Day and night are EQUIDISTANT from noon only during the equinoxes spring and autumn. All of the stats are interesting as a way to understand the WHAT of the cosmos. The how and why are an even BIGGER challenge to discuss. We are endlessly ENTERTAINED. I wanted to correct previous errors, but can‚Äôt seem to find EDIT on here. Thank you, again. noice We can look forward to the days getting longer now but this Dreadful day has passed You can view a livestream at Newgrange here https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8anbIH-XfPU ? Spectacular that‚Äôs my birthday!!! I most certainly appreciate how Christmas has been explained in as an amalgamation of all cultures celebrations combined‚Ä¶similar to us Americans not having a true American language. It‚Äôs my birthday, too Just briefly on the language- Yes! Even though English was ‚Äòoriginally‚Äô a Germanic language, now, only about 29% of its entire vocabulary is Germanic; 24% is from Latin or the more recently derived Romance languages (i.e. French and Spanish); about 11% is from Greek, about 4% is from Hebrew/Aramaic/Arabic, etc. Middle Eastern tongues (i.e. Bible). The rest are words incorporated since the Age of Exploration, such as ‚Äòpapoose‚Äô, ‚Äòchocolate‚Äô, ‚Äòcandy‚Äô, ‚Äòbungalow‚Äô, ‚Äòkangaroo‚Äô, and even ‚Äòtea‚Äô! The sun reaches his home. This year binary. Symbolizing renewing the world. Good article. A great breakdown of the various pagan traditions, who celebrated them and how they celebrated them. Good Yule and Merry Solstice! I am from the Philippines. Part of Asia. Can I know when is the winter soltice for Asia? I also like to ask if performing the ritual for Winter Soltice, how long will it takes to do the ritual? Hi Virginia, the Winter solstice 2020 for the Philippines will be at 6:02 PM on Monday, December 21st. Actually it will be 11:59 pm in the Philippines. The Philippines is 13 hrs ahead of US EST.

                "content": "The 2024 Winter Solstice arrives in the northern hemisphere on December 21. It is the shortest day of the year, and a very powerful time on the Wheel of the Year. Here‚Äôs a closer look at what we‚Äôre honoring on this meaningful seasonal day & how its energy influences you on a deeper level. Winter Solstice is the moment the Sun is born again. Ever since last year‚Äôs Winter Solstice the Sun has grown: from birth, to its height at the Summer Solstice, then declined through autumn, until its light finally died on the darkest night. When, simultaneously, it is born again. And a new cycle of life for the Sun begins. At the Winter Solstice we honor the magnificent Sun: that on the darkest night it is born again ‚Äì bringing a new year of life & growth with it. What a miracle, that on this shortest day ‚Äì when it feels like we could just descend completely into darkness ‚Äì the Light returns with the birth of the Sun. For 6 months the days have been getting shorter as the darkness grew. But on the Winter Solstice, the Light returns. From here the days will continue to grow longer, brighter, warmer until the Sun is strong enough to return life to everything in nature. At the Winter Solstice we recognize this tiny new light. We commemorate the hope it brings, knowing it will continue to grow & deliver us from the cold, dark days. We celebrate the potential this tiny light holds. Anything is possible in the coming months! What new life will this tiny light grow?? With the birth of the Sun a new year begins. It‚Äôs the beginning of a new cycle of birth ‚Üí growth ‚Üí death in Nature; a whole new year of life, experiences & transformation. It‚Äôs a new chapter. Which makes this a really hopeful & exciting time. Anything is possible in the year that lies ahead. Anything can grow in your life. It‚Äôs a time of pure potential. And what a gift that we have this new beginning every year. This chance to go deep inside & emerge as a new version of ourselves. What growth & transformation will the year ahead bring?? Make sure to check out our powerful Winter Solstice candle ritual, as well as our kid-friendly activity! Blending spiritual practice & personal growth, unlock the power of the Winter Solstice with this transformative & empowering guide. With seasonal rituals, meditations, journal prompts & more dive deep into what the new year holds for you. The spiritual significance of Winter Solstice runs deep with several layers and dimensions. There‚Äôs a very special stillness about the season we are entering. Even though everything appears dead & frozen in the outside world, a new cycle is beginning; it‚Äôs a new year. You can sense there is magic brewing deep down in the dark. Just like the spark of new life that appears deep in a mother‚Äôs womb, you can sense a quiet spark occurring within. The winter solstice is the beginning of a new chapter in your life. It‚Äôs a new cycle of birth > growth > death in everything in nature. What will come to life for you this year? What will you nurture & grow? What harvests will your work yield in the coming year? Who knows?!! We can‚Äôt know. But there is so much hope & anticipation contained in the possibility of what those might be. Often, this promise of a new beginning has us feeling inspired to set goals for ourselves, and make promises about all the things we‚Äôre going to do in the new year. Changes we‚Äôre going to make. But, it‚Äôs actually important you don‚Äôt put that kind of pressure on yourself right now. This is not a time for action, this is a time for deep rest. Setting new year‚Äôs resolutions based on actions we want to take in our lives is too much pressure right now. We‚Äôre not meant to be accomplishing active goals right now, our job in winter is to rest. Winter is meant to be a deeply nourishing time in your life. It‚Äôs meant to nurture you, and restore you. It‚Äôs meant to ground you & to calm your nervous-system ‚Äì worn out from a long, hard year of life & growth & challenges. I realize most of us don‚Äôt have the luxury of just hibernating over winter (like we should.) The ability to truly rest is a privilege ‚Äì one that too many of us don‚Äôt have. Winter is asking you: can you lean into rest wherever you are able? Even if you don‚Äôt have the privilege of an abundance of restful time in your life, can you find small, simple places where you can embrace rest? Can resting receive just as much focus as your ‚Äòto do‚Äô list? Because your spirit is so tired. It‚Äôs been a long, hard year. You‚Äôve been through a lot. You‚Äôve worked hard, and you‚Äôve stretched & grown in so many ways. (Whether you can see this growth or not doesn‚Äôt matter.) Simply living on Earth through the past year ‚Ä¶ You have grown. And you are tired. It‚Äôs so important that you rest right now, to rejuvenate your weary spirit for the new year ahead. Winter is the chrysalis stage in the evolution of the butterfly. It‚Äôs the time when the caterpillar is wrapped up quietly, in the dark of her cocoon. To the outside world it doesn‚Äôt look like anything is happening. (And this is one of the most challenging things about embracing rest: to the outside world it doesn‚Äôt look like anything is happening. Our brains scream at us, telling us ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not doing anything. You‚Äôre wasting your time.‚Äù) But actually, deep in the dark, a quiet transformation is happening: the caterpillar is evolving into a magnificent butterfly. This is the same transformation your spirit, and all of nature, is undergoing this season. To the outside world life is still & quiet, there‚Äôs no movement. You don‚Äôt see anything meaningful happening. But in the darkness, hidden deep inside, a powerful transformation is occurring. You are evolving into a whole new place in your life. All the experiences & lessons learned over the past year are being integrated into your spirit & into your life. And you are evolving because of it. Your only work right now is to be like the caterpillar. You don‚Äôt have to do anything. Just wrap yourself, all snug in your cocoon, and simply rest. You need to rest, so you can dream. Right now you are dreaming up the dreams of everything that will grow in your life this year. You‚Äôre dreaming up new plans, new ideas, new ways of being that will blossom & grow, and become bountiful harvests in the year ahead. The dreams of everything to come this year are being sparked in your winter‚Äôs rest. Winter is the season when things are revealed by turning deep within yourself. Embracing the quiet & the darkness ‚Äì recognizing that you don‚Äôt need to do anything for the magic to unfold. This is the season of receiving. New information, ideas, dreams for the new year are revealing themselves by turning inward. Right now you are able to receive Divine downloads, and wisdom from deep within yourself ‚Äì if you‚Äôre able to get very still, and very quiet, and to simply open your spirit & your mind to receive them. Create a lot of opportunities for yourself to dream this season. (Consider keeping a dream journal by your bed, and recording anything that comes into your mind & heart in the coming weeks.) You may not be able to see it or feel it, but deep & profound growth is happening this season. You are receiving spiritual downloads & divine wisdom from deep within yourself. You are dreaming the dreams of everything to come this year. And you need so much rest, and ample time to dream, in order to receive them. The Winter Solstice is the shortest day, but it‚Äôs also the moment the Sun begins to grow again. The light of a brand new year is being lit, deep within the darkness. And the same thing is happening in you. The dreams you are dreaming in winter are the sparks of new life that will grow in the year ahead. A new light is being lit within you right now, a new fire is beginning to burn. It brings with it new hope ‚Äì anything is possible in the coming months. This is a time of pure potential. And this is why it is so important that you take this time of rest so seriously. Your work right now is to rest ‚Äì so you can dream up the dreams of everything to come this year.

                "content": "‚Äì in Europe (light green & dark grey)‚Äì in the European Union (light green) Germany,[e] officially the Federal Republic of Germany,[f] is a country in Central Europe. It lies between the Baltic and North Sea to the north and the Alps to the south. Its sixteen constituent states have a total population of over 82 million in an area of 357,596 km2 (138,069 sq mi), making it the most populous member state of the European Union. It borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. The nation's capital and most populous city is Berlin and its main financial centre is Frankfurt; the largest urban area is the Ruhr. Settlement in the territory of modern Germany began in the Lower Paleolithic, with various tribes inhabiting it from the Neolithic onward, chiefly the Celts. Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before AD 100. In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. Formal unification of Germany into the modern nation-state commenced on 18 August 1866 with the North German Confederation Treaty establishing the Prussia-led North German Confederation, which became the German Empire in 1871. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì1919, the Empire was replaced by the Weimar Republic. The Nazi rise to power in 1933 led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship, World War II, and the Holocaust. In 1949, after the war and a period of Allied occupation, Germany was organized into two separate polities with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany, or West Germany, and the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. Berlin continued its de jure Four Power status. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community and the European Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of the communist led-government in East Germany, German reunification saw the former East German states join the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990. Germany has been described as a great power with a strong economy; it has the largest economy in Europe by nominal GDP. As a global power in industrial, scientific and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer. As a developed country, it offers social security, a universal health care system, and tuition-free university education. Germany is a member of the United Nations, Council of Europe, NATO and OECD, and a founding member of the European Union, G7 and G20. It has the third-highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 54, of which 51 are cultural. The English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania, which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine.[12] The German term Deutschland, originally diutisciu land ('the German lands'), is derived from deutsch (cf. Dutch), descended from Old High German diutisc 'of the people' (from diot or diota 'people'), originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from Latin and its Romance descendants. This in turn descends from Proto-Germanic *√æiudiskaz 'of the people' (see also the Latinised form Theodiscus), derived from *√æeud≈ç, descended from Proto-Indo-European *tewt√©h‚ÇÇ- 'people', from which the word Teutons also originates.[13] Pre-human ancestors, the Danuvius guggenmosi, who were present in Germany over 11 million years ago, are theorized to be among the earliest ones to walk on two legs.[14] Ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.[15] The first non-modern human fossil (the Neanderthal) was discovered in the Neander Valley.[16] Similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the Swabian Jura, including 42,000-year-old flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found,[17] the 40,000-year-old Lion Man,[18] and the 41,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels.[19][20] The Nebra sky disk, created during the European Bronze Age, has been attributed to a German site.[21] The Germanic peoples are thought to have emerged from the Jastorf culture during the Nordic Bronze Age or early Iron Age.[22][23] From southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the Celtic, Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes.[24][25] Southern Germany was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, who belonged to the wider La T√®ne culture. They were later assimilated by the Germanic conquerors.[26] Under Augustus, the Roman Empire began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of Germania between the Rhine and Elbe rivers. In 9 AD, three Roman legions were defeated by Arminius in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.[27] The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering Germania and is thus considered one of the most important events in European history.[28] By 100 AD, when Tacitus wrote Germania, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of modern Germany. However, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hesse and the western Rhineland had been incorporated into Roman provinces.[29][30][31] Around 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.[32] After the invasion of the Huns in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the Frankish Kingdom and pushed east to subjugate Saxony and Bavaria. Areas of what is today eastern Germany were inhabited by Western Slavic tribes.[29] Charlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire in 800; it was divided in 843.[33] The eastern successor kingdom of East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe river in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.[33] Subsequently, the Holy Roman Empire emerged from it. The Ottonian rulers (919‚Äì1024) consolidated several major duchies.[34] In 996, Gregory V became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin Otto III, whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy under the Salian emperors (1024‚Äì1125), although the emperors lost power through the Investiture controversy.[35] Under the Hohenstaufen emperors (1138‚Äì1254), German princes encouraged German settlement to the south and east (Ostsiedlung).[36] Members of the Hanseatic League, mostly north German towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.[37] The population declined starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348‚Äì1350.[38] The Golden Bull issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors.[39] Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the democratization of knowledge.[40] In 1517, Martin Luther incited the Protestant Reformation and his translation of the Bible began the standardization of the language; the 1555 Peace of Augsburg tolerated the \"Evangelical\" faith (Lutheranism), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects (cuius regio, eius religio).[41] From the Cologne War through the Thirty Years' Wars (1618‚Äì1648), religious conflict devastated German lands and significantly reduced the population.[42][43] The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the Imperial Estates.[42] The legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1495‚Äì1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger Imperial Diet.[44] The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740. Following the War of the Austrian Succession and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Charles VI's daughter Maria Theresa ruled as empress consort when her husband, Francis I, became emperor.[45][46] From 1740, dualism between the Austrian Habsburg monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated German history. In 1772, 1793, and 1795, Prussia and Austria, along with the Russian Empire, agreed to the Partitions of Poland.[47][48] During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the Imperial Diet, most of the Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; France, Russia, Prussia, and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars.[49] Following the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna founded the German Confederation, a loose league of 39 sovereign states. The appointment of the emperor of Austria as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of Prussia's rising influence. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich.[50][51] The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity.[52] In light of revolutionary movements in Europe, intellectuals and commoners started the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, raising the German question. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.[53] King William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as the Minister President of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the war with Denmark in 1864; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation which excluded Austria. After the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its Kaiser, and Berlin became its capital.[54][55] In the Gr√ºnderzeit period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as chancellor of Germany secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war.[55] However, under Wilhelm II, Germany took an imperialistic course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries.[56] A dual alliance was created with the multinational realm of Austria-Hungary; the Triple Alliance of 1882 included Italy. Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances to protect against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.[57] At the Berlin Conference in 1884, Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa, German South West Africa, Togoland, and Kamerun.[58] Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include holdings in the Pacific and China.[59] The colonial government in South West Africa (present-day Namibia), from 1904 to 1907, carried out the annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples as punishment for an uprising;[60][61] this was the 20th century's first genocide.[61] The assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia and trigger World War I. After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed,[62] a general armistice ended the fighting. In the German Revolution (November 1918), Wilhelm II and the ruling princes abdicated their positions, and Germany was declared a federal republic. Germany's new leadership signed the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, accepting defeat by the Allies. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of Adolf Hitler.[63] Germany lost around 13% of its European territory and ceded all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the Pacific.[64] On 11 August 1919, President Friedrich Ebert signed the democratic Weimar Constitution.[65] Communists briefly seized power in Bavaria and a few larger cities, while conservative elements failed to overthrow the central government in the 1920 Kapp Putsch. The occupation of the Ruhr by Belgian and French troops and a period of hyperinflation followed. A plan to restructure Germany's war reparations and the creation of a new currency in 1924 helped stabilise the government and ushered in the Golden Twenties, an era of artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.[66][67][68] The worldwide Great Depression hit Germany in 1929, and by 1932 the unemployment rate had risen to 24%.[69] The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler became the largest party in the Reichstag after the election of July 1932, and President Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933.[70] After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights, and the first Nazi concentration camp opened.[71][72] On 23 March 1933, the Enabling Act gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power, overriding the constitution,[73] and marked the beginning of Nazi Germany. His government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations, and dramatically increased the country's rearmament.[74] A government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works, the most famous of which was the Autobahn.[75] In 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the Nuremberg Laws which targeted Jews and other minorities.[76] Germany also reacquired control of the Saarland in 1935,[77] remilitarised the Rhineland in 1936, annexed Austria in 1938, annexed the Sudetenland in 1938 with the Munich Agreement, and in violation of the agreement occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939.[78] Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) saw the burning of synagogues, the destruction of Jewish businesses, and mass arrests of Jewish people.[79] In August 1939, Hitler's government negotiated the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence.[80] On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, beginning World War II in Europe;[81] Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.[82] In the spring of 1940, Germany conquered Denmark and Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, forcing the French government to sign an armistice. The British repelled German air attacks in the Battle of Britain in the same year. In 1941, German troops invaded Yugoslavia, Greece and the Soviet Union. By 1942, Germany and its allies controlled most of continental Europe and North Africa, but following the Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, the Allied reconquest of North Africa and invasion of Italy in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. In 1944, the Soviets pushed into Eastern Europe; the Western allies landed in France and entered Germany despite a final German counteroffensive. Following Hitler's suicide during the Battle of Berlin, Germany signed the surrender document on 8 May 1945, ending World War II in Europe[81][83] and Nazi Germany. Following the end of the war, surviving Nazi officials were tried for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.[84][85] In what later became known as the Holocaust, the German government persecuted minorities, including interning them in concentration and death camps across Europe. The regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews, at least 130,000 Romani, 275,000 disabled, thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, thousands of homosexuals, and hundreds of thousands of political and religious opponents.[86] Nazi policies in German-occupied countries resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2.7 million Poles,[87] 1.3 million Ukrainians, 1 million Belarusians and 3.5 million Soviet prisoners of war.[88][84] German military casualties have been estimated at 5.3 million,[89] and around 900,000 German civilians died.[90] Around 12 million ethnic Germans were expelled from across Eastern Europe, and Germany lost roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory.[91] After Nazi Germany surrendered, the Allies de jure abolished the German state and partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the Federal Republic of Germany (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik; DDR). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany.[92] East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.[93] West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a \"social market economy\". Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the American Marshall Plan.[94] Konrad Adenauer was elected the first federal chancellor of Germany in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth (Wirtschaftswunder) beginning in the early 1950s.[95] West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community.[96] On 1 January 1957, the Saarland joined West Germany.[97] East Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the Soviet Union via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact. Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (Politb√ºro) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany, supported by the Stasi, an immense secret service.[98] While East German propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.[99] The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, becoming a symbol of the Cold War.[100] Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik.[101] In 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and open its border with Austria, causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary and Austria. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East Germany as a state, the East German authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process culminating in the Two Plus Four Treaty under which Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR.[102] The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, German reunification and Die Wende (\"the turning point\").[103] United Germany was considered the enlarged continuation of West Germany so it retained its memberships in international organisations.[104] Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act (1994), Berlin again became the capital of Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries.[105] The relocation of the government was completed in 1999, and modernisation of the East German economy was scheduled to last until 2019.[106][107] Since reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union, signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007,[108] and co-founding the eurozone.[109] Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent German troops to Afghanistan as part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban.[110][111] In the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel became the first female chancellor. In 2009, the German government approved a ‚Ç¨50 billion stimulus plan.[112] Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of European integration, the energy transition (Energiewende) for a sustainable energy supply, the debt brake for balanced budgets, measures to increase the fertility rate (pronatalism), and high-tech strategies for the transition of the German economy, summarised as Industry 4.0.[113] During the 2015 European migrant crisis, the country took in over a million refugees and migrants.[114] Germany is the seventh-largest country in Europe.[4] It borders Denmark to the north, Poland and Czechia to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. German territory covers 357,596 km2 (138,069 sq mi).[6] Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the Zugspitze at 2,963 metres or 9,721 feet) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the northwest and the Baltic Sea (Ostsee) in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: in the municipality Neuendorf-Sachsenbande, Wilstermarsch at 3.54 metres or 11.6 feet below sea level[115]) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe. Significant natural resources include iron ore, coal, potash, timber, lignite, uranium, copper, natural gas, salt, and nickel.[4] Most of Germany has a temperate climate, ranging from oceanic in the north and west to continental in the east and southeast. Winters range from the cold in the Southern Alps to cool and are generally overcast with limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.[116] From February 2019 ‚Äì 2020, average monthly temperatures in Germany ranged from a low of 3.3 ¬∞C (37.9 ¬∞F) in January 2020 to a high of 19.8 ¬∞C (67.6 ¬∞F) in June 2019.[117] Average monthly precipitation ranged from 30 litres per square metre in February and April 2019 to 125 litres per square metre in February 2020.[118] Average monthly hours of sunshine ranged from 45 in November 2019 to 300 in June 2019.[119] The territory of Germany can be divided into five terrestrial ecoregions: Atlantic mixed forests, Baltic mixed forests, Central European mixed forests, Western European broadleaf forests, and Alps conifer and mixed forests.[120] As of 2016[update], 51% of Germany's land area is devoted to agriculture, while 30% is forested and 14% is covered by settlements or infrastructure.[121] Plants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. According to the National Forest Inventory, beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute just over 40% of the forests; roughly 60% are conifers, particularly spruce and pine.[122] There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include roe deer, wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver.[123] The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.[124] The 16 national parks in Germany include the Jasmund National Park, the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park, the M√ºritz National Park, the Wadden Sea National Parks, the Harz National Park, the Hainich National Park, the Black Forest National Park, the Saxon Switzerland National Park, the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park.[125] In addition, there are 17 Biosphere Reserves,[126] and 105 nature parks.[127] More than 400 zoos and animal parks operate in Germany.[128] The Berlin Zoo, which opened in 1844, is the oldest in Germany, and claims the most comprehensive collection of species in the world.[129] Germany is a federal, parliamentary, representative democratic republic. Federal legislative power is vested in the parliament consisting of the Bundestag (Federal Diet) and Bundesrat (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The Bundestag is elected through direct elections using the mixed-member proportional representation system. The members of the Bundesrat represent and are appointed by the governments of the sixteen federated states.[4] The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law, are valid in perpetuity.[130] The president, currently Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is the head of state and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the Bundesversammlung (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates.[4] The second-highest official in the German order of precedence is the Bundestagspr√§sident (President of the Bundestag), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.[131] The third-highest official and the head of government is the chancellor, who is appointed by the Bundespr√§sident after being elected by the party or coalition with the most seats in the Bundestag.[4] The chancellor, currently Olaf Scholz, is the head of government and exercises executive power through his Cabinet.[4] Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party and the Alliance 90/The Greens have also been junior partners in coalition governments. Since 2007, the democratic socialist party The Left has been a staple in the German Bundestag, though they have never been part of the federal government. In the 2017 German federal election, the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.[132][133] Germany is a federation and comprises sixteen constituent states which are collectively referred to as L√§nder.[134] Each state (Land) has its own constitution,[135] and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation.[134] As of 2017[update], Germany is divided into 401 districts (Kreise) at a municipal level; these consist of 294 rural districts and 107 urban districts.[136] Germany has a civil law system based on Roman law with some references to Germanic law.[140] The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review.[141] Germany's specialized supreme court system includes the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice for civil and criminal cases, along with the Federal Labour Court, Federal Social Court, Federal Fiscal Court, and Federal Administrative Court for other matters.[142] Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the Strafgesetzbuch and the B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch respectively. The German penal system seeks the rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the public.[143] With the exceptions of petty crimes, tried by a single professional judge, and of serious political crimes, all charges are adjudicated by mixed tribunals where lay judges (Sch√∂ffen) and professional judges preside together.[144][145] As of 2016, Germany's murder rate stood at a low of 1.18 murders per 100,000.[146] In 2018, the overall crime rate fell to its lowest since 1992.[147] Same-sex marriage has been legal in Germany since 2017, and LGBT rights are generally protected in the nation.[148] Germany has a network of 227 diplomatic missions abroad[149] and maintains relations with more than 190 countries.[150] Germany is a member of NATO, the OECD, the G7, the G20, the World Bank and the IMF. It has played an influential role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a strong alliance with France and all neighbouring countries since 1990. Germany promotes the creation of a more unified European political, economic and security apparatus.[151][152][153] The governments of Germany and the United States are close political allies.[154] Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a bond between the two countries resulting in Atlanticism. [155] After 1990, Germany and Russia worked together to establish a \"strategic partnership\" in which energy development became one of the most important factors. As a result of the cooperation, Germany imported most of its natural gas and crude oil from Russia.[156][157] Germany's development policy functions as a distinct sector within its foreign policy framework. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community.[158] It was the world's second-biggest aid donor in 2019 after the United States.[159] Germany's military, the Bundeswehr (Federal Defence), is organised into the Heer (Army and special forces KSK), Marine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Cyber- und Informationsraum (Cyber and Information Domain Service) branches.[160] In absolute terms, German military spending in 2023 was the seventh-highest in the world.[161] In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that German military expenditure would be increased past the NATO target of 2%, along with a one-time 2022 infusion of 100 billion euros, representing almost double the 53 billion euro military budget for 2021.[162][163] In 2023, military spending according to NATO criteria amounted to $73.1 billion, or 1.64% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%. In 2024, Germany reported $97.7 billion to NATO, exceeding the NATO target of 2% at 2.12% of GDP.[164] As of May 2024[update], the Bundeswehr has a strength of 180,215 active soldiers and 80,761 civilians.[165] Reservists are available to the armed forces and participate in defence exercises and deployments abroad.[166] Until 2011, military service was compulsory for men at age 18, but this has been officially suspended and replaced with a voluntary service.[167][168] Since 2001 women may serve in all functions of service without restriction.[169] According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Germany was the fifth-largest exporter of major arms in the world from 2019 to 2023.[170] In peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence. In state of defence, the Chancellor would become commander-in-chief of the Bundeswehr.[171] The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany as defensive only. But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994, the term \"defence\" has been defined not only to include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. As of 2017,[update] the German military has about 3,600 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including about 1,200 supporting operations against Daesh, 980 in the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, and 800 in Kosovo.[172][173] Germany has a social market economy with a highly skilled labour force, a low level of corruption,[175] and a high level of innovation.[176] It is the world's third-largest exporter and third-largest importer,[4] and has the largest economy in Europe by nominal GDP, which is also the world's third-largest economy by nominal GDP[177] and sixth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP.[178] Its GDP per capita measured in purchasing power standards amounts to 121% of the EU27 average.[179] The country's service sector contributes approximately 69% of the total GDP, industry 31%‚Äîwith Germany having the largest manufacturing sector in Europe‚Äîand agriculture 1% as of 2017[update].[4] The unemployment rate published by Eurostat amounts to 3.2% as of January 2020[update], which is the fourth-lowest in the EU.[180] Germany is part of the European single market which represents more than 450 million consumers.[181] In 2017, the country accounted for 28% of the eurozone economy according to the International Monetary Fund.[182] Germany introduced the common European currency, the euro, in 2002.[183] Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is headquartered in Frankfurt.[184][174] The automotive industry in Germany is regarded as one of the most competitive and innovative in the world,[185] and is the sixth-largest by production as of 2021. Germany is home to Volkswagen Group, the world's second-largest automotive manufacturer by vehicle production.[186] The top ten exports of Germany are vehicles, machinery, chemical goods, electronic products, electrical equipments, pharmaceuticals, transport equipments, basic metals, food products, and rubber and plastics.[188] Of the world's 500 largest stock-market-listed companies measured by revenue in 2023, the Fortune Global 500, 32 are headquartered in Germany.[189] 30 major Germany-based companies are included in the DAX, the German stock market index which is operated by Frankfurt Stock Exchange.[190] Well-known international brands include Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Opel, Siemens, Allianz, Adidas, Puma, Hugo Boss, SAP SE, Bosch and Deutsche Telekom.[191] Berlin is a hub for startup companies and has become the leading location for venture capital-funded firms in the European Union.[192] Germany is recognised for its large portion of specialised small and medium enterprises, known as the Mittelstand model.[193] These companies represent 48% of the global market leaders in their segments, labelled hidden champions.[194] Research and development efforts form an integral part of the German economy,[195] with the country ranking fourth in research and development expenditure since 2005.[196] In 2018, Germany ranked fourth globally in terms of number of science and engineering research papers published[197] and third in the quality-adjusted Nature Index in 2023.[198] Research institutions in Germany include the Max Planck Society, the Helmholtz Association, and the Fraunhofer Society and the Leibniz Association.[199] Germany is the largest contributor to the European Space Agency.[200] Germany was ranked 9th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.[201] With its central position in Europe, Germany is a transport hub for the continent.[202] Its road network is among the densest in Europe.[203] The motorway (Autobahn) is widely known for having no general federally mandated speed limit for some classes of vehicles.[204] The Intercity Express or ICE train network serves major German cities as well as destinations in neighbouring countries with speeds up to 300 km/h (190 mph).[205] The largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport, Munich Airport and Berlin Brandenburg Airport.[206] The Port of Hamburg is the third-busiest port in Europe and one of the twenty largest container ports in the world.[207] In 2019[update], Germany was the world's seventh-largest consumer of energy.[208] All nuclear power plants were phased out in 2023.[209] Germany meets its power demands using 40% renewable sources, and has been called an \"early leader\" in solar and offshore wind.[210][211] The country is committed to the Paris Agreement and several other treaties promoting biodiversity, low emission standards, and water management.[212][213][214] Germany's household recycling rate is among the highest in the world‚Äîat around 65%.[215] The country's greenhouse gas emissions per capita were the ninth-highest in the EU in 2018[update], but these numbers have been trending downward.[216][217] The German energy transition (Energiewende) is the recognised move to a sustainable economy by means of energy efficiency and renewable energy, with the country being called \"the world's first major renewable energy economy\".[218][219][211] Germany has reduced its primary energy consumption by 11% between 1990 and 2015[220] and set itself goals of reducing it by 30% by 2030 and by 50% by 2050.[221] Domestic and international travel and tourism combined directly contribute over ‚Ç¨105.3 billion to German GDP. Including indirect and induced impacts, the industry supports 4.2 million jobs.[222] As of 2022, Germany is the eighth-most-visited country.[223] Its most popular landmarks include Cologne Cathedral, the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, the Dresden Frauenkirche, Neuschwanstein Castle, Heidelberg Castle, the Wartburg, and Sanssouci Palace.[224] The Europa-Park near Freiburg is Europe's second-most popular theme park resort.[225] With a population of 84.7 million according to the 2023 German census,[226] Germany is the most populous country in the European Union, the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia,[4][g] and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. Its population density stands at 227 inhabitants per square kilometre (590 inhabitants/sq mi). The fertility rate of 1.57 children born per woman (2022 estimates) is below the replacement rate of 2.1 and is one of the lowest fertility rates in the world.[4] Since the 1970s, Germany's death rate has exceeded its birth rate. However, Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s. Germany has the third oldest population in the world, with an average age of 47.4 years.[4] Four sizeable groups of people are referred to as national minorities because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries:[228] There is a Danish minority in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein;[228] the Sorbs, a Slavic population, are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg; the Roma and Sinti live throughout the country; and the Frisians are concentrated in Schleswig-Holstein's western coast and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony.[228] After the United States, Germany is the second-most popular immigration destination in the world.[229] In 2015, following the 2015 refugee crisis, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12 million of all 244 million migrants.[230] Refugee crises have resulted in substantial population increases;[231] for example, the major influx of Ukrainian immigrants following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, meaning over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.[232] As of 2019[update], Germany ranks seventh among EU countries in terms of the percentage of migrants in the country's population, at 13.1%.[233] In 2022, there were 23.8 million people, 28.7 percent of the total population, who had a migration background.[234] Germany has a number of large cities. There are 11 officially recognised metropolitan regions. The country's largest city is Berlin, while its largest urban area is the Ruhr.[235] According to the 2022 census, Christianity is the largest religion at 49.7% of the population; 23.1% identified as Protestant and 25.1% as Catholic.[237] Islam is the second-largest religion in the country.[238] In the 2011 census, 1.9% of respondents (1.52 million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is deemed unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this faith (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question.[239] In 2019, there were an estimated 5.3‚Äì5.6 million Muslims with a migrant background[h] (6.4‚Äì6.7% of the population), in addition to an unknown number of Muslims without a migrant background.[240] Most of the Muslims are Sunnis and Alevis from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites, Ahmadiyyas and other denominations. Other religions each comprise less than one percent of Germany's population.[238] In 2011, formal members of the Jewish community represented no more than 0.2% of the total German population, and 60% of them resided in Berlin.[241] An estimated 80 to 90 percent of these Jews in Germany are Russian-speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who came to Germany from the 1980s onwards.[242][243] A study in 2023 estimated that 46.2% of the population are not members of any religious organization or denomination.[244] Irreligion in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before the enforcement of state atheism, and in major metropolitan areas.[245][246] German is the official and predominantly spoken language in Germany.[247] It is one of 24 official and working languages of the European Union, and one of the three procedural languages of the European Commission, alongside English and French.[248] German is the most widely spoken first language in the European Union, with around 100 million native speakers.[249] Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, Low German, Low Rhenish, Sorbian, Romani, North Frisian and Saterland Frisian; they are officially protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Polish, Italian, Greek, Spanish, Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian and other Balkan languages, as well as Russian. Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.[247] Responsibility for educational supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual states. Optional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years.[250] Secondary schooling is divided into tracks based on whether students pursue academic or vocational education.[251] A system of apprenticeship called Duale Ausbildung leads to a skilled qualification which is almost comparable to an academic degree. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run trade school.[250] This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world.[252] Most of the German universities are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment.[253] The general requirement for attending university is the Abitur. According to an OECD report in 2014, Germany is the world's third leading destination for international study.[254] The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386), Leipzig University (established in 1409) and the University of Rostock (established in 1419) being the oldest.[255] The Humboldt University of Berlin, founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many Western universities.[256][257] In the contemporary era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence. Germany's system of hospitals, called Krankenh√§user, dates from medieval times, and today, Germany has the world's oldest universal health care system, dating from Bismarck's social legislation of the 1880s.[259] Since the 1880s, reforms and provisions have ensured a balanced health care system. The population is covered by a health insurance plan provided by statute, with criteria allowing some groups to opt for a private health insurance contract. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Germany's health care system was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded as of 2013[update].[260] In 2014, Germany spent 11.3% of its GDP on health care.[261] Germany ranked 21st in the world in 2019 in life expectancy with 78.7 years for men and 84.8 years for women according to the WHO, and it had a very low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births). In 2019[update], the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 37%.[262] Obesity in Germany has been increasingly cited as a major health issue. A 2014 study showed that 52 percent of the adult German population was overweight or obese.[263] Culture in German states has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular, and its scientists, writers and philosophers have played a significant role in the development of Western thought.[264] Global opinion polls from the BBC revealed that Germany is recognised for having the most positive influence in the world in 2013 and 2014.[265][266] Germany is well known for such folk festivals as the Oktoberfest and Christmas customs, which include Advent wreaths, Christmas pageants, Christmas trees, Stollen cakes, and other practices.[267][268] As of 2024[update], UNESCO inscribed 54 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List.[269] There are a number of public holidays in Germany determined by each state; 3 October has been a national day of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the Tag der Deutschen Einheit (German Unity Day).[270] German classical music includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich H√§ndel were influential composers of the Baroque period. Ludwig van Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Carl Maria von Weber, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms were significant Romantic composers. Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Wolfgang Rihm are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.[271] In 2013, Germany was the second-largest music market in Europe, and fourth-largest in the world.[272] German popular music of the 20th and 21st centuries includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle, pop, Ostrock, heavy metal/rock, punk, pop rock, indie, Volksmusik (folk music), schlager pop and German hip hop. German electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream pioneering in this genre.[273] DJs and artists of the techno and house music scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g. Paul van Dyk, Felix Jaehn, Paul Kalkbrenner, Robin Schulz and Scooter).[274] German painters have influenced Western art. Albrecht D√ºrer, Hans Holbein the Younger, Matthias Gr√ºnewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder were important German artists of the Renaissance, Johann Baptist Zimmermann of the Baroque, Caspar David Friedrich and Carl Spitzweg of Romanticism, Max Liebermann of Impressionism and Max Ernst of Surrealism. Several German art groups formed in the 20th century; Die Br√ºcke (The Bridge) and Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) influenced the development of expressionism in Munich and Berlin. The New Objectivity arose in response to expressionism during the Weimar Republic. After World War II, broad trends in German art include neo-expressionism and the New Leipzig School.[275] German designers became early leaders of modern product design.[276] The Berlin Fashion Week and the fashion trade fair Bread & Butter are held twice a year.[277] Architectural contributions from Germany include the Carolingian and Ottonian styles, which were precursors of Romanesque. Brick Gothic is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in Renaissance and Baroque art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. Weser Renaissance).[275] Vernacular architecture in Germany is often identified by its timber framing (Fachwerk) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.[278] When industrialisation spread across Europe, classicism and a distinctive style of historicism developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as Gr√ºnderzeit style. Expressionist architecture developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles. Germany was particularly important in the early modernist movement: it is the home of Werkbund initiated by Hermann Muthesius (New Objectivity), and of the Bauhaus movement founded by Walter Gropius.[275] Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century; he conceived of the glass fa√ßade skyscraper.[279] Renowned contemporary architects and offices include Pritzker Prize winners Gottfried B√∂hm and Frei Otto.[280] German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Wolfram von Eschenbach. Well-known German authors include Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Theodor Fontane. The collections of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm popularised German folklore on an international level.[281] The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their Deutsches W√∂rterbuch, or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.[282] Influential authors of the 20th century include Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich B√∂ll, and G√ºnter Grass.[283] The German book market is the third-largest in the world, after the United States and China.[284] The Frankfurt Book Fair is the most important in the world for international deals and trading, with a tradition spanning over 500 years.[285] The Leipzig Book Fair also retains a major position in Europe.[286] German philosophy is historically significant: Gottfried Leibniz's contributions to rationalism; the enlightenment philosophy by Immanuel Kant; the establishment of classical German idealism by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; Arthur Schopenhauer's composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of communist theory by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels; Friedrich Nietzsche's development of perspectivism; Gottlob Frege's contributions to the dawn of analytic philosophy; Martin Heidegger's works on Being; Oswald Spengler's historical philosophy; and the development of the Frankfurt School have all been very influential.[287] The largest internationally operating media companies in Germany are Bertelsmann, Axel Springer SE and ProSiebenSat.1 Media. Germany's television market is the largest in Europe, with over 38 million TV households as of 2012.[288] Around 90% of German households have cable or satellite TV, with a variety of free-to-view public and commercial channels.[289] There are more than 300 public and private radio stations in Germany; Germany's national radio network is the Deutschlandradio and the public Deutsche Welle is the main German radio and television broadcaster in foreign languages.[289] Germany's print market of newspapers and magazines is the largest in Europe.[289] The papers with the highest circulation are Bild, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Die Welt.[289] The largest magazines include ADAC Motorwelt and Der Spiegel.[289] Germany has a large video gaming market, with over 34 million players nationwide.[290] The Gamescom is the world's largest gaming convention.[291] German cinema has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film. After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as Tr√ºmmerfilm (rubble film). East German film was dominated by the state-owned film studio DEFA, while the dominant genre in West Germany was the Heimatfilm (\"homeland film\").[292] During the 1970s and 1980s, New German Cinema directors such as Volker Schl√∂ndorff, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim. The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (\"Oscar\") went to the German production The Tin Drum (Die Blechtrommel) in 1979, to Nowhere in Africa (Nirgendwo in Afrika) in 2002, and to The Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen) in 2007. Various Germans won an Oscar for their performances in other films. The annual European Film Awards ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the European Film Academy. The Berlin International Film Festival, known as \"Berlinale\", awarding the \"Golden Bear\" and held annually since 1951, is one of the world's leading film festivals. The \"Lolas\" are annually awarded in Berlin, at the German Film Awards.[293] German cuisine varies from region to region and often neighbouring regions share some culinary similarities, including with the southern regions of Bavaria and Swabia, Switzerland, and Austria. International varieties such as pizza, sushi, Chinese food, Greek food, Indian cuisine, and doner kebab are also popular. Bread is a significant part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 types of pastries and rolls (Br√∂tchen).[294] German cheeses account for about 22% of all cheese produced in Europe.[295] In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef. Germans produce their ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts and Weisswursts.[296] The national alcoholic drink is beer.[297] German beer consumption per person stands at 110 litres (24 imp gal; 29 US gal) in 2013 and remains among the highest in the world.[298] German beer purity regulations date back to the 16th century.[299] Wine has become popular in many parts of the country, especially close to German wine regions.[300] In 2019, Germany was the ninth-largest wine producer in the world.[301] The 2018 Michelin Guide awarded eleven restaurants in Germany three stars, giving the country a cumulative total of 300 stars.[302] Football is the most popular sport in Germany. With more than 7 million official members, the German Football Association (Deutscher Fu√üball-Bund) is the largest single-sport organisation worldwide,[303] and the German top league, the Bundesliga, attracts the second-highest average attendance of all professional sports leagues in the world.[304] The German men's national football team won the FIFA World Cup in 1954, 1974, 1990, and 2014,[305] the UEFA European Championship in 1972, 1980 and 1996,[306] and the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2017.[307] Germany is one of the leading motor sports countries in the world. Constructors like BMW and Mercedes are prominent manufacturers in motor sport. Porsche has won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race 19 times, and Audi 13 times (as of April 2024[update]).[308] The driver Michael Schumacher has set many motor sport records during his career, having won seven Formula One World Drivers' Championships.[309] Sebastian Vettel is also among the most successful Formula One drivers of all time.[310] German athletes historically have been successful contenders in the Olympic Games, ranking third in an all-time Olympic Games medal count when combining East and West German medals prior to German reunification.[311] In 1936 Berlin hosted the Summer Games and the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Munich hosted the Summer Games of 1972.[312][313] Sources 51¬∞N 9¬∞EÔªø / Ôªø51¬∞N 9¬∞EÔªø / 51; 9",

The country's full name is sometimes shortened to the FRG (or the BRD, in German). To the north of Germany are the North and Baltic Seas, and the kingdom of Denmark. To the east of Germany are the countries of Poland and the Czech Republic. To the south of Germany are the countries of Austria and Switzerland. To the west of Germany are the countries of France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The total area of Germany is 357,021 square kilometres (137,847 square miles). Most of Germany has warm summers and cold winters. In March 2021, Germany had a population of 83.1 million people, the second-largest in Europe after Russia.[10] After the United States, Germany is the second most popular country for migration in the world.[11] Before it was called Germany, it was called Germania. In the years A.D. 900 ‚Äì 1806, Germany was part of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1949 to 1990, Germany was made up of two countries called the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). During this time, the capital city of Berlin was divided into a west and an east part. On 13 August 1961, East Germany started building the Berlin Wall between the two parts of Berlin. West Germany was one of the countries that started the European Union.[12] Germany gained importance as the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, which was the first Reich (this word means empire). It was started by Charlemagne who became the first Holy Roman Emperor in 800 AD, and it lasted until 1806, the time of the Napoleonic Wars.[13] After, German nation-states were made sovereign in Central Europe. During the mid-1800s, Prussia was led by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who is sometimes known as the \"Father of Germany\". He led a process to bring the German people together under one country. In 1866, Prussia won a war against Austria and their allies. During this time, Prussia founded the North German Confederation. The treaty of unification of Germany was made in Versailles after Germany won the Franco-Prussian War in 1871.[14] This began the Second Reich. The biggest state in the new German Empire was Prussia. The rulers were called Kaisers or \"German Emperors\", but they did not call themselves \"Emperors of Germany\". There were many smaller states in the Empire, but not Austria. Germany stayed an empire for 50 years. It joined the other European empires in the Scramble for Africa and fought wars to make large parts of Africa and Oceania its colonies.[15] It killed many Nama and Herero people who did not want to be ruled by Germany.[15][16] Today, those colonies have become seven states: Togo, Cameroon, Namibia, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, and Papua New Guinea.[15] Germany was in World War I with their ally Austria-Hungary, and again declared war on France.[14] The war became slow in the west and became trench warfare. Many men were killed on both sides without winning or losing. In the Eastern Front the soldiers fought with the Russian Empire and won there after the Russians gave up. The war ended in 1918 because the Germans could not win in the west and gave up. Germany's emperor also had to give up his power, and most of Germany's African colonies were taken by other European empires.[14][17] France took Alsace from Germany and Poland got the Danzig corridor. After a revolution, the Second Reich ended, and the democratic Weimar Republic began. After the war, there were a lot of problems with money in Germany because of the Peace Treaty of Versailles, which made Germany pay for the costs of World War I and the worldwide Great Depression.[18] The Third Reich was Nazi Germany; it lasted 12 years, from 1933 to 1945.[19] It started after Adolf Hitler became the head of government. On 23 March 1933, the Reichstag (parliament) passed the Enabling Act, which let Hitler's government command the country without help from the Reichstag and the presidency. This gave him total control of the country and the government.[20] Hitler, in effect, became a dictator. Hitler wanted to unify all Germans in one state and did this by taking over places where Germans lived, such as Austria and Czechoslovakia; Hitler also wanted the land in Poland that Germany had owned before 1918, but Poland refused to give it to him. He then invaded Poland. This started World War II on 1 September 1939. In the beginning of the war, Germany was winning and even successfully invaded France. It managed to take over much of Europe. However, Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941 and after the Battle of Kursk, the German Eastern Front began a slow retreat until war's end. On 8 May 1945, Germany gave up after Berlin was captured, Hitler had killed himself a week earlier. Because of the war, Germany lost a lot of German land east of the Oder-Nei√üe line, and for 45 years, Germany was split into West Germany and East Germany. Other events happened during the war in Nazi Germany, including the Holocaust, the mass genocide of Jews and other peoples, for which some Nazis were punished in the Nuremberg Trials. After World War II Germany was occupied by the allies and in 1949 it was divided into 2 states: West Germany and East Germany, who were stuck in the Cold War. The capital city of Berlin was divided between the two by the Berlin Wall. In 1989 there was a process of reforms in East Germany, which lead to the opening of the Berlin Wall and to the end of socialist rule in Germany. These events are known as the Wende or the Friedliche Revolution (Peaceful Revolution) in Germany. After that, East Germany joined West Germany in 1990.[21] The new Germany is a part of the European Union.[22] Germany is a constitutional federal democracy.[23] Its political rules come from the 'constitution' called Basic Law (Grundgesetz), written by West Germany in 1949. It has a parliamentary system, and the parliament elects the head of government, the Federal Chancellor (Bundeskanzler). The current Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is a man who used to live in West Germany. The people of Germany vote for the parliament, called the Bundestag (Federal Assembly), every four years.[24] Government members of the 16 States of Germany (Bundesl√§nder) work in the Bundesrat (Federal Council). The Bundesrat can help make some laws.[25] The head of state is the Bundespr√§sident (Federal President). This person has no real powers but can order elections for the Bundestag. The current president is Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD). The judiciary branch (the part of German politics that deals with courts) has a Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court). It can stop any act by the law-makers or other leaders if they feel they go against Germany's constitution. The opposition parties are the CDU, CSU, Die Linke and the AfD. Germany is one of the largest countries in Europe. It stretches from the North Sea and Baltic Sea in the north to the high mountains of the Alps in the south. The highest point is the Zugspitze on the Austrian border, at 2,962 metres (9,718 ft).[25] Germany's northern part is very low and flat (lowest point: Neuendorf-Sachsenbande at ‚àí3.54 m or ‚àí11.6 ft). In the middle, there are low mountain ranges covered in large forests. Between these and the Alps, there is another plain created by glaciers during the ice ages. Germany also contains parts of Europe's longest rivers, such as the Rhine (which makes up a part of Germany's western border, while Oder River is on its eastern border), the Danube and the Elbe.[25] In Germany there are sixteen states (Bundesl√§nder): In these states there are 301 Kreise (districts) and 114 independent cities, which do not belong to any district. Germany has a mostly continental climate, but the northern German coast has an oceanic climate. The highest temperature ever recorded in Germany was 41.2 ¬∞C (106.2 ¬∞F), on 25 July 2019 in Duisburg and T√∂nisvorst.[27] The lowest temperature ever recorded in Germany was ‚àí45.9 ¬∞C (‚àí50.6 ¬∞F), on 24 December 2001 in Funtensee.[28] Germany has one of the world's largest technologically powerful economies. Bringing West and East Germany together and making their economy work is still taking a long time and costing a lot of money.[29] Germany is the largest economy in Europe and the fourth-largest in the world by nominal gross domestic product (GDP).[30] In September 2011, the inflation rate in Germany was 2.5%. The unemployment rate of Germany was 5.5% as of October 2011.[31] Germany is one of the G8 countries. The main industry area is the Ruhr area.[32] The country has companies like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Porsche, Siemens, Bosch, SAP, BASF and more. Germany's most exported products are cars.[33] Nearly all German companies are small- or medium-sized.[30] Most of the people in Germany are ethnically Germans, but the country also has many ethnic minorities. There are at least seven million people from other countries living in Germany. Some have political asylum, and some are guest workers (Gastarbeiter). Many people from poor or dangerous countries go to Germany for safety. Many others move to Germany without permission. About 50,000 ethnic Danish people live in Schleswig-Holstein, in the north. About 60,000 Sorbs (a Slavic people) live in Germany too, in Saxony and Brandenburg. About 12,000 people in Germany speak Frisian; this language is the closest language to English that is still spoken today. In northern Germany, people outside towns speak Low Saxon. Most of the people who have come to Germany are from Turkey. Germany has about 1.9 million Turkish immigrants and they own many businesses there. Turkish people introduced the Doner kebab and became a popular fast food in Germany. Other small groups of people in Germany are Croats (0.2 million), Italians (0.6 million), Greeks (0.4 million), Russians, and Poles (0.3 million). There are also some ethnic Germans who lived in the old Soviet Union (1.7 million), Poland (0.7 million), and Romania (0.3 million). These people have German passports, so they are not counted as foreigners. A lot of these people do not speak German at home.[25] Christianity is the biggest religion; Protestants are 38% of the people (mostly in the north) and Catholics are 34% of the people (mostly in the south).[25] There are also many Muslims, while the other people (26.3%) are either not religious, or belong to smaller religious groups.[25] In the eastern regions, the former territory of the GDR (known as the DDR in German), only one fifth of the population is religious. Germany has one of the world's highest levels of schooling, technology, and businesses. The number of young people who attend universities is now three times more than it was after the end of World War II, and the trade and technical schools of Germany are some of the best in the world. German income is, on average, $25,000 a year, making Germany a highly middle class society. A large social welfare system gives people money when they are ill, unemployed, or similarly disadvantaged. Millions of Germans travel outside of their country each year. The four recognized minorities in Germany are Danes 50,000 (concentrated in Schleswig-Holstein state), Frisians 60,000-70,000 (based in Eastern and Northern Frisia), Sorbs 60,000 (primarily in Saxony and Brandenburg) and Romani and Sinti.[34] Germany is a very densely populated country, and especially in cities the housing situation is difficult and rents are high. Already in 2014 there were 39,000 homeless people in Germany and 339,000 people without an apartment.[35] Here is a link to a German video report[36] from a German news magazine. The video is about refugees, who have been living in a sports gym in Berlin for over a year with no privacy. In the video people discuss amongst others why there are problems to find living space in containers. The containers are similar to those in Zaatari refugee camp. Germany's constitution says that all people can believe in any religion they want to, and that no one is allowed to discriminate against somebody because of the person's religion. In ancient times, Germany was largely pagan. Roman Catholicism was the biggest religion in Germany up to the 15th century, but a major religious change called the Reformation changed this. In 1517, Martin Luther said that the Catholic Church used religion to make money. Luther started Protestantism, which is as big as the Catholic religion in Germany today. Before World War II, about two-thirds of the German people were Protestant and one-thirds were Roman Catholic. In the north and northeast of Germany, there were a lot more Protestants than Catholics. Today, about two-thirds of German people (more than 55 million people) call themselves Christian, but most of them do not practice it. About half of them are Protestants and about half are Roman Catholics.[37] Most German Protestants are members of the Evangelical Church in Germany. The previous Pope, Benedict XVI, was born in Germany. Before World War II, about one percent of the country's people were German Jews. Today, Germany has the fastest-growing group of Jewish people in the world. Many of them are in Berlin. Ten thousand Jews have moved to Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall; many came from countries that were in the Soviet Union. Schools teaching about the things that happened when the Nazis were in power, as well as teaching against the ideas of the Nazis, has helped to make Germany very tolerant towards other people and cultures, and now many people move there from countries that may not be so tolerant. About three million Muslims live in Germany, 3.7% of the total population.[37][38] The country also has a large atheist and agnostic population, and there are also large about 0.6 million Hinduism follower and some small group of Jain, Buddhist and Zoroastrian communities. The 20th century has also seen a neopagan revival. Germany has a long history of poets, thinkers, and artists. There are 240 supported theaters, hundreds of orchestras, thousands of museums and over 25,000 libraries in Germany. Millions of tourists visit these attractions every year. Some of the greatest classical musicians including Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven and possibly Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were German. Some of the most revered scientists today like Albert Einstein are German. Artists like Marc Engelhard are active in the 21st century.[39][40][41] Germany has created a high level of gender equality, disability rights, and accepts homosexuality. Gay marriage has been legal in Germany since 2017. Doner kebab is often considered a popular German-Turkish fast food. But more traditional foods of German cuisine are sausage based such as Bratwurst and Currywurst. German food varies from region to region. For example, in the southern regions, such as Bavaria and Baden-W√ºrttemberg, they share their type of food with Switzerland and Austria. Everywhere in Germany, meat is eaten as a sausage. Even though wine use is increasing, the national alcoholic drink is beer. The number of Germans who drink beer is one of the highest in the world. German restaurants are often rated the second-best, with France rated first place. Football (soccer) is the most popular sport in Germany. The national team has won the FIFA World Cup 4 times, and appears in the finals a lot. The top football league in Germany is Bundesliga. Also, the German Football Association (Deutscher Fu√üball-Bund) is the largest in the world. A lot of big football teams are from Germany, like FC Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and many others. Some of the world's best footballers come from Germany too. These would include Mesut √ñzil, Manuel Neuer, Serdar Tasci, Michael Ballack, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franz Beckenbauer, and so on. Plus, many tournaments have taken place in Germany. The most recent was the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. The Audi Cup takes place in Germany every year in Munich. Germany is also known for its motor sports. Successful German racing drivers include Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel. Successful tennis players have also come from Germany, including Steffi Graf and Boris Becker. More recently, Sabine Lisicki reached the Women's Singles final at Wimbledon in 2013. Lastly, Germany is one of the best countries in the Olympic Games. Germany is the third in the list of the most Olympic Games medals in history (mixed with West and East Germany medals). The country finished first place in the 2006 Winter Olympics, second place in the 2010 Winter Olympics. Germany also got fifth place in the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Penn State (11-2) and SMU (11-2) will do battle in frigid weather at noon inside Beaver Stadium. Stay tuned through the afternoon. Penn State's offensive line was dominant in a 45-37 loss to Oregon in the Big Ten title game.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The College Football Playoff has begun, and we're getting a Saturday triple-header of playoff games, the first of which will take place between (6) Penn State and (11) SMU. While there are three different games dealing with wintry conditions this weekend, this is the only one featuring a team with a southern climate heading north to play in the cold. It's a matchup featuring two teams that lost their conference championship games and the bye that would've come with those league titles. However, some argue that the losses could've been silver linings for both because the winner of today's game heads to the Fiesta Bowl to face (3) Boise State and could see themselves favored in that matchup. Before they can look ahead, though, they have to handle business today. Penn State has been one of the best teams in the country all season, and its only two losses have come to (1) Oregon and (6) Ohio State. The Nittany Lions have long been considered the poster child for a program that would most benefit from an expanded playoff field. Sure enough, they're here in its first year. As for SMU, it's been quite the come up for the Mustangs. Making the leap from the AAC to the ACC and nearly winning the league in their first year wasn't the outcome many saw coming, but the Mustangs aren't interested in your underdog stories. They've been determined to prove they belong for years. Keep it locked here as CBS Sports provides you with live updates, highlights and analysis from Penn State vs. SMU in the College Football Playoff on Saturday. You certainly understand the decision to go for it on fourth down given the current score and game state, but it all feels so futile. Jennings is sacked by Dani Dennis-Sutton on fourth down and Penn State has excellent field position in SMU territory. The Nittany Lions have an excellent chance to go up four touchdowns before halftime. Penn State's offense hadn't done much for the first 20 minutes of game action, but it was only a matter of time before the Nittany Lions broke through. The time has come. Kaytron Allen's 25-yard touchdown run caps a nine-play, 75-yard touchdown drive that saw Drew Allar finally settle into the game. Allar was able to extend plays in the pocket and find receivers to extend the drive on third down, and picked up yards with his legs too. It's 21-0 Penn State, and it's fair to wonder how much belief remains on the SMU sideline. SMU takes advantage of the Penn State idiocy by getting a first-and-goal, but on second down, Kevin Jennings' pass is batted in the air and picked off by Dom DeLuca. Again. It's Jennings' third interception of the first half, and DeLuca's second. If there's a silver lining for SMU at least Penn State didn't return this one for a touchdown. The first half has been an absolute nightmare for Jennings and the Mustangs. You have to wonder if SMU might turn to Preston Stone. Facing a fourth-and-1 at their own 19-yard line, and up two scores against a team that can't do anything on offense, James Franklin decides to go for it. Drew Allar is stopped short on a QB sneak, and it's a turnover on downs that hands the ball to SMU in the red zone. I truly have no idea why Penn State did that. It's an awful decision. The Mustangs manage to pick up a first down and get to midfield, but are forced to punt after finding themselves in another third-and-long that leads to an incompletion. The Mustangs just can't get anything going on the ground, which keeps putting them behind the chains, and it's not where this offense is at its best. Factor in that Kevin Jennings looks uncomfortable, and his confidence has to be hurting after two pick-sixes, and it's not an encouraging situation. The Mustangs desperately need their defense to make a play. Another absolute disaster from SMU QB Kevin Jennings, who is not handling the cold weather at all. After SMU is forced to use its second timeout of the half because of crowd noice, Jennings was able to buy time, but made an awful throw while rolling to his right that hit Penn State's Tony Rojas directly in the chest. Rojas then made his way 59 yards to the end zone and it's 14-0 Penn State, with both touchdowns coming via pick sixes. Penn State has an early 7-0 lead on SMU through a quarter that hasn't seen much offense from either side. The lone touchdown in the game came via Penn State's defense when linebacker Dom DeLuca picked off a pass from SMU's Kevin Jennings and took it 23 yards to the house. SMU got off to a great start, moving the ball downfield thanks to a mixture of tempo and a pass interference, but Kevin Jennings made the wrong decision and threw an incomplete pass on fourth down when he could've picked up the first with his legs. Penn State hasn't done much better, and turned the ball over on downs itself late in the first quarter. The two offenses have combined to average 4.1 yards per play. The cold is affecting everybody but the defenses so far. An excellent job by the SMU defense disguising its blitz on third down, which leads to confusion. Drew Allar moves Nick Singleton to his left to pass block and then a blitz comes from the right to get home. Penn State goes for it on fourth because, well, you try kicking a long field goal in the cold and wind. Allar is pressured again, his pass is incomplete, and it's SMU ball at the 29. While SMU's first possession showed promise, things have gone the opposite direction since the turnover on downs. SMU responds to the pick six by going three and out and shanking a punt 25 yards. Penn State gets the ball at its 32-yard line. It has not been a pretty offensive game by either side so far. Neither QB looks very comfortable in the cold, and the run games aren't finding much traction against these defenses. That was absolutely the last thing SMU needed. After a run on 1st down is stonewalled, Kevin Jennings drops back to throw on second down, and his pass sails over his target's head into the waiting arms of Dominic DeLuca, who houses it 23 yards for six. It's 7-0 Penn State. Drew Allar doesn't look comfortable. He was indecisive on the first possession, and still looked indecisive on the second, though the Nittany Lions had more success moving the ball this time. Still, on third-and-8, Allar's pass is well wide of his target, and the Lions are forced to punt. SMU starts its second possession at the SMU 20. The bad news for SMU is that its decision on fourth down didn't work out. Kevin Jennings bootlegged and could've picked up a first with his legs but saw Matthew Hibner open downfield, so he threw to him, but the ball was jarred loose by a big hit. The good news is that while the Mustangs came up empty, they moved the ball pretty well, and their early tempo caused problems for the Penn State defense. Still, you'd have liked it to end with points if you're the Mustangs. Instead it's Penn State ball at the 20. Two quick completions to set up a third and short, but Drew Allar can't find anybody on third down. Seemed a bit hesitant. It looked like he could've hit Kaytron Allen on a dump-off to pick up the first, or scramble for it, but his indecision took away both options. SMU starts at its 32 following the punt. SMU won the toss, deferred, and Penn State will begin at the PSU 30-yard line. We've got three playoff games to get through today, folks. Let's hope this first one sets the tone for an outstanding day of football. The current forecast for today's game has temperatures in the mid-20s, but with a steady wind that'll make it feel closer to 15 degrees for those in Beaver Stadium. However, if you were hoping for a snow game, odds are we won't see one today. While there's a chance of snow, it won't be enough to have an impact on the game itself. As for how the cold can impact a game, while we make a big deal about teams like SMU coming north from Texas to play in this weather, it's important to remember Penn State has never played a home game this late in December, either! It's not like the Nittany Lions play in this weather frequently! The cold and wind has a greater impact on special teams as far as performance is concerned. The passing offenses will be effected by the wind too, and the ball could be a little more difficult to catch if it's \"harder\" than usual. Other than that, the cold is more of a mental test than anything. Different approaches are being taken here, though. SMU's Preston Stone began the season as the team's starter but lost his job to Kevin Jennings. Stone is still with the team and will remain with them during their playoff run while continuing to look for a roster spot elsewhere. Penn State's Beau Pribula saw plenty of snaps as part of a unique offensive package with the Nittany Lions this year, but he has left the team after entering the portal. If either starting QB goes down with an injury, SMU would be in better position than Penn State. When looking for an example of two programs benefitting from the expanded field, look no further than this game. While it's the first CFP appearance for both, Penn State was always viewed as the poster child of programs who would benefit most from expansion. The Nittany Lions typically find themselves finishing in the top 12 every season but were always behind either Ohio State or Michigan in the pecking order. As for SMU, this is a testament to self-belief. SMU joined the ACC without a cut of the league's television revenue because it wanted the chance to prove itself at the Power Four level. All coach Rhett Lashlee and his team did is reach the ACC Championship Game and College Football Playoff in their first ACC season. Here's what I wrote earlier this week if you're looking to make a fun wager on today's game: The weather could have an impact here; the current forecast has temperatures in the low-30s with snow possible. That's a bit concerning, but the more I look at the matchup, the more I feel like we're going to see a shootout. Penn State's offense has been one of the most explosive offenses in the country (16.1% explosive play rate, 5th nationally) and can put points on the board in a hurry. Tight end Tyler Warren is a matchup nightmare that I'm not sure SMU has an answer for, and he should have a big game. While I worry a little about backup QB Beau Pribula leaving the team because of his impact in certain situations, his absence will be felt more down the road should Penn State advance. With or without him, Penn State should have plenty of success on the ground. Don't get me wrong, SMU's defensive front was better than expected, but it wasn't nearly as dominant against Clemson in the ACC Championship Game, and this Penn State offensive line may be the best it has seen all year. On the other side, Penn State has a phenomenal defense, but if there's a weak spot, it's that it is prone to giving up big plays (it ranks 50th in explosive play rate allowed). I can see SMU hitting big plays to get itself in scoring position, and the wild card is Mustangs QB Kevin Jennings. Looking at Penn State's schedule, I don't know if there's a QB they've seen this season with Jennings' skill set. Yes, the Nittany Lions have seen mobile QBs, but nobody with the overall athleticism as Jennings. His ability to evade pressure and pick up first downs with his legs to keep drives alive will be critical in this game. In the end, I have Penn State winning, but I'm more confident in the winner needing to score at least 30 points. The Pick: Over 52.5 ¬© 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. TAMPA, Fla. (AP) DJ Lagway and Florida put together a strong finish to a difficult season. They closed it out in the Gasparilla Bowl. Lagway shook off a mistake-filled first half to throw for 305 yards and a touchdown in Florida's sloppy 33-8 victory over Tulane on Friday. Trey Smack kicked a Gasparilla Bowl-record four field goals for the Gators (8-5), who also got a late TD run from walk-on running back Anthony Rubio, son of U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, in their fourth consecutive victory. ‚ÄúGreat to finish the right way,‚Äù Florida coach Billy Napier said. Tulane (9-5), which played without starting quarterback Darian Mensah, was outgained 529 yards to 194 and didn't score until Ty Thompson threw a TD pass in the final minute. A true freshman who sparked Florida's turnaround from a 3-3 start to the season, Lagway finished 22-of-35 passing with two interceptions that contributed to the Gators only leading 6-0 at halftime. Late in the game, Lagway mishandled a snap on fourth-and-1 only to have running back KD Daniels scoop up the ball and run 25 yards for a touchdown. Rubio, a 5-foot-9 redshirt freshman from Miami who had not appeared in a college game, entered in the fourth quarter. With 449-pound defensive lineman Desmond Watson lined up in the backfield in front of him, he ran for 8 yards on his first carry and eventually finished a nine-play drive with a 9-yard run that increased Florida's lead to 33-0. Watson, a 6-foot-5 senior who wears No. 21, gained 1 yard for a first down on the only carry of his career. ‚ÄúYou saw the sideline light up when he ran on the field,‚Äù Napier said, adding the plan to use Watson in a goal-line or short-yardage situation was hatched one day on the practice field. Initially, he was to be used exclusively as a blocker or a decoy in the passing game. Watson was elated when a play was added to give him an opportunity to run the ball. ‚ÄúI can do it all,‚Äù the nose tackle said, smiling. The Gators won five of seven after their disappointing start, with most of the surge coming after athletic director Scott Strickin guaranteed Napier would return in 2025. Lagway became the starting quarterback after Graham Mertz was lost to a season-ending knee injury in October. Tulane, which lost its last three games, played without Mensah, who entered the transfer portal and decided to continue his career at Duke after leading the Green Wave to an appearance in the American Athletic Conference championship game, where they lost to Army. A loss in the regular-season finale to Memphis knocked Tulane out of the Top 25. ‚ÄúI hate the way it ended,‚Äù Tulane coach Jon Sumrall said. Thompson, who transferred to Tulane from Oregon in 2024, made his first college start - and possibly played his final game for the Green Wave. He also has entered the transfer portal, with the intent of finding a team that wants him to start full-time, though he hasn't ruled out the possibility of returning to the Green Wave. Tulane avoided a shutout when Thompson tossed a 16-yard TD pass to Mario Williams. The Green Wave quarterback finished 11 of 29 for 125 yards and three interceptions. Lagway showed flashes of why Florida feels good about its future with him running the offense, but also made some poor decisions with the ball. His end-zone interception cost the Gators at least three points, and he also was unable to get the ball into the end zone after a 38-yard completion to Chimere Dike gave Florida a first down at the Tulane 3 early in the third quarter. Thompson's audition for a shot at the Green Wave's starting job did not go well. The junior generally is a better runner than passer, however he wasn't effective doing either against the Gators. Florida opens next season at home against LIU, while Tulane hosts Northwestern. Both teams begin Aug. 30. --- Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

                "title": "Party City Closing Over 700 Stores: What we Know - Newsweek",
                "content": "Party City is closing all of its stores, according to a corporate meeting that CNN first reported on. Newsweek reached out to Party City's press team for comment via email. Party City has over 700 stores across North American and has been in business for nearly 40 years. CEO Barry Litwin told corporate employees on Friday that Party City would be \"winding down\" operations immediately. Friday is the employees' last day. \"That is, without question, the most difficult message that I've ever had to deliver,\" Litwin said at the meeting, which was conducted over video conference. Litwin pointed to financial challenges, adding that the company's \"very best efforts have not been enough to overcome\" them. \"It's really important for you to know that we've done everything possible that we could to try to avoid this outcome,\" Litwin said. \"Unfortunately, it's necessary to commence a wind-down process immediately.\" A judge signed off on Party City's reorganization plans in September of 2023, which brought the chain out of bankruptcy. Party City filed for bankruptcy in January of 2023, when it had $1.7 billion in debt. The reorganization plan approved in September canceled nearly $1 billion of debt and closed some stores. But Party City was still $800 million in debt after that. In a press release from the end of October, Party City called itself \"a global leader in celebrations industry\" and \"North America's largest party goods retailer.\" Shopping giant Party City has over 700 company-owned and franchise store locations throughout North America. As of 2021, the chain employed 6,400 full-time and 10,100 part-time workers. In a filing from August, Party City's financial adviser, Moelis & Co, estimated that the company was worth between $450 million and $775 million. The company also operates Amscan, which designs, manufactures and distributes celebration products like costumes, decor and tableware. Litwin was hired as Party City's new CEO four months ago, according to a LinkedIn post he wrote at the time. \"Our main priority is to strengthen our financial health, and there is work ahead of us,\" Litwin said in the post. \"However, our success is rooted in our people and culture.\" Litwin has not posted about the closing. His last LinkedIn post was a month ago, in which he touted \"Party City's impressive traffic growth during the crucial Halloween drive period.\" He also still lists himself as the CEO of Party City, as of the time this story was published. Party City has not posted to its X (formerly Twitter) account since October 26, 2023. According to a company press release from October, Party City has over 700 stores in North America. The CEO told employees December 20 is their last day. The closures are effective immediately. The national retailer Big Lots also announced that it is going out of business. Newsweek reached out to Big Lots' press team over email for comment. The company put out a press release December 19 stating saying it is \"preparing to commence going out of business sales at all remaining Big Lots store locations.\" The news release said Big Lots \"does not anticipate completing its previously announced asset purchase agreement with Nexus Capital Management.\" The sale will start in the coming days and the company said its goal is to complete a sale by early January. \"We all have worked extremely hard and have taken every step to complete a going concern sale,\" CEO Bruce Thorn said in the press release. \"While we remain hopeful that we can close an alternative going concern transaction, in order to protect the value of the Big Lots estate, we have made the difficult decision to begin the GOB process.\" Bruce Millard, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at Big Lots, on LinkedIn: \"Yesterday was a tough day at Big Lots. We're starting the process to close all remaining stores. While the news is tough to take, it's not due to a lack of talent in the marketers and merchants on the team. This is one of the strongest groups I've ever had the opportunity to work with!\" Griffin Gold, senior assistant store manager at Spencer's and former Big Lots employee, on LinkedIn: \"I found out about Big Lots closing while at my former store today. While I worked there, this store had a strong sense of community. It's terrible that this is happening less than a week before christmas. I can't even imagine how employees are feeling right now and the stress of losing a job during this time of the year, not to mention in this particular job market.\" Betsy Petrovic, marketing manager at CQL, on LinkedIn: \"Not surprising, but still very sad - and a sign of the increased competition from other retailers and eCommerce. Party City announced today that all employees are terminated and stores are closing. This follows on the heels of BigLots announcing its closure on Thursday. I truly pray for our economy and for those struggling with being out of work, especially during right before the holidays.\" Party City will close effective immediately, and Big Lots will begin holding its going out of business sales at all locations.

                "content": "Party City, a longtime retailer and go-to source for many of party supplies, is closing all its stores and going out of business, according to a report from CNN. Company CEO Barry Litwin told corporates employees in a meeting Friday the company is \"winding down\" operations and and today was their last day working there, CNN reported. The retailer had more than 850 locations in the United States, according to its website, and had been in business for more than 30 years. >24/7 New York news stream: Watch NBC 4 free wherever you are ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important for you to know that we‚Äôve done everything possible that we could to try to avoid this outcome,‚Äù Litwin said, according to the report. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, it‚Äôs necessary to commence a winddown process immediately.‚Äù Litwin just joined the company in August and at the time said, \"I see many opportunities to strengthen our financial performance and build a leading end-to-end celebration experience for consumers.\" The company, headquarted in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey, was known for its party supplies, balloons, holiday decorations and Halloween costumes. Halloween was known to be the retailer's most-important season. NBC New York has reached out to Party City for comment. The retailer has not posted about the closings on it social media channels and did not respond to requests for comment. While Party City employees at a Manhattan store would not comment to an NBC New York crew, one customer said when she asked why an item was $4 at the register instead of the expected $30, she was told by an employee that it's offering discounts because the store was closing. The New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development said it had not received any official WARN labor notices as if early Friday afternoon from the company. It's not clear when the stores will be closing and when its online business might be shutting down. Party City had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2023, but continued to operate its brick-and-mortar locations as well as its online business after the filing. The company planned to close more than 20 stores as part of the process to restructure its debt. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre competing against Walmart, and Target and Amazon and the dollar stores and grocery stores,‚Äù Joe Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group who had covered Party City since its IPO in 2015, told CNBC at the time. The retailer was able to restructure and emerge from Chapter 11 in Oct. 2023. ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to celebrate the successful conclusion of our restructuring and the bright future that lies aheadfor PCHI,‚Äù the then-CEO of Party City Brad Weston said in 2023. ‚ÄúWe have exited the process on stronger financial footing, and I am incredibly appreciative of the tremendous efforts made by our team to get us to where we are today.\" Bloomberg reported Wednesday Party City was exploring the possibility of a second bankruptcy or liquidation amid continued financial challenges. Party City opened a brand-new headquarters building in New Jersey in 2022.",

The company's CEO broke the news to corporate employees Friday that Party City was \"winding down\" operations and it was their last day of employment, CNN reported. The announcement came on a video conference call, which CNN said it had viewed. Party City, which is the country's largest party supply store, has more than 850 locations across 45 states and Puerto Rico. Party City didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. It's yet to acknowledge the report on its website or social media accounts. It's unclear whether stores would be closing immediately or if there would be going-out-of-business sales. CNN reported that store managers have been told all locations would be shut Feb. 1, 2025. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported Party City was planning to file for bankruptcy again, a little more than a year after exiting Chapter 11 protection in October 2023. The news of Party City shutting down comes just one day after Big Lots revealed it would be closing all of its stores. The discount retailer said a sale to a private equity firm fell through, but they still hoped to either revive the deal or find another buyer by early January. It's unclear when the nearly 1,000 remaining Big Lots stores are set to close, or if a completed sale could prevent them from closing. Here is a full list of the current Party City locations, as of Dec. 20, 2024, according to the company website.

                "content": "The Ohio State Buckeyes football team competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, representing Ohio State University in the Big Ten Conference. Ohio State has played its home games at Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio, since 1922.[3] The Buckeyes are recognized by the university and NCAA as having won eight national championships,[4] including six from the major wire-service selectors: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll. The program has also captured 41 conference championships (2 OAC and 39 Big Ten), 10 division championships, and has compiled 10 undefeated seasons, including six perfect seasons (no losses or ties). Seven players have received the Heisman Trophy (second all-time), with the program holding the distinction of having the only two-time winner (Archie Griffin) of the award. As of 2017, the football program is valued at $1.5‚Äì2 billion,[5][6] the highest valuation of any such program in the country. NCAA's first millionaire student-athlete (Quinn Ewers) became such using NIL while in the program. After early attempts at forming a team in 1886 (led by future Nebraska governor Chester Hardy Aldrich) and 1887, football was ultimately established at the university in 1890.[7] On the site of the first OSU game, on the campus of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, on May 3, 1890, the Delaware County Historical Society has set an historical marker.[8] Some histories of Ohio State football credit George Cole, an undergraduate, and Alexander S. Lilley with introducing the sport to the campus. More recent research has challenged that claim, stating that George Cole did not persuade Lilley to coach the football team until after its first full season began that fall.[8] OSU's first home game took place at 2:30 p.m. on November 1, 1890. They played the University of Wooster on the site that was then called Recreation Park. Just east of historic German Village, the park occupied the north side of Schiller (now Whittier), between Ebner and Jaeger, in what is now Schumacher Place. OSU lost the game, 64‚Äì0. Over the next eight years, under a number of coaches, the team played to a cumulative record of 31 wins, 39 losses, and 2 ties. The first game against the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, was a 34‚Äì0 loss in 1897, a year that saw the low point in Buckeye football history with a 1‚Äì7‚Äì1 record. Jack Ryder was Ohio State's first paid coach, earning $150 per season, and lost his first game, against Oberlin College and John Heisman, on October 15, 1892.[9] In 1899 the university hired John Eckstorm to bring professional coaching skills to the program and immediately went undefeated.[10] In 1901, however, center John Sigrist was fatally injured in a game against Western Reserve University and the continuation of football at Ohio State was in serious question. Although the school's athletic board let the team decide its future, Eckstorm resigned.[11] In 1912, football underwent a number of developments that included joining the Western Conference, making football as part of a new Department of Athletics, and hiring Lynn W. St. John to be athletic director. Chic Harley attended East High in Columbus and was regarded as one of the greatest players to attend an Ohio high school. A well-rounded player, Harley came to Ohio State in 1916 and instantly became a fan favorite. Harley and the Buckeyes won the first Big Ten championship in school history in 1916, finishing 7‚Äì0. The team would repeat in 1917 finishing 8‚Äì0‚Äì1. In 1918, Harley left to be a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I. With Harley's return in 1919, the Buckeyes would only lose one game, to Illinois. Harley left OSU with a career record of 22‚Äì1‚Äì1. At the time, OSU played at the small Ohio Field and Harley brought such record crowds it became necessary to open Ohio Stadium in 1922. The stadium was built entirely on fan donations and several stadium drives around the city where Harley would often appear. In 1951, when the College Football Hall of Fame opened, Harley was inducted as an inaugural member. Ohio State's first rival was Kenyon College, a small liberal arts college in Gambier, roughly 50 miles to the northeast. The Buckeyes first played them in their first season in 1890 on Nov 27, Kenyon won the first two meetings; however, Ohio State won 15 in a row and the rivalry diminished. Kenyon made it their season goal to defeat OSU. After the Bucks joined the Big Ten they stopped playing Kenyon. The all-time record stands at 17‚Äì6, OSU.[12] In hiring Francis Schmidt in March 1934 to coach its football team, Ohio State moved its program to a \"big-time\" level of competition. Schmidt was a well-established coach and an acknowledged offensive innovator. His offensive schemes were a \"wide-open\" style called \"razzle-dazzle\" and led him to be the first Buckeye football coach granted a multi-year contract. Schmidt's first four seasons saw victories over archrival Michigan, all by shut-out. The 1935 squad went 7‚Äì1, its sole loss was to Notre Dame, 18‚Äì13, in the first contest between the programs. However Schmidt's remaining seasons were less successful, except in 1939 when the Buckeyes won the Big Ten championship, and his popularity faded for a number of reasons.[13] On December 17, 1940, he resigned. Ohio State hired the coach of Massillon Washington High School football team, Paul Brown, to succeed Schmidt.[14][15] Brown's Tigers had just won their sixth straight state championship. Brown immediately changed Ohio State's style of offense, planned and organized his program in great detail, and delegated to his assistant coaches using highly structured practices. In 1942, Ohio State lost 22 veteran players to military service as the United States joined World War II, and with a team of mostly sophomores went on to lose only once in winning its first national championship. Brown accepted a commission in the United States Navy in 1944, ending his coaching run prior to the season. When Brown went into the Navy, he directed his assistant Carroll Widdoes to head the team in his absence. The 1944 team fielded 31 freshmen but went undefeated and untied, including a victory over Paul Brown's Great Lakes Navy team. Ohio State finished second in the national rankings behind Army and Les Horvath became the first Buckeye to be awarded the Heisman Trophy. Also prominent on the 1942‚Äì44 teams was the first Buckeye African American star, Bill Willis. Brown chose not to return to Ohio State after the war, going into professional football instead. Widdoes, despite having the highest two-year winning percentage of any Buckeye coach, asked to return to an assistant's position. Offensive coordinator Paul Bixler and Widdoes switched positions, and Bixler endured a mediocre 4‚Äì3‚Äì2 season. Bixler resigned and talk of Ohio State being a \"graveyard of coaches\" became commonplace, a reputation that lingered for decades.[16] Wes Fesler became head coach in 1947 but finished last in the Big Ten for the only time in team history. Ohio State improved greatly in 1948, winning 6 and losing 3, then in 1949 enjoyed a successful season due to the play of sophomore Vic Janowicz. Ohio State received the Rose Bowl invitation, where they came from behind to defeat California. In 1950, Fesler, rumored to be resigning because of pressures associated with the position and abuse of his family by anonymous critics, returned to coach the Buckeyes, who won six games in a row to move into the top ranking in the AP poll. However, the season fell apart as the Buckeyes lost to Michigan during a blizzard, a game that came to be known as the \"Snow Bowl\". Two weeks later, citing concerns about his health and family, Fesler resigned. Wayne Woodrow \"Woody\" Hayes beat out Paul Brown,[17] among others, to be named head coach on February 18, 1951. He instituted a demanding practice regimen and was both aggressive and vocal in enforcing it, alienating many players accustomed to Fesler's laid-back style. The 1951 Buckeyes won 4, lost 3, and tied 2, leaving many to question the ability of the new coach. In 1952, the team improved to 6‚Äì3 and recorded their first victory over Michigan in eight years, but after a 1953 loss to Michigan, critics called for the replacement of Hayes. In 1954, the Buckeyes were picked to finish no higher than 10th in the Big Ten. Hayes, however, had the talents of Howard \"Hopalong\" Cassady, and a historic goal-line stand against Michigan propelled Ohio State to a perfect season. Hayes led the powerhouse Buckeyes to a shared national championship (his first and the team's second). In 1955 the team again won the Big Ten, set an attendance record, and won in Ann Arbor for the first time in 18 years, while Hopalong Cassady was securing the Heisman Trophy. Ohio State passed only three times against Michigan (the sole reception was the only completion in the final three games of the year), leading to the characterization of Hayes' style of offensive play as \"three yards and a cloud of dust\". In a 1955 article in Sports Illustrated, Hayes admitted to making small personal loans to financially needy players.[18] The article resulted in a furor over possible violations of NCAA rules, and the faculty council, followed by the Big Ten and NCAA, conducted lengthy investigations. Big Ten Commissioner Kenneth \"Tug\" Wilson found Hayes and the program guilty of violations and placed it on a year's probation in 1956. In 1957, Ohio State won all of its remaining games after an opening loss to claim the Big Ten championship, then won the Rose Bowl over Oregon, and shared a national title with Auburn, for which Hayes was named Coach of the Year. In 1961, the team went undefeated to be named national champions by the FWAA but a growing conflict between academics and athletics over Ohio State's reputation as a \"football school\" resulted in a faculty council vote to decline an invitation to the Rose Bowl, resulting in much public protest and debate.[19] Over the next 6 seasons, Ohio State finished no higher than 2nd and had a losing season in 1966, and public speculation that Hayes would be replaced as a coach grew to its highest point since 1953. In 1968, Ohio State defeated the number one-ranked Purdue Boilermakers and continued to an undefeated season including a 50‚Äì14 rout of Michigan and a Rose Bowl victory over the USC Trojans that resulted in the national championship. The Class of 1970 became known as the \"super sophomores\" in 1968 and might have gone on to three consecutive national championships except for what may have been the most bitter loss in Buckeye history. The winning streak reached 22 games as Ohio State traveled to Michigan. The Buckeyes were 17-point favorites but directed by first-year coach Bo Schembechler, Michigan shocked the Buckeyes in a 24‚Äì12 upset. The 1969 loss to Michigan initiated what came to be known as \"The Ten Year War\", in which the rivalry, which pitted some of OSU's and UM's strongest teams ever, rose to the uppermost level of all sports and the competition between Schembechler and Hayes became legendary.[20] Four times between 1970 and 1975, Ohio State and Michigan were both ranked in the top five of the AP Poll before their matchup. The Wolverines entered every game during those years undefeated and won only once, a 10‚Äì7 victory in Ann Arbor on November 20, 1971. Both teams used the annual game as motivation for entire seasons and after the initial win by Michigan, played dead even at four wins and a tie apiece. Hayes had the upper hand during the first part of the war, in which Ohio State won the conference championship and went to the Rose Bowl four straight years, while Michigan won the final three. It was also an era in which through television Ohio State football again came to the forefront of national attention. Hayes set the tone in spring practice in 1970, placing a rug at the entrance to the Buckeye dressing room emblazoned with the words: \"1969 MICH 24 OSU 12 ‚Äî 1970 MICH:__ OSU:__\" as a constant reminder of their objective.[21] The \"super sophomores\", now seniors, used a strong fullback-oriented offense to smash their way through the season undefeated, struggling only with Purdue the week before the Michigan game. The return match in Columbus found both teams undefeated and untied, a \"first\" in the history of the rivalry, with Michigan, ranked fourth and Ohio State fifth. Ohio State combined a powerful defense that held Michigan to only 37 yards rushing, a rushing offense employing two tight ends as blockers, and a 26-yard touchdown pass from Kern to Bruce Jankowski to win 20‚Äì9. The Buckeyes returned to the Rose Bowl to be upset by Stanford 27‚Äì17. The \"super sophomores\" had garnered a record of 27‚Äì2, the best winning percentage of any three-year period in team history, and won or shared the Big Ten title all three years. The National Football Foundation named Ohio State as a national co-champion, along with Texas, for 1970 and awarded the teams joint possession of the MacArthur Bowl. 1971 was less successful than the preceding seasons, but the middle four years of the 10-year war saw the greatest success for Hayes against Michigan, although the teams fell short of repeating their 1968 national championship. Archie Griffin began his college football career in 1972, taking advantage of new NCAA eligibility rules that allowed freshmen to compete at the varsity level. In his second game, sent in against North Carolina late in the first quarter, Griffin set a new Buckeye rushing record with 239 yards and led the team in rushing for the season with 867. The following season, Hayes installed an I-formation attack with Griffin at tailback and fellow sophomore Cornelius Greene at quarterback. The Buckeyes went undefeated with a powerful offense and impenetrable defense, achieving an average margin of victory of 31 points a game. The only blemish on their record was a 10‚Äì10 tie with Michigan after both teams had entered the game unbeaten. (The tie was more galling for the Wolverines, however, as the Big Ten selected Ohio State to represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.) Despite soundly defeating defending national champion USC, however, the tie with Michigan resulted in the Buckeyes finishing second to Notre Dame in the final AP rankings. Griffin, Randy Gradishar, Van DeCree, and John Hicks were named All-Americans; Hicks, an offensive tackle, not only won both the Outland and Lombardi Trophies but placed second in the Heisman Trophy competition. 1974 and 1975 were seasons of both elation and frustration. The Buckeyes twice more defeated Michigan, and went to two Rose Bowls, but lost both. The 1974 team seemed bound for another national championship when it was derailed by a loss to unranked Michigan State (Ohio State lost only twice in the regular season during Griffin's four-year career, both to the Spartans), and the next year, the No. 1-ranked Bucks lost 23‚Äì10 to 11th-ranked UCLA in the 1976 Rose Bowl. In all, the Buckeyes were 40‚Äì5‚Äì1 from 1972 to 1975, winning the Big Ten all four years and never losing to Michigan, but it was the losses and ties that proved important to Ohio State missing out on achieving a national championship. At any rate, Archie Griffin rushed for 5,589 yards combined in his four seasons at Ohio State while winning the Heisman Trophy in 1974 (1,695 yards rushed) and 1975 (1,450 yards).[22] The falloff in the success of Hayes' last three years was not great. His teams forged records of 9‚Äì2‚Äì1, 9‚Äì3, and 7‚Äì4‚Äì1, and made bowl appearances in all three years (the rules had changed to allow appearances in other than the Rose Bowl). However, frustrations in losing three straight years to Michigan, and other factors, resulted in growing criticism of Hayes and his methods, particularly his on-the-field fits of temper. Even so, his downfall was sudden and shocking when near the end of the nationally televised Gator Bowl, Hayes punched Clemson middle guard Charlie Bauman after Bauman intercepted a pass to kill Ohio State's last chance to win.[23] Hayes was fired after the game by Ohio State president Harold Enarson and athletic director Hugh Hindman.[24] Hayes was replaced by a former prot√©g√©, Iowa State head coach Earle Bruce.[25] Bruce inherited a strong team led by sophomore quarterback Art Schlichter but that had also lost 11 starters, and the 1979 squad exceeded pre-season expectations, ending the 3-year loss drought against Michigan and going to the Rose Bowl with an opportunity once again to be national champions. The Buckeyes lost both by a single point, 17‚Äì16, but Bruce was named Coach of the Year. His success was hailed by those in the media who saw it as a rebuke of Hayes and the start of a \"new era\".[26] 1980, however, saw the start of a trend that eventually brought criticism to Bruce, when Ohio State finished with a 9‚Äì3 record, the first of six consecutive years at 9‚Äì3. Though each of these seasons, and the 10‚Äì3 season that followed them, culminated in a bowl game, Ohio State did not appear to be any closer to a national championship than during the end of the Hayes era. Bruce's teams were not without impact players, however. All-Americans and future National Football League stars included Keith Byars, Cris Carter, Chris Spielman, John Frank, Jim Lachey, Tom Tupa, Marcus Marek, and Pepper Johnson. His program was also known for the number of notable assistant coaches on staff, including Jim Tressel, Glen Mason, Pete Carroll, Nick Saban, Urban Meyer and Dom Capers. For the first time since 1922, the Buckeyes lost three in a row in Ohio Stadium in 1982, including rematches with Stanford and Florida State, and for the second year in a row to Wisconsin, but then won seven straight, the last over BYU in the Holiday Bowl. Sophomore running back Keith Byars had a stand-out season in 1983, rushing for 1,199 yards, and Ohio State defeated the Oklahoma Sooners in Norman, but three losses in conference meant a 4th-place finish. 1984 witnessed what Bruce called \"the greatest comeback after the worst start\" when Ohio State fell behind Illinois 24‚Äì0 at home but roared back on 274 yards rushing and five touchdowns by Byars to win 45‚Äì38. Ohio State also defeated Michigan to win an outright Big Ten championship. Byars led the nation in rushing and scoring but finished second in Heisman balloting. In 1986, Bruce received a 3-year contract, the first for the modern program but the team opened with two losses, which had not occurred in over 90 years. The Buckeyes then won 9 in a row before Michigan took a close game when kicker Matt Frantz missed a field goal with a minute to play. After the season Bruce was offered the position of head coach at the University of Arizona with a 5-year contract but was persuaded to stay at his alma mater by Athletic Director Rick Bay. Hopes for a standout season in 1987 suffered a serious setback when All-American wide receiver Cris Carter was dropped from the team for signing with an agent. Indiana defeated Ohio State for the first time since 1951, 31‚Äì10, in a game that came to be known as the \"darkest day\",[27] and Ohio State lost three conference games in a row going into the Michigan game. On the Monday of Michigan week, after a weekend of rumors and speculation, Ohio State President Edward Jennings fired Bruce but tried to keep the dismissal secret until after the end of the season. Bay, who had been instrumental in keeping Bruce at Ohio State, disregarded Jennings' orders and announced the firing and his own resignation in protest. Jennings made his own situation worse by refusing to give a reason for the firing and the circumstances have been the subject of controversy since.[28] The Buckeyes enjoyed an emotional come-from-behind victory over Michigan in Ann Arbor after the entire team wore headbands bearing the word \"EARLE\", then declined an invitation to play in the Sun Bowl. John Cooper was hired as the 21st football head coach at Ohio State before the end of 1987 and before he had coached his last game at Arizona State University.[29] Cooper's coaching record at ASU and at Tulsa prior to that stood out among his credentials, as did a victory over Michigan in the 1987 Rose Bowl.[30] Cooper's 13 years as the Buckeye head coach are largely remembered in the litany of negative statistics associated with him: a notorious 2‚Äì10‚Äì1 record against Michigan, a 3‚Äì8 record in bowl games, a 5-year losing streak to Illinois to start his term and a 6‚Äì7 record overall, and blowing a 15-point 3rd quarter lead in a 28‚Äì24 loss to unranked Michigan State when the Buckeyes were the top-ranked team in the nation and en route to a national championship. However, his record also has many positives: back-to-back victories over Notre Dame, two finishes second-ranked in the polls, and three Big Ten championships (albeit shared). Cooper also recruited 15 players who were first-round draft picks in the National Football League.[31] Both 1988 and 1989 began identically: a season-opening win followed by an embarrassing loss to a highly regarded team (Pitt and USC); a rebound win against two other highly regarded programs (LSU and Boston College) followed by a loss to Illinois in the conference opener. However, 1988 saw Ohio State lose its first three conference games and a close game at home against Michigan for a 4‚Äì6‚Äì1 record, its first losing season in 22 years. In 1989 the Buckeyes won 6 consecutive Big Ten games before losing its last two to go 8‚Äì4. The most noteworthy victory occurred in Minneapolis when Ohio State overcame a 31‚Äì0 deficit to Minnesota to win 41‚Äì37. 1990 continued the pattern with a 2-win 2-loss start and an overall 7‚Äì4‚Äì1 record that included an embarrassing loss to Air Force in the Liberty Bowl. 1991 was 8‚Äì4, notable primarily as the season that sophomore running back Robert Smith quit the team. 1992, with senior Kirk Herbstreit at quarterback, and Smith back on the team was 8‚Äì3‚Äì1, but the losing string to Michigan was broken with a 13‚Äì13 tie. Persistent rumors that Cooper would resign or be fired were laid to rest when University President Gordon Gee announced he would be back in 1993.[32] The next six seasons were very successful, winning 10 or more games in five out of six, and sharing the conference championship in three. Eddie George won the Heisman Trophy in 1995 after a tremendous senior season, Ohio State defeated Notre Dame in 1995 and 1996, and won half its bowl games. But in three seasons (1993, 1995, and 1996) the Buckeyes entered the Michigan game undefeated, with the possibility of a national championship in at least one, and lost all three to underdog Wolverine teams. Ohio State had won 62 games and lost only 12, but a third of those were to Michigan. After renewing his contract and becoming a member of the \"million dollar coaching club\",[33] Cooper started sophomore Austin Moherman against the Miami Hurricanes in the nationally televised Kickoff Classic and was soundly beaten. That presaged a mediocre season in which the Buckeyes finished 6‚Äì6, ending their successful 90's run. The 2000 team was more successful, going 8‚Äì4, but criticism of Cooper among fans had risen to a clamor again and touched on many areas of the program beyond specific game records. The negative publicity rose to a peak in the days leading up to Ohio State's matchup with South Carolina in the Outback Bowl, when wide receiver Reggie Germany was suspended for having a 0.0 GPA, team captain Matt Wilhelm publicly criticized fellow player Ken-Yon Rambo, and one Buckeye lineman sued another.[34] On January 3, 2001, Cooper was fired.[35] His loss in the Outback Bowl to a team that had not even won a single game the year before was a factor in his subsequent firing, as was negative publicity regarding player behavior before and during the game. Other contributing factors included the record against Michigan (which was actually considered by most people to be the biggest reason for his firing), a reputation of inability to win \"big games\", the lack of a national championship, the perception of him as an outsider by many alumni, the poor bowl game record, and finally a perceived lack of discipline on the team. Ohio State quickly sought a replacement for Cooper and after a nationwide search hired Jim Tressel.[36] With four NCAA Division I-AA National Championships at Youngstown State University, Tressel, formerly an assistant coach for Earle Bruce, was an Ohioan who was considered to be appreciative of Buckeye football traditions. Although there were some doubts as to whether or not Tressel could repeat his earlier success at the Division 1A level, most fans and alumni met the coaching change with enthusiasm. On the day of his hiring, Jim Tressel, speaking to fans and students at a Buckeye basketball game, made a prophetic implication that he would lead the Buckeyes to beat Michigan in Ann Arbor the following November.[37] Tressel's first season was difficult as the Buckeyes finished 7‚Äì5 (all but one loss was by a touchdown or less), but he made good on his promise, beating Michigan in Ann Arbor. While its fans were optimistic about the chance for success of the 2002 team, most observers were surprised by Ohio State's National Championship.[38][39] Ohio State used strong defense, ball-control play-calling, and field position tactics to win numerous close games, a style of play characterized as \"Tresselball\",[40] and disparaged by detractors as \"the Luckeyes\".[41] The 2006 and 2007 regular seasons ended with just one combined loss and consecutive appearances in the national championship game. The Buckeyes lost both by wide margins. On January 1, 2010, the Buckeyes defeated the Oregon Ducks in The Rose Bowl Game by a score of 26‚Äì17. This ended a 3-game BCS losing streak for Ohio State, having lost 2 national championships and one Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. Terrelle Pryor was named MVP of the contest with 2 touchdown passes for a career-high 266 passing yards. In addition, he had more total yards than the entire Oregon Ducks team. In December 2010, it was announced that five student-athletes on the football team would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season for NCAA violations. The punishments stemmed from an incident when some of the Buckeye players received tattoos for their autographs, according to news reports. Other violations committed by the players included the selling of several items given to them by the university, such as Big Ten championship rings.[42] On December 22, 2010, the NCAA announced that five players would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season due to receiving improper benefits. Mike Adams, Dan Herron, DeVier Posey, Solomon Thomas, and quarterback Terrelle Pryor were found to have signed autographs in return for tattoos, as well as selling memorabilia given to them by the university.[43] In addition, Jordan Whiting was suspended for the season opener for his involvement. The scandal originated at Fine Line Tattoos and Piercings in Columbus, whose owner, Edward Rife, was being investigated for felony drug trafficking. On January 4, 2011, with all the players allowed to participate by the NCAA, the Buckeyes defeated the Arkansas Razorbacks in the Sugar Bowl by a margin of 31‚Äì26.[44] The win, along with every other one from the 2010 season, would later be vacated due to the scandal. The Buckeyes finished the season 12‚Äì1, with their only official game being a loss to Wisconsin. On March 8, 2011, OSU suspended head coach Jim Tressel for the first 2 games of the 2011 season and fined him $250,000 for not informing the university and the NCAA that he had knowledge of his players receiving improper benefits. Coach Tressel's suspension would later be increased to 5 games by the university. On May 30, 2011, Jim Tressel resigned as head coach of the Buckeyes.[45] On June 6, 2011, a story in Sports Illustrated reported that at least 28 players, including Rob Rose, T. J. Downing, Louis Irizarry, Chris Vance, C. J. Barnett, Dorien Bell, Jamaal Berry, Bo DeLande, Zach Domicone, Storm Klein, Etienne Sabino, John Simon, Nathan Williams, Jermale Hines, Devon Torrence, Donald Washington, Thaddeus Gibson, Jermil Martin, Lamaar Thomas, and Doug Worthington traded team memorabilia or used equipment for tattoos or other merchandise or services between 2002 and 2010. The report alleged that Tressel had violated NCAA bylaw 10.1, unethical conduct, three times by not acting when told of the tattoo improprieties, by signing a statement saying he knew of no violations, and for withholding information on what was going on from university officials.[46] On July 8, 2011, Ohio State University decided to vacate all victories from the 2010 football season as self-imposed punishment for major NCAA violations.[47] Former coach Jim Tressel received more than $52,000 from the university and didn't have to pay a $250,000 fine for his involvement in the scandal. His status was also changed from \"Resigned\" to \"Retired\" in keeping with his wishes to \"remain a Buckeye for life\".[48] Ohio State named Luke Fickell interim head coach for the 2011 season following Tressel's resignation, and Fickell coached the 2011 Buckeyes to a 6‚Äì7 record; going 6‚Äì6 in the regular season and losing in the Gator Bowl to Florida. On November 28, 2011, former University of Florida head coach and ESPN college football analyst Urban Meyer accepted the position of Buckeyes head coach.[49] Meyer assumed head coaching responsibilities following the Buckeyes' January 2012 Gator Bowl appearance. Meyer's first season at Ohio State did not include a postseason contest, as the Buckeyes were sanctioned with a one-year bowl ban on December 20, 2011. The NCAA sanctions also included the loss of three scholarships each year for the following three years and three years' probation to end on December 19, 2014. Ohio State was required to vacate all wins from the 2010 season, the 2010 Big Ten Conference championship and their win in the 2011 Sugar Bowl. The school's share of the Sugar Bowl proceeds was forfeited as well.[50] In Meyer's first year, the Buckeyes went a perfect 12‚Äì0, winning the 2012 Big Ten Leaders Division, though the previously mentioned sanctions kept them from playing in the 2012 Big Ten Football Championship Game and a postseason bowl game.[50] On November 23, 2013, the Buckeyes clinched their second straight Leaders Division Championship, after defeating Indiana 42‚Äì14. With the victory over Indiana, Ohio State set a team record for all-time consecutive wins, with 23. The following week, Ohio State defeated Michigan 42‚Äì41 in Ann Arbor, to increase the streak to 24. The streak ended with Ohio State's 34‚Äì24 loss to Michigan State in the 2013 Big Ten Conference Championship game on December 7, marking Meyer's first loss as the Buckeyes' head coach. On January 3, 2014, the Buckeyes were defeated by Clemson in the Orange Bowl 40‚Äì35. On November 22, 2014, the Buckeyes clinched the first-ever Big Ten East Division Championship when they defeated Indiana 42‚Äì27, earning a berth in the 2014 Big Ten Championship Game, where they defeated West Division champion Wisconsin 59‚Äì0 to win the Big Ten Conference Championship and qualified for the four-team playoff to decide the National Champion. OSU defeated Alabama in the Sugar Bowl 42‚Äì35, on January 1, 2015, to qualify for the National Championship Game against Rose Bowl winner Oregon on January 12 (the Rose and Sugar Bowls were the designated semifinal games in 2014). OSU claimed the first-ever College Football Playoff National Championship by defeating Oregon 42‚Äì20.[51][52][53] The 2015 season for the Buckeyes began with a 10‚Äì0 start before losing on a last-second field goal to Michigan State on November 21, ending the Buckeyes' quest to repeat as National Champions. However, the Buckeyes recovered their 2 next games with dominating wins over Michigan and then over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl to finish the season at 12‚Äì1. The 2016 season started off great with 6 straight victories, including a win over the Oklahoma Sooners, but the streak came to an end as the team lost a heart-breaker to the Penn State Nittany Lions. The Buckeyes went on to win the rest of their regular-season games, finishing 11‚Äì1. They did not play in the Big Ten Championship as Penn State took the division. In a controversial call, the College Football Playoff committee gave Ohio State a spot in the Playoff. Ohio State lost in the Fiesta Bowl to the Clemson Tigers in an embarrassing 31‚Äì0 loss, ending the season 11‚Äì2. The 2017 season started out on a high note with a victory over the Indiana Hoosiers, but the next week the Buckeyes fell to the Oklahoma Sooners. The Buckeyes won the next 6 games, including a win over No. 2 Penn State in a revenge game of sorts. The Buckeyes suffered an embarrassing defeat against the Iowa Hawkeyes. The Buckeyes ended the season 12‚Äì2 overall, winning the rest of their games including a Big Ten Championship victory over Wisconsin and a Cotton Bowl victory over USC. Urban Meyer was suspended for the first three games of the 2018 season for mishandling domestic violence allegations against then-wide receivers coach Zach Smith. Co-Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Ryan Day served as interim coach and led the Buckeyes to a 3‚Äì0 start. Meyer returned to the sidelines and coached the team to four more victories before the team suffered a loss on October 20 to Purdue, 49‚Äì20. The Buckeyes won their last four games of the regular season, including a 62‚Äì39 win over archrival Michigan, in Columbus. The win gave the Buckeyes a share of the Big Ten East Division title, and the right to face Northwestern in the Big Ten Championship Game, which Ohio State won for its second consecutive Big Ten Championship. Ohio State would go on to win the Rose Bowl over Pac-12 Champion Washington 28‚Äì23, giving Ohio State their 8th Rose Bowl win. On December 4, 2018, the university announced that Meyer would retire after the 2019 Rose Bowl and be replaced by co-offensive coordinator Ryan Day.[54][55] In Day's first year, the Buckeyes went a perfect 13‚Äì0, including a win over archrival Michigan by a score of 56‚Äì27 and defeating Wisconsin for the Big Ten Championship. They would earn a spot in the College Football Playoff but would lose to Clemson 29‚Äì23 in the 2019 Fiesta Bowl. In Day's second year, the Big Ten season didn't start until late October due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Buckeyes would only play five out of a scheduled eight games due to several virus-related cancellations - including the Michigan game. Nevertheless, the Buckeyes would go 5‚Äì0 in the regular season, win the East Division title, and go on to beat Northwestern 22‚Äì10 in the Big Ten Championship Game, giving Day his second straight conference title. On January 1, 2021, the Buckeyes defeated Clemson 49‚Äì28 to win the Sugar Bowl in a rematch of the 2019 Fiesta Bowl to advance to the CFP National Championship Game against Alabama on January 11, which they lost 52‚Äì24. On September 11, 2021, he suffered his first regular season loss as head coach when the Oregon Ducks defeated the Buckeyes 35‚Äì28 in the 2nd game of the season. Ohio State's streak of defeating Michigan also came to an end on November 27, 2021, in Ann Arbor, when Ohio State lost 42‚Äì27.[56] They then won the 2022 Rose Bowl against Utah 48‚Äì45 on January 1, 2022. In 2022, Day led the team to an 11‚Äì0 record and was ranked #2 going into the Michigan game, which #3 Michigan would win 45‚Äì23 on November 26, 2022 (outscoring the Buckeyes 28‚Äì3 in the second half), in Ohio State's first loss to Michigan in Columbus since 2000, and first back‚Äìto‚Äìback losses to Michigan since 1999‚Äì2000. The Buckeyes would go on to play the defending national champion Georgia Bulldogs in the 2022 national semifinal game on New Year's Eve, taking a 14-point lead into the fourth quarter, but ultimately seeing their season come to an end with a 42‚Äì41 loss.[57] Kicker Noah Ruggles' would-be game-winning field goal attempt sailed wide left just as the clock struck midnight on New Year's Day, 2023. In 2023, Day led the team to an 11‚Äì0 record and was ranked #2 going into the Michigan game for the second consecutive year. This time, Michigan won by six points 30‚Äì24 on November 25, 2023. This marked the first three game losing streak to Michigan since 1995‚Äì97. The Buckeyes were then invited to the 2023 Cotton Bowl, where they lost to the Missouri Tigers 14‚Äì3 on December 29, 2023. Ohio State recognizes eight national championships from NCAA-designated \"consensus\" selectors,[58][59] including six (1942, 1954, 1957, 1968, 2002, 2014) from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[59][60] The following is a list of Ohio State's claimed national championships: Ohio State has also been selected an additional seven times by various NCAA-designated \"major selectors\", in 1933, 1944, 1969, 1973, 1974, 1975, and 2006.[59][63][64] However, the Buckeyes do not recognize any of those championships. Ohio State joined the Big Ten in 1912; before that they were a member of the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) and won two OAC titles. Ohio State has won a championship in the Big Ten 39 times, second-most in the conference.[65] ‚Ä† Co-champions From 2011 to 2023, Big Ten had divisions to decide who would play for the conference championship. The divisions were known as Legends and Leaders from 2011 to 2013. In 2014, the divisions were realigned geographically into East and West. The divisional format ended for the 2024 season. ‚Ä† Co-champions Ohio State has played in 55 bowl games in which they are 27‚Äì29‚Äì0.[66] The Buckeyes have been to the Rose Bowl 16 times. Below are the team's most recent bowl games. ‚Ä† Vacated Ohio State University Marching Band[68] is the most visible and possibly best-known tradition of Ohio State football.[69] Home games are preceded by four marching band traditions:[70] The series versus Illinois began in 1902 and became the longest continuous series in 2002 when the schools played in their 89th consecutive year. In 2007, Ohio State was given their only defeat of the regular season by the Illini. Through the 2019 season, Ohio State leads the series 68‚Äì30‚Äì4.[71] Ohio State's first game with Michigan dates to 1897. Michigan leads the series 62‚Äì51‚Äì6 through the 2024 season.[72]This rivalry is considered to be Buckeyes' biggest rivalry. All the appearances of the letter M in Ohio Stadium are crossed out with red tape. Halftime shows during OSU games often feature something bad happening to the Michigan logo. When Penn State was added to the Big Ten conference football play in 1993, every member was given two designated rivals, teams to be played every year, with the other conference teams rotated out of the schedule at regular intervals. For geographic convenience, the Big Ten named Penn State as Ohio State's new designated rival in addition to Michigan. Ohio State leads the series 25‚Äì14 through the 2024 season.[73] The Buckeyes have had 24 head coaches in their 121-year history. Of the team's eight national championships to date, Woody Hayes won five, with Paul Brown, Jim Tressel, and Urban Meyer each having one. Roster Last update: August 22, 2024 [74] This table reflects the results of Big Ten match-ups when both OSU and its opponent were members of the conference through November 9, 2019.[75] Ohio State began Big Ten play in 1913. Examples of excluded results are Chicago after 1939, Michigan between 1907 and 1916, Michigan State before 1953, Penn State before 1993, and Nebraska before 2011 (see Big Ten History for further information). Ohio State's vacated wins from 2010 are not included (see 2010 Ohio State Buckeyes football team for further information). Through the 2006 season, Ohio State players have by a significant margin won more trophies than any other NCAA Division 1A program. Ohio State players have won 34 of the listed major awards, with the next closest being 26 (Oklahoma). Ohio State is the only university to have received each of the awards at least once. Of the five awards created prior to 1980 (Heisman, Lombardi, Maxwell, Outland, and Walter Camp), Ohio State has received the most with 25 (Notre Dame follows with 23). Although these numbers are cited as \"retired\" on Ohio State website,[76] they are considered enshrined rather than retired, and are available to be worn. All previously retired jersey numbers remain retired.[77] In 2020, the NCAA approved the use of the No. 0.[78] In order to further pay tribute to Bill Willis, Coach Day decided to start a new tradition and choose the player who will wear the number each season.[79] Note: Due to number restrictions, Thayer Munford could not wear number 0. Instead, he wore his regular number and honored the award with a patch. Two head coaches have also been honored by the Buckeyes, with banners at Ohio Stadium: Ohio State players have won the Heisman Trophy seven times, which ties Notre Dame and Oklahoma for the second most awards for any school, behind only USC with eight. Archie Griffin is the only two-time recipient in the history of the award.[80] Ohio State players have won the Lombardi Award six times: Four Ohio State players have won the Maxwell Award: Four Ohio State players have won the Outland Trophy: Ohio State players have won the Walter Camp Award four times: Ohio State Players have won the Fred Biletnikoff Award twice: Ohio State Players have won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy award twice: Ohio State players have won the Dick Butkus Award twice: Ohio State players have won the Jim Thorpe Award twice: Ohio State players have won the Dave Rimington Trophy four times: Ohio State players have won the Chicago Tribune Silver Football award 23 times: Ohio State players have won the Graham‚ÄìGeorge Offensive Player of the Year 13 times: Ohio State players have won the Nagurski‚ÄìWoodson Defensive Player of the Year 11 times: Through 2017, 199 Buckeyes have been named first team All-Americans since 1914. Of those 85 have been consensus picks. 388 have been named to the All-Big Ten team, and 16 have won the Chicago Tribune Silver Football, the Big Ten's Most Valuable Player award, including Troy Smith for 2006. The Athletic Directors of the Big Ten Conference voted Eddie George Big Ten-Jesse Owens Athlete of the Year for 1996. On November 22, 2006, ten Buckeyes were named to either the Coaches or Conference media All-Big Ten First Team selections for the 2006 season, and seven were named to both. Troy Smith was named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year. Four other Buckeyes received Second Team honors.

                "content": "Sol√°na Imani Rowe (born November 8, 1989), known professionally as SZA (/Ààs…™z…ô/ SIZ-…ô), is an American singer-songwriter. She first gained recognition through her self-released EPs See.SZA.Run (2012) and S (2013), which helped her become the first female artist to sign with Top Dawg Entertainment. Her third EP, Z (2014), was her first project to be released to digital retailers and reached the top-ten on the U.S. Independent Albums chart. After signing a joint recording contract with RCA Records, SZA released her debut studio album, Ctrl (2017). It was met with critical and commercial success, earning four Grammy Award nominations and becoming the second longest-charting R&B album by a female artist on the Billboard 200.[1] The following year, SZA was nominated for the Golden Globe and Academy Awards for Best Original Song via her collaboration with Kendrick Lamar on the U.S. and UK top-ten single \"All the Stars\".[2] Her featured appearance on Doja Cat's \"Kiss Me More\" broke the record for the longest-running all-female collaboration within the U.S. top ten,[3] and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. SZA's second album, SOS (2022), spent ten non-consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200 and broke the record for the largest streaming week for an R&B album in the U.S. Supported by six singles, including the top-ten songs \"Good Days\",[4] \"I Hate U\",[5] \"Nobody Gets Me\" and \"Snooze\", SZA earned her first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 with \"Kill Bill\" in 2023. She later earned her second chart-topping single of the year with her guest appearance on Drake's \"Slime You Out\". In December 2024, SZA released the deluxe reissue to SOS, titled Lana. She will start her acting debut in the Issa Rae-produced film One of Them Days (2025). SZA has received several accolades in her career, including four Grammy Awards, a Brit Award, an American Music Award, a Guild of Music Supervisors Award, and two Billboard Women in Music awards (including Woman of the Year). As a songwriter, she has co-written songs for Nicki Minaj, Beyonc√©, Travis Scott, Schoolboy Q, and Rihanna. In 2024, she was honored with the Hal David Starlight Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame.[6] Sol√°na Imani Rowe was born on November 8, 1989, in St. Louis, Missouri. She grew up in Maplewood, New Jersey, often returning to St. Louis to visit her mother's family.[7][8][9][10] Her father was an executive producer at CNN, while her mother was an executive at AT&T. Rowe has an older half-sister, Panya Jamila.[8][11] Her mother is Christian and her father is Muslim.[11] She was raised as a Muslim and continues to follow Islam.[8] It's like the belief in one God, all the pillars of Islam et cetera, and I think those are ideas that will never leave me, those make sense in my spirit. It's the way that I connect with God; it has always made sense to me. I think I would love to wear my hijab but I feel like I don't wanna wear my hijab and talk crazy on stage and be in videos with Travis Scott. Like I don't wanna be disrespectful because I have too much love and respect for the religion, for my father, and for myself.[12] She attended a Muslim prep school every day after her regular schooling, where she used to wear hijab. After the September 11 attacks, Rowe was subjected to bullying in 7th grade, leading her to stop wearing one.[8][13] Rowe attended Columbia High School, where she was active in sports, including gymnastics and cheerleading.[14][12] After graduating from high school in 2008,[15] Rowe later went to three separate colleges, finally settling at Delaware State University to study marine biology.[8][11] She eventually dropped out in her last semester, taking on a variety of jobs in order to make money.[11][16][17] Rowe formed her stage name from the Supreme Alphabet, taking influence from rapper RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. The last two letters in her name stand for Zig-Zag and Allah, while the first letter S can mean either savior or sovereign.[8] SZA first met members of Top Dawg Entertainment during the CMJ New Music Report in 2011, when her boyfriend's clothing company sponsored a show in which Kendrick Lamar was performing. Her early music was given to TDE president Terrence \"Punch\" Henderson, who was surprised with the quality of the material.[18] The two stayed in touch, and after SZA began generating buzz with the release of her two EPs, TDE stepped in to sign her in 2013, making her the label's first female artist. SZA's early music was recorded with her friends and neighbors in which they \"stole a bunch of beats off the Internet\".[16] On October 29, 2012, SZA self-released her debut EP See.SZA.Run.[19] On April 10, 2013, SZA released her second EP, S, which was met with positive reviews from music critics.[20][21] SZA promoted the extended play with the release of a music video for the song \"Ice Moon\", directed by Lemar & Dauley.[22] On July 14, 2013, Top Dawg signed SZA.[23] In October 2013, SZA went on a four show tour with Swedish band Little Dragon; starting on October 17 at the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles and ending on October 24 at the Music Hall of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY.[24] In December 2013, SZA released the song \"Teen Spirit\" which was followed by the release of a remix featuring American rapper 50 Cent, along with a music video directed by APlusFilmz.[25] In 2014, SZA featured on a variety of songs from her label-mates albums including two songs for Isaiah Rashad's debut EP Cilvia Demo as well as featuring on Schoolboy Q's first album Oxymoron.[26][27] On March 26, 2014, she released the single \"Child's Play\" featuring Chance the Rapper and produced by Dae One & XXYYXX.[28] A studio EP, Z, was released on April 8, 2014; the lead single, \"Babylon\" was accompanied with a music video directed by APlusFilmz.[29] To promote Z, SZA performed at several performance showcases at the SXSW Music Festival in Austin, Texas.[29] SZA made her chart debut in the UK, where Z charted at number thirty-two on the R&B Charts, during the week ending April 19, 2014.[30] Z debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 at number thirty nine, selling 6,980 copies in its opening week; the album also peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hip hop/R&B chart.[31] SZA subsequently began recording her fourth EP, A.[32] In July 2014, SZA featured on Kitty Cash's single \"Moodring\".[33] Later that month, SZA released a collaboration with Jill Scott called \"Divinity\".[34] On July 11, 2014, SZA released a video for her song \"Julia\" from Z.[35] In December SZA and The Internet supported Aiko's \"Enter The Void\" tour.[36] On November 18, 2014, SZA released a song called \"Sobriety\".[37] Whilst working on A, (now repackaged as her debut album[38] and later retitled Ctrl), SZA began writing songs for other women including Beyonc√© and Rihanna. Along with Rihanna and Tyran Donaldson, SZA co-wrote \"Consideration\" for Rihanna's album Anti (2016); besides writing, SZA also appeared on the track and later performed \"Consideration\" with Rihanna live at the 2016 Brit Awards on February 24, 2016.[39][40] After signing a contract with RCA Records on April 28, 2017,[41][42] SZA released Ctrl, her debut studio album, on June 9. Originally scheduled for 2015, the release was marred by several delays rooted in disagreements between SZA and Top Dawg executives. She had been stressing over curating the right tracks and erasing any perceived imperfections from the album that one day, in 2016, she posted on Twitter to say she would quit music and let Punch release Ctrl. Sometime in mid-2017, an unknown person took the hard drive that contained the music.[43] Ctrl was released to universal acclaim from music critics, scoring an 86 out of 100 rating on Metacritic.[44] It also debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200,[45] with 125,000 album-equivalent units, of which 80,000 were pure album sales. The album was supported by several singles; the first, \"Drew Barrymore\", was released in January 2017.[46] The second, \"Love Galore\", peaked in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart and was later certified platinum.[47] Ctrl was ranked as the best album of 2017 by Time.[48] From August 2017 to February 2018, SZA promoted the album on a North American and Oceanic concert tour consisting of more than fifty shows.[49] SZA opened for the European portion of Bryson Tiller's \"Set It Off Tour\" in support of his album True to Self from October 17, 2017, to November 30, 2017, separate from SZA's tour.[50] In August 2017, SZA collaborated with American pop rock band Maroon 5 on their single \"What Lovers Do\" from their sixth studio album Red Pill Blues. The single reached number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100. This marked SZA's first top-ten hit as a featured artist on the Hot 100. The following month SZA released \"Quicksand\", which appeared on the soundtrack for HBO's Insecure,[51] and, alongside Khalid and Post Malone, was featured on the remix version of Lorde's single \"Homemade Dynamite\", from her second studio album Melodrama.[52] Also in 2017, SZA worked on a joint album with Mark Ronson and Tame Impala.[53] On November 28, 2017, SZA received five Grammy nominations including one for Best New Artist. She received the most nominations of any women artist for the 2018 Awards and was the fourth most nominated artist in total.[54] Despite this, she did not end up winning any of the awards she was nominated for.[55] In January 2018, SZA featured with Kendrick Lamar on the track \"All the Stars\", which was released as the lead single to the soundtrack album of the film Black Panther.[56][57] The single peaked at number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100, and this made SZA's second top-ten hit on the chart, after Maroon 5, \"What Lovers Do\" which peaked at number 9 on the chart. SZA collaborated with Cardi B on the track \"I Do\" for Cardi's album Invasion of Privacy.[58] In May 2019, SZA featured on DJ Khaled's eleventh studio album, Father of Asahd, on the track \"Just Us\". A music video was later released for the song.[59] On February 26, 2020, SZA and Justin Timberlake released \"The Other Side\", a song part of the Trolls World Tour soundtrack, alongside its music video.[60] In March 2020, SZA signed with WME for representation in all areas.[61][62] SZA performed, together with artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi and Halsey, a benefit concert for the state of New Jersey, in support of the state's work fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. It took place on April 22, 2020, through at-home performances and the revenue will go to the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund.[63][64] On May 25, 2020, SZA showed interest on Twitter in releasing \"a music dump\" of previously unreleased material, potentially containing 20 songs.[65] In August 2020, SZA tweeted and deleted, \"At this point y'all gotta ask punch\", referring to Terrence \"Punch\" Henderson, who is president of Top Dawg Entertainment. In another tweet, SZA indicated that \"all [Punch] says to her\" about releasing new music is \"soon\".[66] This revealed that her relationship with her label owner Punch (Top Dawg Entertainment) has been hostile since the delays of her second album which was last announced back in an interview in 2019.[67] SZA came back with her first release as a lead artist since 2017 on September 4, 2020, with \"Hit Different\", featuring Ty Dolla Sign, and production from The Neptunes.[67][68] On December 25, 2020, SZA released \"Good Days\" on streaming platforms as a single after it originally debuted as a snippet in the outro of the \"Hit Different\" music video.[69] English singer Jacob Collier provided background vocals for the single.[70] The song hit its peak of number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100,[71] making it SZA's first top-ten single as a solo artist, despite SZA herself revealing that it was not initially planned to be a single.[72] Both tracks were expected to appear on her then upcoming second studio album, with only \"Good Days\" eventually making the final cut.[73] On April 9, 2021, SZA was featured on the Doja Cat single \"Kiss Me More\". It became a number-one hit in New Zealand and reached the Top 40 in over a dozen countries, further having earned top-ten placements in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland and Lithuania. The song also has a music video which premiered the same day as the single and was directed by Warren Fu. In late 2021, SZA's cover of \"The Anonymous Ones\" was released. It is a song written for the soundtrack of the 2021 film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen. Her version of the song also plays during the closing credits of the film itself.[74] A collaboration from SZA with Summer Walker, \"No Love\" was released on November 5, 2021, after previously being teased back in late June via Walker's Instagram.[75] After its success on the R&B charts, it later became an official single when the extended version was released in March the following year, along with a music video. On December 3, 2021, SZA released the song \"I Hate U\", after it went viral on TikTok; it was originally released exclusively on SoundCloud in August 2021.[76] SZA confirmed after the 64th Annual Grammy Awards that she had finished her second album and is planning on releasing it \"soon\".[77] On June 9, 2022, SZA released a deluxe version of her debut studio album Ctrl to commemorate its 5-year anniversary. It featured 7 previously unreleased songs, such as \"2AM\", \"Jodie\", \"Percolator\", and an alternative version of \"Love Galore\" without Travis Scott. On October 28, 2022, a new single titled \"Shirt\" was released alongside a music video starring actor LaKeith Stanfield.[78] The song was originally teased by SZA in late-2020 and after it gained popularity on TikTok because of a viral challenge, a snippet appeared as an outro at the end of the official music video of \"Good Days\".[79] SZA teased another snippet of a song at the end of the \"Shirt\" music video, which she revealed to be called \"Blind\".[80][81] On her 33rd birthday on November 8, 2022, SZA released a teaser titled \"PSA\" on her Instagram. The video ends with a morse code for \"S.O.S.\", sparking speculations about an upcoming project.[82][83] On November 16, 2022, Billboard officially confirmed that her second studio album is titled SOS and was set for a December release date.[84] On November 30, 2022, SZA posted the cover of her upcoming album SOS to her Instagram account.[85] After performing \"Shirt\" and \"Blind\" on NBC's Saturday Night Live, SZA announced that the album would be released on December 9, 2022.[86] The album spent its first seven weeks atop the Billboard 200 Albums Chart in the United States, becoming the longest-running number-one woman album of the decade and the first R&B album to spend its first seven weeks atop the chart since Whitney Houston's Whitney (1987).[87] To promote the album, SZA embarked on an arena tour in 2023 and 2024‚Äîthe SOS Tour.[88][89] The tour consists of 63 shows across North America, Europe, and Oceania.[90] Omar Apollo, d4vd, Raye, and Sir served as the opening acts for each of the four legs.[91][92] On November 22, 2024, labelmate Kendrick Lamar released his sixth studio album GNX. SZA was prominently featured on its third track, \"Luther\", providing vocals on two verses as well as its chorus. She also appeared on the album's closing track, \"Gloria\", performing the chorus and outro.[93] On November 25, 2024, SZA announced she would release a new album before the end of the year on Kai Cenat's Mafiathon 2 Twitch stream that also featured Lizzo. She also did a interview with British Vogue where she said that she had 'projects in development'.[94] She will make her acting debut in the Issa Rae-produced film One of Them Days (2025), alongside Keke Palmer. Growing up, SZA was exposed by her family to artists from different genres, which were formative influences for her music.[95] Her mother enjoyed R&B and church music,[96] her father was a fan of jazz and funk musicians like Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, and John Coltrane,[13][97] and her sister listened to melodic rap and hip hop artists like Tupac Shakur.[1][95] SZA listens to Ella Fitzgerald for vocal influence[98] and has said that Lauryn Hill is one of her personal influences.[99] SZA has expressed admiration for singer Ashanti, citing her as a major inspiration and someone she has loved since childhood.[100] SZA also cites Meelah, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, LFO, Macy Gray, Common, Bj√∂rk, Jamiroquai, and \"a lot of Wu, Nas, Mos Def, Hov\" as inspirations.[8] Speaking on her influences, SZA said: \"[My] personal influences came from dancing with American Ballet Theatre and doing pieces to Bj√∂rk [music]. That's the only time I had really any outside influence to music. So, the people that I fell in love with on a musical level were always much older. Jamiroquai is just, like, the shit for me.\"[101] In an interview for Live Nation Entertainment, SZA described the meeting she had with Beyonc√© for the writing of the song \"Feeling Myself\", affirming \"Beyonc√© might be the most perfect, beautiful being I've ever met in my whole life. She's the most inspirational woman on earth, next to my mother\". SZA also spoke about Rihanna, admiring her strong and confident attitude, of someone who does only the music she wants to do, and that if there's anybody that she could imagine singing her words, it would be Rihanna.[102] SZA's songs are built over \"layers of sliced, delayed, and reversed vocals\" and contains \"twists and mutates\",[103][19] and her vocal style has been described as taking on the \"lilt\" of a jazz singer.[104] SZA is known as TDE's first woman signee and first singer, which also drew attention during the early stages of her career.[105] According to Marissa G. Muller of Rolling Stone magazine, SZA's vocals alternate between a \"vapory husk and a sky-high falsetto\".[106] Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork magazine labeled SZA's vocals as being \"chillwave\" and \"ethereal\".[107] SZA began writing songs due to being \"passionate\" about writing, and enjoyed poetry; when writing lyrics, SZA \"freestyles\" them in order to express whatever comes to her \"mind\", noting that it does not always make sense to herself.[16] Thematically, SZA's work contains \"unravelling lyrics\", that touch upon themes of sexuality, nostalgia, and abandonment.[103] Critics have frequently described SZA as an R&B singer-songwriter,[108][109] a narrative for which she has expressed disdain[110] consistently since the beginning of her career.[111][112] The label felt disrespectful and lazy to her.[113] For her second studio album, SOS, she wanted to prove her versatility beyond R&B, disillusioned with how Black artists have been historically segregated from White artists through pigeonholing Black artists strictly within R&B music.[114][115] Other critics have written she combines R&B with rap[116][117] or pop music in her works,[118] and their attempts to pin her down to genres outside R&B has had SZA confused. She grew up listening to an eclectic combination of pop, rock, jazz, folk, and rap artists[115][119] and, as such, prefers to be labeled as someone who makes music and nothing more. She said: \"when you try to label it, you remove the option for it to be limitless. It diminishes the music.\"[119] \"Genre agnosticism\" was how Michael Madden of Consequence described SZA's musical style.[120] During an interview, SZA said she is less inspired by strictly music, and more inspired by creating art in general; she has looked up to people who were not \"typical artists\" including her \"favorite gymnast, ice-skater, saxophonist, painter, or movie director\", continuing to say she was particularly inspired by film director Spike Lee.[101] During an interview with W, SZA spoke on her style influences, saying a large amount of her style inspiration comes from movies, including Wes Anderson films, praising his use of \"pantone color palette\" and that she \"would love to dress like a character from Moonrise Kingdom. Or perhaps Bill Murray in The Life Aquatic.\"[121] Along with her music, SZA's image has been compared to neo-soul artists Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu.[105] SZA's hair became a point of interest during the early stages of her career and she discussed it in interviews with Vogue and Harper's Bazaar.[99] During her performances, SZA tends to wear \"free-flowing\" clothes that are easy to move around in and wears pajamas or baggy clothing onstage.[122] SZA has been open about her struggles with mental health and anxiety, calling the music industry \"one of the most stressful, psychosis-inducing industries\".[123] She experienced suicidal depression after three ex-boyfriends died in quick succession, and says she worked toward self-acceptance by praying and creating music.[11] SZA dated Canadian rapper and singer Drake in 2009,[124] and was in a relationship with a fashion designer for eleven years, being engaged for five.[125] Headlining Co-headlining Supporting In her career, SZA has received four Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe nomination, and an Academy Award nomination. She has earned one American Music Award, six Billboard Music Award, four MTV Video Music Awards, six BET Awards, including Best New Artist in 2018 and Album of the Year in 2023. She received the \"Rulebreaker Award\" and \"Women of the Year\" at the Billboard Women in Music event in 2018 and 2022 respectively. SZA has also won the Soul Train Music Award for Best New Artist in 2017. In September 2022, SZA was applauded as one of the rising stars on the TIME 100 Next List.[126] At the 2022 Grammy Awards, SZA won Best Pop Duo/Group Performance with Doja Cat for their hit collaboration \"Kiss Me More\".[127] In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked SZA at number 180 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[128]",

                "content": "The Six Triple Eight is a 2024 American war drama film written and directed by Tyler Perry, on the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, an all-Black and all-female battalion, in World War II.[2] The film features an ensemble cast which includes Kerry Washington, Ebony Obsidian, Milauna Jackson, Kylie Jefferson, Shanice Shantay, Sarah Jeffery, Pepi Sonuga, Moriah Brown, Gregg Sulkin, Susan Sarandon, Dean Norris, Sam Waterston and Oprah Winfrey. The Six Triple Eight was released in select cinemas on December 6, 2024, before its streaming debut by Netflix on December 20, 2024. The film is based on the 2019 WWII History magazine article, \"Fighting a Two-Front War\", by Kevin M. Hymel on the contributions of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, an all-Black and all-female battalion, in World War II. It was announced in December 2022 that Tyler Perry would be writing and directing the film Six Triple Eight for Netflix.[3] The film is based on historian Kevin M. Hymel's article, \"Fighting a Two-Front War\", published in the February 2019 issue of WWII History magazine.[4] In January 2023, the cast, including Kerry Washington, Sam Waterston, Susan Sarandon and Oprah Winfrey was announced, with Washington also joining as an executive producer.[5] Filming began on January 17, 2023, in Atlanta.[6] Production also occurred in Little Germany, Bradford and at Imperial War Museum Duxford in February.[7][8] Filming took place in Cedartown, Georgia on March 28, 2023.[9] In February 2024, Six Triple Eight was reported to be part of Netflix's 2024 release calendar, with a specific date yet to be announced.[10][11][12] In August 2024, it was announced that the film, now titled The Six Triple Eight, would be released in a limited theatrical release on December 6, 2024, with a streaming release two weeks later on December 20 on Netflix.[13] The Six Triple Eight received mixed reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 44% of 25 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10.[14] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 56 out of 100, based on nine critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[15] Film critic Peter Debruge from Variety gave it a positive review, writing: \"The Six Triple Eight gives Perry his best and most substantial feature to date (only 2010‚Äôs ensemble melodrama For Colored Girls comes close)... The film boasts a large enough cast to launch a dozen or so careers, and yet, one performance stands head and shoulders above the others: That would be Washington‚Äôs forceful turn as Adams, who holds her own against arrogant white officers.\"[16] Frank Scheck from The Hollywood Reporter also gave it a positive review, praising Obsidian and Washington' performances.[17] Jesse Hassenger from The Guardian gave it 2/5 stars, writing: \"Kerry Washington hams it up in the writer-director‚Äôs stodgy ode to a battalion of women in the second world war who deserve far better\".[18]",

                "title": "Texas Longhorns football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "This is an accepted version of this page The Texas Longhorns football program is the intercollegiate team representing the University of Texas at Austin (variously Texas or UT) in the sport of American football. The Longhorns compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Their home games are played at Darrell K Royal‚ÄìTexas Memorial Stadium in Austin, Texas. With over 900 wins, and an all-time win‚Äìloss percentage of .704, the Longhorns rank 4th (tied) and 12th on the all-time wins and win‚Äìloss records lists, respectively. Additionally, the program claims 4 national championships, 33 conference championships, 100 First Team All-Americans (62 consensus and 25 unanimous), and 2 Heisman Trophy winners. Beginning in 1893, the Texas Longhorns football program is one of the most highly regarded and historic programs of all time.[4] From 1936 to 1946 the team was led by Hall of Fame coach Dana X. Bible,[5] and then from 1957 to 1976 the team was led by Hall of Fame coach Darrell K Royal,[6] who won three national championships.[7] The first championship was in 1963 and the second was in 1969.[6] In 2009, ESPN ranked Texas as the seventh-most prestigious college football program since 1936.[8] In 2012, the football program was valued at $805 million,[9] more than the calculated value of several NFL teams.[citation needed] Texas is known for their post-season appearances, ranking second in number of bowl game appearances (55),[10] fourth in bowl game victories (29), most Southwest Conference football championships (27), and most Cotton Bowl Classic appearances[11] and victories. Other NCAA records include 108 winning seasons out of 122 total seasons, 24 seasons with 10 or more wins, 9 undefeated seasons, and 26 seasons with at most one loss or tie. From 1936 to 2012, the Longhorns football teams have been in the AP or coaches' rankings 66 out of 76 seasons (86.8% of the time), finishing those seasons ranked in the top twenty-five 48 times and the top ten 28 times. Texas claims four Division I-A national championships (1963, 1969, 1970 and 2005) and 33 conference championships (4 Big 12 Conference, 27 Southwest Conference, and 2 Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association). A total of 129 (53 consensus and 22 unanimous) Texas players have been named to College Football All-America Teams, while two Longhorn players, Earl Campbell (1977) and Ricky Williams (1998), have won the Heisman Trophy,[12] \"College football's most prestigious individual honor\".[13] Seventeen Longhorns have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, while four are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. At the start of the 2019 season, Texas' all-time record was 909‚Äì371‚Äì33 (.705), which ranked as the third-most wins.[14][15] By the end of the season, Texas' record was 916‚Äì375‚Äì33 (.704), losing a spot and dropping to fourth in NCAA Division I FBS overall history.[16] In July 2021, after 25 seasons as members of the Big 12, Texas and rival Oklahoma accepted invitations to join the Southeastern Conference (SEC) no later than the 2025 season.[17] In February 2023, the Big 12 announced that the two schools had negotiated a combined $100 million early termination fee in order to leave for the SEC a year before the schools' media rights deal with the Big 12 was set to expire.[18] The Longhorns football team continued competing in the Big 12 through the 2023 season before moving to the SEC in 2024. Texas has been affiliated with four conferences and twice been an independent.[19] Texas has been selected national champion in 9 seasons from NCAA-designated major selectors, including 4 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[20]: 107‚Äì109 The 1963, 1969, 1970, and 2005 championships are claimed by the school, while the remainder are not claimed.[21] Texas has won 33 conference championships, 27 outright and six shared, spanning three conferences, the Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the Southwest Conference, and the Big 12 Conference.[25][19] ‚Ä† Co-champions Texas has won a share of 7 Big 12 South titles, 5 of which resulted in an appearance in the Big 12 Championship Game. Texas is 3‚Äì2 in those appearances. As of 2011, the new ten-team Big 12 Conference ceased to have divisions and conference championship games.[26] ‚Ä† Co-champions At the end of the 2018 season, Texas is tied for second in all time bowl appearances in the NCAA FBS at 55, matching Georgia and trailing Alabama's 70 appearances.[27] (Note: Some years Texas went to two bowls although they were in different seasons) ^ The 2006 Rose Bowl was both the Rose Bowl Game and the sanctioned BCS National Championship Game, after that season the BCS NCG became a separate game unaffiliated with the major bowl games. ‚Ä† The Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston was discontinued in 1988, but was replaced by the Houston Bowl (2000‚Äì2001) and the Texas Bowl (2006‚Äìcurrent). ‚Ä° The Freedom Bowl merged with the Holiday Bowl in 1995. Texas has played in four Bowl Championship Series games (including two BCS National Championships) and one New Year's Six bowl. Texas also played in two Bowl Alliance games (the precursor to the BCS): the 1995 Sugar Bowl and the 1997 Fiesta Bowl. There have been 31 head coaches since the inaugural team in 1893, with Steve Sarkisian being the current head coach of the Longhorns.[28] The Longhorns have played their home games in Darrell K Royal‚ÄìTexas Memorial Stadium (formerly just \"Memorial Stadium\" and \"Texas Memorial Stadium\") on Campbell-Williams Field[29] since 1924. The stadium is located on the campus of The University of Texas in Austin, Texas. The current official stadium capacity is 100,119,[30] making it the second largest football venue in the state of Texas,[31] the fifth largest in the SEC Conference,[32] the fifth largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA, and the seventh largest non-racing stadium in the world. The stadium has been expanded several times since its original opening, and now includes 100,119 permanent seats, the nation's first high definition video display in a collegiate facility nicknamed \"Godzillatron,\"[33] and a newly renovated Joe Jamail Field with FieldTurf. The current DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium and Big 12 attendance record was set on September 15, 2018, against USC with 103,507 spectators. The final planned phase of the stadium's expansion includes the construction of permanent seating and an upper deck in the south end zone, completely enclosing the playing field. The stadium's seating capacity is expected to reach 112,000 once the south end zone is fully enclosed, which would mean DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium would surpass Michigan Stadium as the largest football stadium in North America.[34] However, the date of the final construction phase to fully enclose the south end zone has not been set nor have any funds been raised. Varying sources claim this phase may not take place for upwards of 10 to 15 years, though on March 11, 2014, an announcement was made that an exploratory committee has been formed regarding the expansion of the stadium in conjunction with the construction of the Dell Medical School on campus. Before the Longhorns football team moved to DKR, they played their home games at Clark Field from 1887[35] to 1924. Clark Field was a wooden-structured stadium located on the University of Texas campus.[36] The Longhorns last game at Clark Field before moving to brand new Memorial Stadium occurred on October 25, 1924. The Longhorns battled the Florida Gators to a 7‚Äì7 tie that day.[37] Texas finished with a record of 135‚Äì23‚Äì3 during their time at Clark Field.[38] Texas has a long-standing rivalry with the University of Oklahoma. The football game between the University of Texas and Oklahoma is commonly known as the \"Red River Rivalry\" and is held annually in Dallas at the Cotton Bowl. Dallas is used as a \"neutral site\" since it is approximately midway between the two campuses. The stadium is split, with each team having an equal number of supporters on each side of the 50 yard line. Texas state flags fly around the Longhorn end of the stadium and Oklahoma state flags fly around the Sooner end. This border rivalry is often considered to be one of the top five current rivalries in the NCAA. The Red River Shootout originated in 1900, while Oklahoma was still a territory of the United States, and it is the longest-running college-football rivalry played on a neutral field.[39] Since 2005, the football game has received sponsorship dollars in return for being referred to as the \"SBC Red River Rivalry\"[40] (changed to AT&T Red River Rivalry in 2006 after SBC merged with AT&T), a move which has been criticized both for its commercialism[41] and its political correctness.[42] The University of Texas holds its annual Torchlight Parade during the week of the Red River Rivalry.[43] In 2005, the Dallas Morning News did an opinion poll of the 119 Division 1A football coaches as to the nations top rivalry game in college football. The Texas-OU game was ranked third.[44] The game typically has conference or even national significance. Since 1945, one or both of the two teams has been ranked among the top 25 teams in the nation coming into 60 out of 65 games. Twice Texas has defeated the Sooners a record eight straight times from 1940 to 1947 and 1958‚Äì1965. One of the most significant meetings was in 1963 with Oklahoma ranked No. 1 and Texas ranked No. 2, the game won by Texas 28‚Äì7 en route to their first officially recognized national championship. The series has also had its share of games that came down to the wire and comebacks most recently in 2021 which saw sixth-ranked Sooners rallying from a 21-point first-quarter deficit to edge the 21st-ranked Longhorns 55‚Äì48 in the highest-scoring game in the rivalry. The game has also been the result of controversy. The meeting in 1976 was a heated affair as the Oklahoma staff was accused of spying on Texas' practices, a move later confirmed by former OU head coach Barry Switzer. In the 2008 season Texas scored 45 points over then No. 1 Oklahoma for the win, but even with the victory Texas would not go on to the Big 12 Championship game due to BCS rankings. Six of the last ten showings featured one of the participants in the BCS National Championship Game (2000, 2003‚Äì2005, 2008, 2009), including national titles won by Oklahoma in 2000 and by Texas in 2005. On October 6, 2018, the Longhorns and Sooners squared off in a Red River Rivalry game that will go down in history. After giving up a 21-point 4th Quarter lead, the Longhorns found themselves tied at 45 with the Sooners with just over two minutes left to play in the game. As the Longhorns began to systematically march down the field, time began to run out. However, a Cameron Dicker 40 yard field goal sealed a 48‚Äì45 win for the Longhorns and finally ended the 2-year drought in the Red River Rivalry. In 2022, Texas shut out Oklahoma, beating them 49-0. This was the most dominant win by either side since 2003, and the first shut out since 2004. Texas leads the all-time series 63‚Äì51‚Äì5 through the 2023 season.[45][46] In 2023 Oklahoma surpassed Texas A&M as UT‚Äôs most played football rivalry game. The first meeting between the Texas Longhorns and Texas Tech Matadors (as the team was known until 1937) was in 1928, a 12‚Äì0 win for Texas. The teams only faced each other nine times before 1960 with Texas holding an 8‚Äì1 record over Tech at the time.[47] From 1960 to 1995, both schools played annually as members of the Southwest Conference. Since 1996, both schools have played as members of the Big 12 Conference.[48] In 1996, the Texas Tech University System was established and the system's first chancellor, John T. Montford, a former member of the Texas State Senate, started the exchange of a traveling trophy between the two universities called the Chancellor's Spurs.[49][50] The spurs are gold and silver and engraved with Texas Tech's Double T and Texas' interlocking UT logo and were first awarded to Texas after a 38‚Äì32 victory over the Red Raiders in Lubbock.[50] Texas leads the all-time series 54‚Äì18 through the 2023 season.[51] Old Southwest Conference rivals, Texas and Arkansas first met in 1894, a 54‚Äì0 win by Texas. In the days of the Southwest Conference, the game between the two schools usually decided which team would win the conference championship. Overall, Texas won the game about 71% of the time, which led to an incredibly fierce and intense rivalry. The two programs have met 79 times and have had many big games. The meeting in 1969 is the true Game of the Century commemorating the 100th year of college football, which led to the Longhorns' 1969 national championship. This game, which is commonly known as \"Dixie's Last Stand\" and The Big Shootout, still does not sit well with Razorback fans to this day.[52] The game saw Arkansas lead throughout only to have Texas come from behind and win in the final minutes, 15‚Äì14. The game also saw former President Richard Nixon attend the game and crown the Longhorns the National Champion in the locker room. The Texas-Arkansas game has not been played annually since Arkansas's departure from the Southwest Conference to the Southeastern Conference in 1991. However, many Longhorn and Razorback fans still consider this matchup an important rivalry. Texas and Arkansas played in September 2008, with Texas winning, 52‚Äì10. Texas and Arkansas also played in the 2014 Texas Bowl, which Arkansas won, 31‚Äì7. Texas and Arkansas played in the 2021 regular season, with Arkansas winning by a score of 40-21. Texas leads the series 57‚Äì23 through the 2024 season.[53] The first meeting between the football squads of the University of Texas and Texas A&M was in 1894, a 38‚Äì0 win for Texas. In fact, Texas won its first seven games against the Aggies, all of them by shutout. By 1915 Texas held a 15‚Äì4‚Äì2 advantage against the Aggies. The game was a back and forth affair for the next twenty years as the home team usually took the victory in the game, however Texas still maintained the series lead. In 1940, Texas shutout the Aggies 7‚Äì0 and kept them from receiving the Rose Bowl bid that year. From that year forward Texas would go on to win 33 of the next 38 games over A&M. It was not until the mid-1980s that A&M developed a win streak over Texas and in the late 1990s and 2000s the rivalry would again go back to Longhorns.[54] The Texas/Texas A&M rivalry has given rise to several stereotypes on both sides: Texas A&M is generally portrayed as the rural smaller school while Texas is portrayed as the urban-wealthy larger school. With the exception of the 1994 game, when A&M's probation restricted the Aggies from being televised, the annual football game with Texas A&M traditionally takes place on Thanksgiving Day or the day after each year. This iconic in-state rivalry is often considered one of the top college rivalries of all time. In July 2011, Texas A&M elected to join the Southeastern Conference beginning in 2012, which ended of the 118-year consecutive meetings between the two schools. On November 24, 2011, Texas faced Texas A&M in College Station in the final scheduled meeting of the rivalry as of January 2019. Texas defeated Texas A&M 27‚Äì25 on a last second field goal to win the final meeting. In an attempt to generate more attention for the rivalry in sports other than football, the two schools created the Lone Star Showdown[55] in 2004. Essentially, each time the two schools meet in a sport, the winner of the matchup gets a point. At the end of the year, the school with the most points wins the series and receives the Lone Star Trophy. Texas leads the series 76‚Äì37‚Äì5 through the 2023 season.[56] The rivalry will resume when Texas moves to the Southeastern Conference in 2024. Baylor and Texas have played each other 111 times, with the first game between Baylor and Texas being played in 1901. Only Oklahoma and Texas A&M have played Texas more times than Baylor. Both Baylor and Texas were founding members of the Southwest Conference and the BIG 12 Conference. Texas leads the series with Baylor 81-28-4. However, starting in 2010 this rivalry intensified as Baylor established themselves as a major contender in the BIG 12 Conference with Baylor playing for 4 BIG 12 titles and winning 3, including a head-to-head win over Texas to clinch the BIG 12 Championship in 2013, in what is now known as the \"Ice Bowl\".[57] Losing the BIG 12 Title to Baylor 30-10 was Mack Brown's last regular season game as the head coach at Texas. Since 2015, Texas holds a 7-2 edge in the series with Baylor.[58] Texas leads the series with TCU 64‚Äì28‚Äì1 through the 2023 season.[59] Texas leads the series 75‚Äì21‚Äì1 through the 2023 season. The teams were conference rivals for 81 seasons in the Southwest Conference from 1915 through 1995.[citation needed] The University of Texas has had 129 Longhorns selected to the College Football All-America Team including 62 Consensus and 25 Unanimous; Texas also has 17 players and coaches that have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.[63] Major honors Offensive honors Coaching Honors Defensive honors Other honors As of 2016, the Texas Longhorns have had 570 All-Conference Player selections since 1915, including 292 in the Southwest Conference and 278 in the Big 12 where Longhorn players have been named 78 times to the first team and 65 to the second team.[64] 351 Longhorns have been drafted into the NFL, including 44 in the 1st round.[65]As of August 7, 2024[update], the Longhorns have 44 players active on NFL rosters.[66] Texas has had 22 players and three former coaches inducted into the Hall of Fame. Texas has had 5 players inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame. One former Longhorn was inducted as an NFL head coach. The 1893 team did not always wear orange. They also wore gold and white uniforms. In 1895, the Texas Athletic Association moved to orange and white colors. In 1897, the Association moved to orange and maroon to save cleaning costs. The Cactus Yearbook at the time listed the university colors as either gold or orange and white until the 1899 Cactus declared the university colors to be gold and maroon. Students at the university's medical branch in Galveston (UTMB) were in favor of royal blue. By 1899, a UT fan could have worn any of yellow, orange, white, red, maroon, or even blue.[67] The Board of Regents held an election in that year to decide the team colors. Students, faculty, staff and alumni were asked to vote. 1,111 votes were cast, with 562 in favor of orange and white. Orange and maroon received 310, royal blue 203, crimson 10, and royal blue and crimson 11. For the next 30 years, Longhorn teams wore bright orange on their uniforms, which faded to yellow by the end of the season. By the 1920s, other teams sometimes called the Longhorn squads \"yellow bellies,\" a term that didn't sit well with the athletic department. In 1928, UT football coach Clyde Littlefield ordered uniforms in a darker shade of orange that wouldn't fade, which would later become known as \"burnt orange\" or \"Texas orange.\" The dark-orange color was used until the dye became too expensive during the Great Depression, and the uniforms reverted to the bright orange for another two decades, until coach Darrell K Royal revived the burnt-orange color in the early 1960s.[67] For the 2009 Lone Star Showdown, the Longhorns wore a Nike Pro Combat uniform. From 1961 to 1962, the Longhorns' helmets featured the individual player's number on the side in burnt orange above the \"Bevo\" logo, which was also in burnt orange, with a large burnt-orange stripe down the middle of the helmet. The burnt-orange stripe was removed in 1963 and the helmet featured only the burnt-orange Bevo logo below the player's number, which was also in burnt orange. In 1967, the team abandoned the individual player's number above the logo, and moved the burnt-orange Bevo logo to the center of the helmet's side. With the exception of the 1969 season, this remained the team's helmet design until 1977. In 1969, the helmet design commemorated the 100th anniversary of the first college football game. The player's number was replaced by a large burnt-orange football above the Bevo logo. Inside the football was a white number \"100\" that indicated the anniversary year. The University of Texas is a tradition-rich school, and many of those traditions are associated with athletics events, especially football. Some Longhorn traditions include: The Texas football program joined the SEC in 2024. The conference expanded to 16 teams.[73] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.[74] Announced schedules as of June 25, 2023.[76][77] This is subject to change based on Texas' future move to the SEC. As part of the agreement allowing Texas and Oklahoma to move from the Big 12 to the SEC in 2024, instead of 2025, the sites of the home-and-home series with Michigan, originally scheduled to be at Texas in 2024, and at Michigan in 2027, were reversed, giving Fox the right to broadcast the 2024 game at Michigan.[78] Texas Football's recruiting department is led by Billy Glasscock.[79] Glasscock came from NC State in 2021 as director of player personnel, leading a team of staffers and interns in a combination of duties between recruiting and player personnel. On the recruiting side, Taylor Searels[80] directs everything from an events standpoint to accommodate recruiting visits. In player personnel, JM Jones and Austin Shelton[81] are assistant directors of player personnel, handling offense and defense respectively. They manage a team of recruiting assistants that all manage a position and report to their position coach. This recruiting assistant program has been a robust program that has seen the likes of Daniel Bernstein - EDGE, Julian Rowe-Cohen - TEs, Maxwell Solman - OL, Jacob De Santos - DB, Jake Warren - WR, and Tanner Martin - QBs come through. Their jobs were to identify recruits, evaluate them, and bring them to their position coaches if they are deemed worth watching and offering. These are the individuals that found most of the players on the team before anyone else.",

                "content": "Hawk tuah (/Àåh…îÀêk ÀàtuÀê…ô/ ‚ìò HAWK TOO-…ô)[a] is an internet meme originating from a viral YouTube video posted in 2024. During a street interview, Haliey Welch[2] used the catchphrase hawk tuah, an onomatopoeia for spitting or expectoration on a penis during oral sex, specifically, fellatio.[3][4][5] On June 11, 2024, a vox pop YouTube channel, Tim & Dee TV owned by Tim Dickerson and DeArius Marlow, released a video featuring an interview with Haliey Welch in the Broadway district of Nashville, Tennessee, United States.[6] Welch and another woman approached Dickerson and Marlow and asked to be interviewed.[6][7] The interview began with what Dickerson and Marlow considered tamer questions, such as, \"What makes you wifey material?\"[6][7] Eventually, Dickerson and Marlow stated, Welch encouraged Marlow to \"spice up the questions\".[6][7] Marlow responded by asking, \"What's one move in bed that makes a man go crazy every time?\" Welch's reply, in a thick Southern accent was, \"You gotta give 'em that 'hawk tuah' and spit on that thang\", referring to spitting on someone's penis during fellatio, ostensibly for lubricatory purposes.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][excessive citations] In December 2024, Hailey created a coin to trade her logo, but was sued for crypto-fraud.[11] The next day, Marlow uploaded the clip to TikTok and almost immediately other accounts across social media began reposting the video after scrubbing off the \"Tim and Dee TV\" watermark.[6] Dickerson and Marlow estimated that they filed at least fifty copyright claims in the days after they first published the clip.[6] The original video had gone viral, receiving millions of views across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, spawning remixes and remakes of the original audio, and gaining Welch the nickname Hawk Tuah Girl.[12] The video and the phrase turned into a meme.[13] Welch, who had been a minimum-wage worker at a factory, subsequently created an Instagram account and gained a sizable social media followership and media attention.[14] She also founded a company under which she registered various trademarks, gained representation by an agent,[13] and began selling merchandise themed on the phrase and making paid appearances.[14] On August 15, 2024, she threw the ceremonial first pitch of a New York Mets game,[15] and launched a podcast, Talk Tuah, under the Betr media company co-founded by Jake Paul.[16] Dickerson and Marlow indicated they were happy for Welch but were remiss for not receiving credit for Welch's fame.[6]",

                "content": "Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission Have you spent the past few weeks seeing posts about someone called ‚ÄúHawk Tuah Girl‚Äù and thinking to yourself, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be bothered with more information.‚Äù If so, you and I are in the same boat. Well, curiosity got the best of me when I saw that Ms. Tuah was reportedly signing with a talent agency. That rumor has since been walked back, but I had already seen the video and sort of figured out what was going on with the girl going viral for her fun sex tip. So now, I will pass that information on to you. Otherwise known as Haliey Welch, Hawk Tuah Girl is rising to prominence after being featured in a man-on-the-street interview from creators Tim & Dee TV. In the video, she‚Äôs asked ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one move in bed that makes a man go crazy every time?‚Äù Her response is what‚Äôs made her go viral. ‚ÄúYou gotta give ‚Äôem that ‚Äòhawk tuah‚Äô and spit on that thang,‚Äù she exclaimed. Words can‚Äôt really capture her whole vibe, so let‚Äôs run the tape. üòÇ #funny #fy #foryoupage #foryou #lol Do you get it now? ‚ÄúHawk tuah‚Äù is like, the sound of the guy in the back of an old Western saloon using a spittoon, but she‚Äôs talking about sex. It is funny. Whether or not it‚Äôs more than a week‚Äôs worth of virality levels of funny is up to you. Yeah. It might be helpful to conceptualize this as a PG-13 version of the ‚ÄúDamn, Daniel‚Äù moment. She said something funny, the internet is loving it, and people are quickly scrambling to figure out how to capitalize on it. There was even a rumor that she was going to sign with United Talent Agency, but TMZ is now reporting that no such deal is actually in the works. Someone should figure out something to do with this girl. She‚Äôs a good sport with a lot of charisma, which is like half the job of being famous. Might I interest you in a hat? Or maybe a T-shirt that reads, ‚ÄúIf she don‚Äôt hawk tuah, I don‚Äôt want to talk tuah‚Äù? Admittedly, that one is clever. Tim & Dee TV have created an official merch line to capitalize on their viral moment, but it‚Äôs unclear if Welch is getting a cut or not. (Unofficial ‚ÄúHawk Tuah ‚Äô24‚Äù merch was even spotted by one Cut staffer while on vacation in New Buffalo, Michigan.) Where Welch is definitely making her money is from the official Hawk Tuah hats. The trucker-style caps are produced by Jason Poteete, who owns an apparel company called Fathead Threads and has reportedly known Welch for years. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Poteete shared that the merch has been doing big business. They‚Äôve sold more than 2,000 hats already (the signed $50 version sold out quickly), and given the cheapest one is $32.78, the company must have brought in at least $65,000 on hats alone. Poteete wouldn‚Äôt say how much of that is going to Welch but said he wanted to make sure she saw some of the money being made off of her. ‚ÄúOf course she hasn‚Äôt gotten a dime from the first viral video that went out,‚Äù Poteete told the magazine. ‚ÄúNobody was asking permission for her to do nothing, neither. I just wanted her to get some profit off of this deal.‚Äù No, people are just trolling. Tippah County Tribune, a satirical social-media account, shared a post on Facebook in which they claimed that Welch (whom they identify as ‚ÄúHailey Wellington‚Äù) had lost her job as a preschool teacher at ‚ÄúEpstein Day School.‚Äù Their fake story included children ‚Äúspitting on each other and everything else‚Äù in the wake of the viral video. Welch later revealed that she actually worked at a spring factory in her hometown in Tennessee, and that she did not lose that job over this whole ordeal. (She quit once the video blew up.) Welch sat down for her first interview with Brianna Lapaglia of the Barstool Sports podcast Plan Bri. Lapaglia is dating country singer Zach Bryan, and interviewed Welch backstage at his concert. (Later in the evening, he brought Welch onstage to sing his hit ‚ÄúRevival‚Äù with him and she dutifully screamed ‚ÄúHawk tuah!‚Äù into the mic.) Welch told Lapaglia that she had been in Nashville for CMA Fest when she filmed her infamous clip and that she never expected to see the video again. She said that she saw it was going viral at around 2 a.m. while getting ready for work. ‚ÄúI shit a brick,‚Äù Welch said. As the video continued to gain traction, people began to make fake social-media accounts for the 21-year-old, who explained that she had deleted all her accounts six months ago for personal reasons. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kinda creepy, seeing your face on another account that don‚Äôt belong to you,‚Äù she said. Of course, people have been weird about this whole thing. Welch said that someone recently offered Poteete (the hat guy) $600 if he could get her to spit in a jar and mail it to him. While there are the errant pervs to deal with, Welch says she wants to use this as a springboard to a career. She has a manager and a team now, and says that her plan is to do ‚Äúa show, and we‚Äôre just gonna be on a bunch of podcasts and everything else in between.‚Äù No! People are actually being super-weird about her, which unfortunately is to be expected when you‚Äôre a cute girl who goes megaviral ‚Äî especially for answering a question about sex. The internet is filled with freaks and perverts, and they have all become obsessed with Welch and her newly coined phrase. A representative for PornHub told TMZ that the website was projecting 4.7 million searches for the term ‚Äúhawk tuah‚Äù by Tuesday. You have to imagine it would be easier to search for ‚Äúspitting,‚Äù right? Meanwhile, ‚Äúhawk tuah‚Äù has also become a political battleground. In her interview with Lapaglia, Welch declared that she would not give Donald Trump the ol‚Äô hawk tuah. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a no from me,‚Äù she said. BREAKING: The Hawk Tuah girl, AKA Hailey Welsh, has come out AGAINST Donald Trump in her first-ever interview: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a no from me,‚Äù she said.‚ÄúNo. Absolutely not,‚Äù said her friend. pic.twitter.com/8rxdTYys3m People whose brains have been poisoned by the internet interpreted this as Welch stating her politics. ‚ÄúThe degenerate Hawk Tuah girl, whose real name is Hailey Welsh, is ANTI TRUMP,‚Äù far-right political activist Laura Loomer posted on X. On the other side, a bizarre anonymous liberal account called Biden‚Äôs Wins declared that Welch had ‚Äúdemolished‚Äù Trump. Neither party seems to understand that Welch has not made a political statement; she simply does not want to engage in a sexual relationship with a 78-year-old man who always looks like he‚Äôs melting. As she told Lapaglia, she has a management team and they‚Äôre figuring out next steps for her. The Hollywood Reporter reported that Welch had signed with a management firm called The Penthouse. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad our team can help guide this rocket ship,‚Äù said The Penthouse founder Jonnie Forster in a statement. ‚ÄúAll the podcasters are right ‚Äî spend five minutes with her and you‚Äôll see why she is America‚Äôs sweetheart.‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure who ‚Äúall the podcasters‚Äù are, seeing as she‚Äôs only done one podcast. Welch, for her part, seems excited about this new venture. ‚ÄúTwo weeks ago, it was just my granny and me in itty-bitty Belfast, Tennessee. Then I say something silly and now my life has changed. Isn‚Äôt God great?! Can‚Äôt wait for what‚Äôs ahead,‚Äù Welch said in a statement. She has since hit the ground running. Welch returned to Instagram last week and quickly gained 1 million followers. Over the Fourth of July weekend, Welch made her first paid appearance at Daer Dayclub at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood, Florida. Welch shared a recap video of the event on Instagram, which included footage of her getting teary as a team of bottle girls celebrated her million-followers milestone. A post shared by Haliey Welch (@hay_welch) The next stop on her grand tour of the United States is New York, where she‚Äôll be making a club appearance this weekend. Do you think Andy Cohen has already put in a request for her to bartend on Watch What Happens Live? The internet darling took some time to sit down with Rolling Stone, which declared in the headline of the piece that Welch is ‚Äúthe national hero we need.‚Äù What anyone is ever talking about is beyond me. In the interview, Welch divulged a few personal details. She was raised by her paternal grandmother; her mother has never been in her life; and while she loves animals, she stays away from adopting cats because ‚Äúthey always run away ‚Äî or get run over.‚Äù She clarified what she meant when she said she wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúhawk tuah‚Äù Trump, saying, ‚ÄúI was talking about looks-wise. Donald Trump, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a nice man, but you ain‚Äôt getting the hawk from me. He‚Äôs old enough to be my granddaddy.‚Äù It still seems as though neither Welch nor her management team know exactly what her next step is going to be. She told the magazine that she likes the idea of podcasting and wants to be in a vaguely comedic space. She has a publicist now, and when she was told she‚Äôs repped by the same firm that handles Bruce Springsteen‚Äôs publicity, she said, ‚ÄúWho is that?‚Äù Now, take a deep breath and repeat after me: It‚Äôs okay that a 21-year-old from a town of 700 people doesn‚Äôt know who Bruce Springsteen is. Welch is launching her podcast, creatively titled Talk Tuah, later this month through Jake Paul‚Äôs media company, Betr. In a press release, the company announced that Welch‚Äôs first guest would be Whitney Cummings, followed by content creator Josh Richards, and then Paul himself. The show, according to Betr, will ‚Äúblend insightful interviews with comedic elements.‚Äù Thank God someone is finally bringing that to the podcasting space. ‚ÄúMy show will have a little of everything ‚Äî great guests, laughs, chit chats about your pets, relationship pointers, sports and, of course, some down home southern charm,‚Äù Welch said in a statement.

ICYMI, another new word has made its way online ‚Äî and into my brain ‚Äî and it was introduced by none other than Haliey Welch, aka Hawk Tuah Girl. Want to know what the word is?

The highlight of this episode was when Welch explained what a ‚Äúshirtussy‚Äù is and, let me tell you, it‚Äôs pretty interesting. At the 9:39 mark of the podcast, Welch explained a ‚Äúshirtussy‚Äù as ‚Äúwhen you have a fat cooter and your cooter decides to take a bite out of your shirt.‚Äù Welch even went as far to say a shirtussy is ‚Äúbetter than a camel toe,‚Äù but her friends didn‚Äôt necessarily agree. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically the same thing,‚Äù Welch‚Äôs one friend said. ‚ÄúI think [shirtussy is] worse.‚Äù Welch‚Äôs other friends laughed off the joke, and one even said that she would rather have a camel toe!

                "content": "The Indiana Hoosiers football program represents Indiana University Bloomington in NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision college football and in the Big Ten Conference. The Hoosiers have played their home games at Memorial Stadium since 1960. The team has won the Big Ten Championship twice, once in 1945 and again in 1967. The Hoosiers have appeared in 12 bowl games, including the 1968 Rose Bowl. Six Indiana players have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, including Zora Clevinger, Bill Ingram, Pete Pihos, George Taliaferro, John Tavener, and Anthony Thompson, who was also National Player of the Year in 1989. The Hoosiers are currently led by head coach Curt Cignetti. Indiana University has the most losses of any Division I (FBS or FCS) football program (714),[3] and also the fourth worst winning percentage of any FBS team with over 1,000 games played (.421).[4] No coach since 1948 has left with a winning record.[5] In the fall of 1884 the Indiana student newspaper made its first reference to football by reporting that a team was being organized.[6] The following year, in 1885, a Yale graduate, professor Arthur B. Woodford, came to Indiana to teach political and social science and during the next year he introduced football to the school.[6] Woodford coached the Hoosiers from 1887 to 1888.[6] In the only documented game of the 1889 season, Indiana lost to Wabash College, 40‚Äì2. Evan Wollen led the Hoosiers to an 0‚Äì1 record.[7] By 1891 Billy Herod was head coach.[6] He had never played football but had seen it played in the East.[6] The Hoosiers continued to struggle to find wins, even forfeiting a game to in-state rival Purdue in the 1894 season.[6] The first winning season came in 1895 under coach Dana Osgood, who led the team to a 4‚Äì3‚Äì1 record.[6] This was followed by two winning seasons in 1896 and 1897 under coach Madison G. Gonterman,[6] who was hired away from Harvard.[8] After coaching the Hoosiers to winning records in 1898 and 1899, coach James H. Horne and the football team joined the Western Conference (later the Big Ten Conference).[9] Horne led Indiana to six .500-or-better records in his seven years.[10] In 1905 coach James M. Sheldon took over and would have the longest tenure of a football coach at Indiana until Bo McMillin coached for 14 years (1934‚Äì1947).[6][11] Sheldon proved to be one of the most successful coaches in Indiana football's early years, leading the Hoosiers to four winning seasons and as high as third in the Big Ten Conference rankings.[6][11] In 1914 Indiana hired its first full-time coach, Clarence Childs,[6] but continued to struggle to find success.[12] In 1922 construction began on the original Memorial Stadium.[13] It would seat 22,000 fans and $250,000 was raised to erect the new facility.[13] The new stadium was built on the grounds of the golf course and replaced Jordan Field, which had been the home of Indiana football since 1887.[13] Bo McMillin is the only head coach to lead Indiana football to an outright Big Ten Championship.[6] In 1945, the Hoosiers achieved their only unbeaten season (9‚Äì0‚Äì1).[6] The achievement earned Coach McMillan the title of Man of the Year (by the Football Writers Association) and Coach of the Year (by the Football Coaches Association).[14] Part of the team's success in this period is attributable to George Taliaferro, an African-American who helped break down color barriers in sports and played for the Hoosiers two years before Jackie Robinson suited up for the Brooklyn Dodgers.[15] A three-time All-American, Taliaferro led the Hoosiers in rushing twice, punting in 1945 and passing in 1948.[15] He helped lead the 1945 undefeated team.[15] Under Coach McMillin, IU had 10 winning seasons, including a stretch of six consecutive years.[14] His Big Ten record of 34‚Äì34‚Äì6 is the best of any Indiana coach, as is his overall winning percentage (.562).[6] His overall record at IU is 63‚Äì48‚Äì11.[14] On September 23, 1946, McMillin was named Indiana's athletic director.[16] Clyde Smith left Wisconsin La-Crosse and came to the Hoosiers as head football coach following McMillin's retirement.[6] The Hoosiers struggled mightily under Smith, as they failed to win more than three games in a single season with Smith at the helm.[17] Smith's final record at IU is 8‚Äì27‚Äì1.[17] Bernie Crimmins came to Indiana from his post as an assistant under legendary coach Frank Leahy at Notre Dame and brought along high hopes that IU football prominence would be restored.[6] However, it didn't happen. Like his predecessor, Crimmins failed to win more than three games in a single season, with yearly records of 2‚Äì7, 2‚Äì7, 3‚Äì6, 3‚Äì6 and 3‚Äì6 for a final record of 13‚Äì32 in five seasons.[6][18] Crimmins was fired as head coach and returned to Notre Dame as an assistant.[19] Bob Hicks came to Indiana from his post as an assistant at Wyoming.[6] He took over the Hoosiers football program for one season while Phil Dickens was being investigated for alleged NCAA violations.[6] He went 1‚Äì8 in his only season as head coach, failing to win a single Big Ten game.[6][20] He returned to his post as assistant coach for the Hoosiers after Dickens was reinstated.[6] Coach Phil Dickens, formerly head football coach at Wyoming, guided Indiana to a fifth-place finish in the Big Ten and a 3‚Äì2‚Äì1 overall record in 1958, his first season at the helm (he sat out the 1957 season while under investigation by the NCAA).[6][21] That same year construction began on the new Memorial Stadium, which is still the home of the football team today.[13] In the fall of 1960 the Indiana football program was hit with devastating NCAA sanctions.[22] The sanctions resulted from violations that included the offering of free plane tickets to several athletes along with financial stipends, according to an NCAA report, while other recruits were delivered envelopes filled with cash.[22][23] Indiana denied the charges, arguing that possible recruiting violations were just the work of overzealous alumni.[22] The NCAA, however, didn't buy the claims and saddled Indiana with four years of probation.[22] During this time all Hoosier varsity sports were barred from postseason play.[22][23] The NCAA also disallowed any Indiana win during the 1960 Big Ten season because of Indiana's improper recruiting practices.[22] The sanctions were a stain on Indiana's notoriously clean record and undermined the ability to convince talented athletes to come to Bloomington.[22] However, Dickens was not held responsible for the sanctions and remained on the Hoosier sidelines for another five years until 1964.[21][24] Dickens' contract was not renewed after seven seasons.[25] John Pont, who came to IU from Yale, took over just as the IU sanctions expired.[6][26] In 1966 the team achieved only a 1‚Äì8‚Äì1 record.[27] But the following season, in 1967, Indiana surprisingly had a 9‚Äì2 record and shared the Big Ten title with Minnesota and Purdue.[27] The team was invited to and accepted the invitation play in the 1968 Rose Bowl (Indiana's only appearance), but lost to Southern California,[26][27][28] the team which would be named national champions. Pont was named unanimous national coach of the year and head coach of the East team in the 1968 Coaches All-America game.[27] With sophomore stars Harry Gonzo, John Isenbarger and Jade Butcher returning for two more years, the Hoosiers were ranked in the preseason top 10 nationally in 1968. Unfortunately, due to injuries and to the return to prominence of programs at Ohio State, Michigan and Purdue, the Hoosiers finished 6‚Äì4 in 1968 and 4‚Äì6 in 1969 (also partially due to a 14-player African American team boycott).[27] Pont, after only winning five or more games in a single season twice after the Rose Bowl season (never more than six wins),[27] was asked to resign after eight seasons.[29] Lee Corso left Louisville and took over as IU head football coach in 1973,[30] leading the Hoosiers to two winning seasons in 1979 and 1980.[6] The 1979 regular season ended with 7‚Äì4 record and earned a trip to the 1979 Holiday Bowl;[6] there the Hoosiers would beat the previously unbeaten BYU.[6] Indiana's victory over the Cougars propelled the team to 16th in the UPI poll, the Hoosiers' first top-20 ranking since 1967.[6] During one game in the 1976 season, Corso called a time out after his team scored a touchdown early in the 2nd quarter.[31] The entire team huddled together for a photograph with the scoreboard filling the background.[31] It read: Indiana 7, Ohio State 6.[31] It was the first time in 25 years that the Hoosiers had led the Buckeyes in a football game.[32] Corso's record was 41‚Äì68‚Äì2 over his ten years at Indiana.[33] Corso was fired after ten seasons in which, other than the Holiday Bowl season, the Hoosiers only had one winning season, a 6‚Äì5 1980 season.[33][34] For one season, Sam Wyche, formerly an assistant with the NFL's San Francisco 49ers, led the Indiana Hoosiers football program.[35] Wyche's Hoosiers struggled to a 3‚Äì8 record in his only season at the helm of the Hoosiers.[35] He left IU to accept an offer to become head coach of the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals.[36] Bill Mallory, who came to IU from Northern Illinois, took over as head football coach following Wyche's departure.[6] Although he finished with a winless 0‚Äì11 record during his first campaign at Indiana in 1984,[37] it would take Mallory just three seasons to lead the Hoosiers to their first bowl appearance under his direction.[37] Indiana finished with a 6‚Äì5 regular-season record in 1986 and capped its season by playing a talented Florida State team in the 1986 All-American Bowl on New Year's Eve.[37] Despite losing 27‚Äì13, the Hoosiers put up a good fight. Indiana running back Anthony Thompson, who was playing in his first bowl game, finished with 127 rushing yards on 28 carries.[38] In 1987, Mallory became the first Big Ten coach to be awarded back-to-back coach of the year honors after the Hoosiers earned an 8‚Äì4 record (with wins over Ohio State and Michigan), a second-place finish in the Big Ten, and a Peach Bowl appearance against Tennessee.[39] In what was the first-ever meeting between the schools, Tennessee was victorious by a final score of 27‚Äì22. In 1988, Indiana finished the regular season with a 7‚Äì3‚Äì1 record, a 5‚Äì3 mark in the Big Ten, and a top-20 ranking.[37] It earned the team a postseason berth for the third consecutive year with a game against South Carolina in the 1988 Liberty Bowl.[40] The Hoosiers dominated the game and cruised to a 34‚Äì10 victory before 39,210 fans.[40] Indiana set a Liberty Bowl record with 575 yards of total offense.[40] Indiana finished with a 6‚Äì4‚Äì1 regular-season record in 1990, a mark good enough to earn the Hoosiers a berth in the Peach Bowl for a game against the Auburn Tigers, which Indiana would lose 27‚Äì23.[41] Part of Indiana's success can be attributed to star running back Vaughn Dunbar.[42] In 1991 Indiana played in the Copper Bowl and dominated a highly regarded Baylor team 24‚Äì0.[43] Led by future NFL quarterback Trent Green, it was one of the most impressive performances by any team during the 1991 bowl season. Indiana finished the 1993 season with an 8‚Äì4 record, with two of its three regular season losses by seven points or less.[37][44] The team went on to play in the 1993 Independence Bowl.[37] Coach Mallory, despite his successes, was fired after thirteen seasons, ending his career at Indiana with six bowl games overall in 13 seasons.[39] He is Indiana's all-time winningest head football coach with 69 wins.[39] Washington Redskins quarterbacks coach and Indiana alumnus Cam Cameron began coaching the Hoosiers in 1997 and in five seasons compiled a record of 18‚Äì37.[45] Cameron brought a new system and logo to the school, both in style and in substance.[6] Cameron began by introducing a new oval logo for the football helmets (which has since been discarded).[6] Cameron brought an explosive offense to school with highly effective offensive players such as Antwaan Randle El.[46] Indiana averaged 23.6 points per game under Cameron's guidance.[6] In fact, Randle El became the first player in NCAA Division I history to pass for 40 career touchdowns and score 40 career rushing touchdowns. He finished his college career as fifth on the all-time NCAA total yardage list, and became the first player in college football history to record 2,500 total yards for each of four consecutive years.[47] Although Cameron's Indiana teams won less than one-third of their games, Indiana was recognized by the American Football Coaches Association for its exemplary football graduation rates in each of Cameron's final four seasons. Nevertheless, Cameron was fired after the 2001 season.[48][49] In 2002, former Vanderbilt and LSU head football coach Gerry DiNardo took over as Indiana head football coach. The Hoosiers posted a 3‚Äì9 overall record. They went 1‚Äì7 in Big Ten Conference play, ending up tied for last with Northwestern.[50] Dinardo's Hoosiers also struggled during the 2003 season, registering a slightly worse standing than 2002. The Hoosiers turned in a 2‚Äì10 overall record with a 1‚Äì7 conference standing, good for second to last in the Big Ten.[51] Coach Dinardo later remarked that his players needed to be better organized in the offseason. Additionally, despite the losing record, that \"the 2003 Hoosiers were probably the closest team he's been around\".[52] Indiana didn't fare any better under DiNardo's tutelage in 2004. The Hoosiers ended up 3‚Äì8 overall, posting another 1‚Äì7 Big Ten standing that left them tied for last with Illinois.[53] At the conclusion of the 2004 season, DiNardo's fate was sealed. He finished with just an 8‚Äì27 overall record.[54][55] He never won more than three games in a season,[56] and was fired after the 2004 season.[57][58] In 2005 Terry Hoeppner (\"Coach Hep\") left Miami (OH) and was named head coach of the Hoosiers.[59] He quickly made an impact by nearly leading the team to a bowl appearance in 2006. With 49 true or redshirt freshmen and 72 underclassmen overall, that team was the youngest team in the Big Ten.[59] Despite such youth, the team garnered five victories, the most since the 2001 season.[60] The 2006 Hoosiers picked up three Big Ten wins for the first time since 2001.[60] Coach Hep rejuvenated the Indiana fan base; attendance increased 39 percent, season ticket sales increased 46 percent, and student season ticket sales increased 110 percent. In 2006, Hoeppner announced he was taking a medical leave of absence but died shortly afterward following a lengthy battle with brain cancer.[59] Hoeppner's final record at IU was 9‚Äì14.[60] In 2007, Hoeppner's offensive coordinator Bill Lynch, a native Hoosier, took over the reins of the program.[61] In his first season Lynch led Indiana to a 7‚Äì6 record (the most wins since 1993) and its first Old Oaken Bucket victory since 2001.[62] The success earned the team a trip to the Insight Bowl.[62] The season marked the first time that an Indiana coach guided a team to a bowl game in his first season. The 2008 Indiana team was hampered by a number of injuries.[63] Against Wisconsin, the Hoosiers were forced to play three quarterbacks and four centers.[63] 13 starters in total were injured during the year. Still, Lynch was able to pull in one of the strongest recruiting classes in recent history. 2009 showed marked improvement on the field, although the record ledger failed to show it as the team took 4th quarter leads into three Big Ten road games before falling short.[63] During Lynch's tenure, the players established a Player's Leadership Council, which elect weekly game captains and select the community service organizations the team volunteers with.[63] The Boys and Girls Club of Bloomington and Riley Children's Hospital of Indianapolis are two favorite causes of the team. Lynch's tenure has been noted for his strong recruiting and identifying and developing high character young men who want to be part of a family atmosphere.[63] However, after four seasons, Lynch compiled just a 19‚Äì30 overall record[62] and was fired by athletic director Fred Glass.[63] On December 7, 2010, Oklahoma offensive coordinator Kevin Wilson was named head coach of the Hoosiers.[64] Despite no prior college head coaching experience, Wilson arrived in Bloomington with ties to the Midwestern United States from his years as an assistant coach at Miami (OH) and Northwestern under Randy Walker.[65] Additionally, Wilson had a reputation as a brilliant offensive mind, having overseen explosive offenses during his years with the Sooners that set school records.[66] Wilson, who won the 2008 Broyles Award as the nation's top assistant coach,[67][68][69] also helped coach and develop Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Sam Bradford during his time with the Sooners.[70][71][72] When he was hired by IU, Wilson signed a seven-year contract worth $1.2 million annually excluding incentives.[73] When he arrived, Wilson installed a spread offense identical to the system he ran at Oklahoma.[74] In Wilson's first year, the Hoosiers compiled a 1‚Äì11 record.[75] In his second year, Indiana improved to 4‚Äì8 on the year (4 losses were by seven points or fewer),[76][77] but surpassed Northwestern's record for most losses in Football Bowl Subdivision history.[78] Nevertheless, Wilson's team exhibited an explosive offense, going from 80th nationally in pass offense to 19th and leading the Big Ten with 311.2 yards per game, in spite of losing the starting quarterback Tre Roberson in the season's second game.[79][80] Additionally, Wilson was successful in luring five 4-star Rivals.com recruits from the 2013 class to Indiana, the most in school history. Wilson's 2013 team improved to 5‚Äì7,[76] and while the Hoosiers featured one of the Big Ten's more potent offenses (ranked 2nd in the Big Ten for 2013), the team's defense was among the conference's worst (12th in the Big Ten). The Hoosiers set school and Big Ten records for most yards and points allowed per game, and the Hoosiers lost three games in which they scored at least 35 points. Wilson fired defensive coordinator Doug Mallory following the 2013 season[81] and replaced him with Brian Knorr, the former defensive coordinator of Wake Forest and former head coach at Ohio.[82][83] After going 6‚Äì6 overall (2‚Äì6 B1G) in the 2015 season, Wilson's Hoosiers would qualify for a bowl game, the first since 2007.[84] The Hoosiers would eventually lose the Pinstripe Bowl to Duke by a score of 44‚Äì41 in overtime.[85] Following the 2015 post season, on January 16, 2016, Wilson hired Tom Allen, the former defensive coordinator of USF, to replace Knorr beginning the 2016 season.[86][87] On January 11, 2016, IU and Kevin Wilson agreed to terms on a six-year contract extension and raise.[88] Following the end of the 2016 regular season, the Hoosiers would again finish 6‚Äì6 overall (4‚Äì5 B1G) to become bowl eligible for the second year in a row.[89] This was the first time since 1990‚Äì1991 that the Hoosiers have gone to back-to-back bowl games. However, Wilson resigned as head coach on December 1, 2016, amidst \"philosophical differences\" with athletic director Fred Glass and allegations of player mistreatment.[90][91][92][93] He later went on to be the offensive coordinator for the Ohio State Buckeyes football program, under head coach Urban Meyer.[94] Despite failing to achieve a winning record in six seasons with the Hoosiers, Wilson led IU to two bowl game appearances and oversaw explosive offenses that set IU school records.[95][96] In Wilson's last 5 seasons as head coach for the Indiana Hoosiers, his offenses led the Big Ten Conference in passing yards per game (226.7 yards), were second in total yards per game (459.3 yards), third in points per game (31.4 points), and fourth in rushing yards per game (192.7 yards).[97][98][99] On December 1, 2016, Hoosiers defensive coordinator Tom Allen was promoted to head coach, replacing Kevin Wilson.[100][101][102] On December 7, the IU football team was invited to play in the Foster Farms Bowl on December 28, 2016, at Levi's Stadium against the Utah Utes.[103] The bowl game served as Tom Allen's head coaching debut. On January 4, 2017, former Tennessee offensive coordinator Mike DeBord was hired to the same position for the Hoosiers.[104] On August 3, 2017, ESPN's College GameDay announced that it will hold its first show of the season in Bloomington, the first time it has been held in that city.[105] On September 9, 2017, Allen would record his first win as the head coach of the Hoosiers, defeating the Virginia Cavaliers, in Charlottesville, by a score of 34‚Äì17.[106] Following the loss at Purdue on November 25, 2017, Allen and the Hoosiers would finish the 2017 season 5‚Äì7 overall and fail to earn a bowl appearance.[107] After the culmination of the 2018 season for Indiana, Allen's Hoosiers would again finish the season 5‚Äì7 overall; Indiana failed to beat archrival Purdue in a must-win, last game of the season, to become bowl eligible.[108] The loss to the Boilermakers would secure the Hoosiers' second-straight year without a bowl appearance. On December 27, 2018, the Hoosiers announced the promotion of Kane Wommack from linebackers coach to defensive coordinator.[109] On December 30, 2018, Hoosiers' offensive coordinator Mike DeBord announced his retirement from football.[110][111] On January 21, 2019, former Fresno State offensive coordinator Kalen DeBoer was announced as the Hoosiers' new offensive coordinator.[112] The Hoosiers would finish the 2019 regular season with an 8‚Äì4 overall record (5‚Äì4 Big Ten) and become bowl eligible by October 26; the 8‚Äì4 overall season record had not been accomplished since Indiana's 1993 season. On November 30, 2019, the Hoosiers defeated in-state rival Purdue 44‚Äì41, in two overtimes, to win the Old Oaken Bucket for the first time since 2016. On December 8, 2019, Indiana was selected as a participant in the 2020 Gator Bowl against Tennessee; the Hoosiers would go on to lose 22‚Äì23 to the Volunteers.[113] Following the culmination of the regular season, both Allen and DeBoer would receive watchlist nominations for their respective Coach of the Year awards, including DeBoer being named a semifinalist for the Broyles Award. On December 17, 2019, Kalen DeBoer was hired by Fresno State as its newest head coach; DeBoer had served only one year as the Hoosiers' offensive coordinator.[114] Following the departure of DeBoer to Fresno State, Indiana announced the promotion of tight ends' coach Nick Sheridan to offensive coordinator and running backs' coach Mike Hart to associate head coach.[115] On December 6, 2019, Tom Allen received a new seven-year contract worth $3.9 million annually excluding incentives.[116] Indiana's first game of the 2020 season took place at Memorial Stadium on October 24, 2020, against the No. 8 Penn State Nittany Lions. The Hoosiers defeated Penn State 36‚Äì35 in overtime.[117] The Hoosiers were awarded a ranking of No. 17 following the victory.[118] Indiana's next two games included a 37‚Äì21 victory over the Rutgers Scarlet Knights and a 38‚Äì21 victory over the No. 23 Michigan Wolverines, their first victory over them in 33 years.[119] Following the win versus the Wolverines, the Hoosiers were ranked tenth in both the AP and coaches poll, their highest rankings since 1969 and 1992.[120] Following the culmination of the regular season, the Hoosiers would be invited to the Outback Bowl, where they would lose by six points to Ole Miss, 26‚Äì20.[121] After the season concluded, defensive coordinator Kane Wommack would leave to become head coach of the South Alabama Jaguars. Indiana would hire Charlton Warren from the Georgia Bulldogs to replace him. On March 8, 2021, IU and Tom Allen agreed to terms on another new seven-year contract that came with a $1 million annual raise.[122] The new deal made Allen the 18th highest paid head college football coach in the country.[123] Following a 2‚Äì10 overall (0‚Äì9 Big Ten) finish of the 2021 season, Indiana fired offensive coordinator Nick Sheridan on November 28, 2021.[124] The Hoosiers hired former UMass head coach Walt Bell as Sheridan's replacement on December 9, 2021.[125][126] The Hoosiers finished the 2022 season 4‚Äì8 overall (2‚Äì7 Big Ten), ending up second to last in the Big Ten East, just ahead of Rutgers.[127] Indiana continued to languish under Allen in its 2023 campaign. On September 23, 2023, Indiana barely eked out a 29‚Äì27 victory in 4 overtimes over the Akron Zips, themselves a struggling team that finished its season 2‚Äì10 overall. [128][129] The Hoosiers wound up 3‚Äì9 overall (1‚Äì8 Big Ten), good for last in the Big Ten East and the worst all around Big Ten record.[130] On November 26, 2023, IU fired Tom Allen as head coach after three straight losing seasons.[131] This was a day after the Hoosiers concluded the 2023 season with a 3‚Äì9 record, its third consecutive losing season.[132] After the solid 2020 season, Allen was unable to sustain the momentum generated during that season and the Hoosiers struggled on the football field thereafter.[133] Allen and IU agreed to a reduced $15.5 million buyout when Allen was terminated, the most money the Hoosiers have ever paid a fired football coach in its history and the fourth largest buyout paid in college football history.[134][135] On November 30, 2023, Indiana athletics director Scott Dolson announced the hiring of James Madison head coach Curt Cignetti as the next Hoosiers head coach.[136] The 62-year-old Cignetti arrived in Bloomington with impressive credentials, never having a single losing season in 13 years as a head coach at JMU, Elon and IUP.[137] He also oversaw the Dukes' successful transition from the FCS to the FBS and served as wide receivers coach and recruiting coordinator at Alabama under Nick Saban from 2007 to 2010, playing a significant role in the recruitment of many of the Crimson Tide's key players as well as coaching and developing star wide receiver Julio Jones and others.[138][139] When hired, Cignetti signed a six-year contract with IU that pays about $27 million excluding incentives over the course of the deal.[140][141] In his first season in 2024, Cignetti guided the Hoosiers to their first 8‚Äì0 start since 1967,[142] then to their first 9‚Äì0 start in school history,[143] and then to their first 10‚Äì0 start in school program history and also their first ever 10 win season in program history.[144] On November 16, 2024, the university administration and Cignetti agreed to a new eight-year contract worth $72 million excluding incentives.[145] Indiana has won two conference championships, one outright and one shared. ‚Ä† Co-champion Indiana has participated in 13 bowl games in 120 seasons, garnering a record of 3‚Äì10 through the 2020 season.[146] An oft-spoken mantra, coined after Terry Hoeppner's death prior to the 2007 season, is to \"play 13,\" meaning to play an extra game (a bowl game) after the 12-game regular season. Created in 1887, Indiana's first athletic grounds, Jordan Field was originally named University Athletic Field before being renamed in 1898, in honor of then-Indiana University President David Starr Jordan. The field was a mixed-use facility utilized by both the football and baseball teams. Bleacher seating for 4,000 persons were added in 1901, with field drainage added the following year to alleviate flooding. In 1904, a track and field component was added to the athletic facility; however, conditions of the field continued to be a problem for the Hoosiers. The track and field portion of Jordan Field was upgraded in 1915. A proposed stadium, north of the current facility, was planned by the university; however, the outbreak of World War I postponed construction. The football and baseball teams would continue play at Jordan Field through the end of 1923. The proposed stadium would begin construction in 1924 and would open in the fall of 1925. The final varsity athletic event for Jordan Field, a baseball game, would occur in 1950 prior to the facility being turned into a parking lot for the nearby Indiana Memorial Union.[147] Indiana's two Memorial Stadiums are entirely distinct venues and share only the same name, though never at the same time. The current Memorial Stadium was called Seventeenth Street Football Stadium until 1971, when it was renamed Memorial Stadium and the original stadium was renamed Tenth Street Stadium. Tenth Street Stadium hosted the Little 500 bicycle race until Bill Armstrong Stadium was built in 1981. It was demolished in the same year and its former place on campus is occupied by the arboretum. Shortly before its demolition, the old stadium was featured in the 1979 cult movie classic Breaking Away ‚Äì filmed primarily on the Indiana campus and the surrounding Bloomington, Indiana area.[148] The current iteration of Memorial Stadium opened in 1960 as part of a new athletics area at the university and has a capacity of 52,656. It replaced the original Memorial Stadium, built in 1925, a 20,000-seat stadium located on 10th Street where the arboretum now stands. The stadium has been expanded twice since the original construction. The $38 million, 138,000-square-foot, North End Zone Student-Athlete Development Center opened in 2009. The $53 million, 66,575-square-foot, South End Zone Student-Athlete Excellence Center opened in 2018. The John Mellencamp Pavilion is the primary indoor athletics training facility of the Indiana Hoosiers's football program. It was dedicated on April 12, 1996, following a donation of $1.5 million from singer-songwriter John Mellencamp, to facilitate the project. The indoor practice facility contains a regulation-sized football field, featuring a Sportexe Momentum 41 artificial surface which was installed in 2007.[149] While not as intense as the men's basketball rivalry between the schools, the football rivalry between Illinois and Indiana dates back to 1899 and has been played 73 times.[150][151] When the Big Ten split into non-geographical divisions in 2011,[152] both the Fighting Illini and Hoosiers were placed in the \"Leaders\" division, thereby ensuring an annual meeting on the football field.[153] However, when the Big Ten opted for a divisional format based on geography three years later,[154] Illinois was placed in the \"West\" division with Indiana placed in the \"East\", making the series intermittent once again.[155] Illinois leads the all-time series 46‚Äì25‚Äì2.[156] The Hoosiers have a nonconference rivalry with bordering-state opponent Kentucky that is most prominent in men's basketball but also extends to football as well.[157] The Hoosiers played the Wildcats annually from 1987 until 2005 in what was known as the \"Bourbon Barrel\" game.[158][159] The two teams played for a trophy called the \"Bourbon Barrel\" from 1987 until both schools mutually agreed to retire the trophy in 1999 following the alcohol-related death of a Kentucky football player.[160] The two teams last met on September 17, 2005, with Indiana winning 38‚Äì14; Indiana leads the overall series (18‚Äì17‚Äì1).[161] As of July 2024, there are no future plans for the schools to meet on the football field. Indiana has a football trophy game (for the Old Brass Spittoon) against bordering-state opponent Michigan State.[162][163] The Spartans were Indiana's dedicated cross-divisional rival in the Big Ten during the era of the Legends and Leaders divisions (2011‚Äì2013).[153][164] From 2014 to 2023, the Hoosiers and Spartans were in the Big Ten East division and played each other annually.[154][165] Michigan State leads the all-time series 50‚Äì18‚Äì2.[166][167] The football series between Indiana and bordering-state opponent Ohio State dates back to 1901 and has been played 97 times.[168] Both schools have been longtime members of the Big Ten Conference with the Hoosiers joining in 1899 and the Buckeyes following suit in 1912.[169] The series has been dominated by Ohio State, who lead the all-time series 80‚Äì12‚Äì5.[170][171] The Buckeyes held a 23-game winning streak in the rivalry between 1960 and 1986 and currently hold a 28-game winning streak over the Hoosiers dating back to 1991, which is the longest active winning streak in NCAA Division I FBS for one team over another.[172][173] There was a brief period in the late 1980s where Indiana upset Ohio State in consecutive meetings then tied the Buckeyes in 1990.[174] Then-Buckeyes head coach Earle Bruce called Indiana's 1987 win over the Buckeyes \"the darkest day in Ohio State football history\".[175][176][177] When the Big Ten first split into non-geographical divisions in 2011, both the Hoosiers and Buckeyes were placed in the league's \"Leaders\" division which ensured an annual meeting on the football field.[153] Three years later, when the Big Ten scrapped that divisional format in favor of a format based on geography, both schools were placed in the league's East division, once again ensuring an annual meeting.[165][178] The series will become intermittent starting in 2024 when divisions are abolished and the conference expands to 18 schools. Ohio State is Indiana's second most-played opponent all-time behind only Purdue[179] while Indiana is Ohio State's third behind Michigan and Illinois.[180][181][182][183] Legendary former Ohio State head coach Woody Hayes had a particular disdain for Indiana.[174] After losing to the Hoosiers in his first year coaching the Buckeyes in 1951, Hayes was so bitterly dismayed and appalled by his team's performance in that game that he publicly vowed any Buckeyes team he coached from that point forward would never again lose to the Hoosiers.[175][184] Hayes stayed true to his word, going 22‚Äì0‚Äì1 against Indiana between 1952 and 1978, his final season at Ohio State.[185][186] Indiana's biggest, oldest and most prominent rivalry is with in-state opponent Purdue.[187] The teams compete for the Old Oaken Bucket, most recently held by Indiana after defeating the Boilermakers during the 2019 season. Purdue leads the series 77‚Äì42‚Äì6 through the 2021 season.[188] When the Big Ten split into geographical divisions in 2014,[165][189] the Hoosiers and Boilermakers were placed in opposite divisions but the conference protected this rivalry as an annual contest.[190][191] The series was designated as a protected rivalry when the conference expanded to 18 schools in 2024. The Hoosier football program has the most all-time losses (713 as of the 2023 season)[192] in the history of NCAA Division I (now FBS) football, in addition to the ninth worst all-time winning percentage (.423) out of 128 FBS schools (Division I teams with over 1000 games played). Fellow Big Ten program Northwestern is ranked 2nd in all time losses with 677, and Purdue is ranked 29th with 579 losses.

Players Coach Players Coach Records from the 1956 season through the 2018 season.[citation needed] The Indiana football team has primarily worn a home uniform of red jerseys (usually a variation of crimson red) with either red or white pants for most of the program's history. There have also been different designs incorporated into the main jerseys and pants, which have largely utilized the Block-I logo or interlocking-IU logo,[196] striping and different variations and placement on the words 'Indiana' or 'Hoosier'. For away games the Hoosiers utilize white jerseys with white pants. Notable exceptions have also included the use of red-on-red color combinations for the jersey and pants, as well as white jerseys with red pants.[197][198] While the Hoosiers do not have designated alternate uniforms, there have been times when the uniforms were altered from their traditional design. During the Cam Cameron era (1997‚Äì2001), the jerseys and Block-I logo were changed to a red, black and white color scheme, while also incorporating an original design for the traditional IU athletics logo; the design and color combination were reverted to the interlocking-IU logo and official colors of Indiana following the departure of Cameron.[6] For the 2018 season, the rear name-plate on the jerseys were not included to keep the uniforms standardized to Indiana's tradition of \"honoring \"Team Over Self\" by not including the players' names on backs of jerseys in any sport\"; however, the rear name-plate was added back to the jersey beginning in the 2019 season.[199] Indiana has historically used a variation of its red and white scheme in its helmet design. These designs have included, but are not limited to: placing the Block-I logo on either side of the helmet (as well as on the front of the helmet - 1959-1961),[200] an all red or all white helmet, the inclusion of the aforementioned redesigned IU logo from the Cam Cameron era (1997-2001),[200] the use of the Indiana State Flag logo on one side of the helmet,[201] as well as an alternating red and chrome-striped helmet.[202] Additionally, striping on the helmet have also been included on the varied designs. Announced schedules as of November 30, 2023.[208]",
