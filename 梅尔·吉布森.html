                <h2 class="article-title">Mel Gibson - Wikipedia</h2>
                <p class="article-content">Mel Gibson is a prominent American actor and filmmaker, born on January 3, 1956, in Peekskill, New York. He gained fame for his roles in action films, particularly as Max Rockatansky in the "Mad Max" series and Martin Riggs in the "Lethal Weapon" series. Gibson's career began in Australia after moving there at the age of 12, where he studied at the National Institute of Dramatic Art and performed in various stage productions.

In the 1980s, Gibson established himself as a leading actor with critically acclaimed performances in films like "Gallipoli" (1981), which earned him a Best Actor Award from the Australian Film Institute. He became a household name after starring in "Mad Max" (1979) and its sequels, which helped launch his international career.

Gibson's directorial debut came with "The Man Without a Face" (1993), but he achieved significant acclaim with "Braveheart" (1995), a historical epic for which he won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture. He later directed "The Passion of the Christ" (2004), which became a massive box office success despite its controversial content. Gibson's other notable directorial work includes "Apocalypto" (2006) and "Hacksaw Ridge" (2016), the latter earning him further critical recognition.

Despite his early success, Gibson's career faced challenges due to personal controversies, including legal issues and leaked recordings of him making inflammatory remarks. However, he experienced a resurgence in Hollywood with roles in films like "Edge of Darkness" (2010) and "The Beaver" (2011), as well as a successful return to directing with "Hacksaw Ridge."

Gibson's personal life has been equally public, including a high-profile marriage to Robyn Moore, with whom he has seven children, and a tumultuous relationship with Oksana Grigorieva, which involved legal disputes and allegations of domestic violence. He has also been open about his struggles with alcoholism and has sought treatment multiple times.

Throughout his career, Gibson has received numerous accolades and remains a significant figure in the film industry, known for his contributions both as an actor and a director. His work has earned over $2.5 billion at the U.S. box office, making him one of the most commercially successful filmmakers in history.</p>

                <h2 class="article-title">Mel Gibson - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h2>
                <p class="article-content">Mel Gibson is a prominent American actor and film director, best known for his roles in action films and for his directorial work. Born on January 3, 1956, in Peekskill, New York, he is the sixth of eleven children in an Irish-American family. His father, Hutton Gibson, a World War II veteran and writer, moved the family to Australia in 1968 when Mel was 12 years old, seeking better economic opportunities and to avoid the Vietnam War draft for his eldest son.

Gibson studied acting at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney and gained recognition for his performances in films like "Mad Max" (1979), "Gallipoli" (1981), "Lethal Weapon" (1987), and "Braveheart" (1995), the latter of which he also directed, winning two Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. He directed "The Passion of the Christ" in 2004, which sparked controversy and allegations of antisemitism, impacting his career.

Despite facing significant backlash, Gibson's career experienced a resurgence with the release of "Hacksaw Ridge" in 2016, which garnered critical acclaim and multiple Academy Award nominations. In addition to his acting and directing career, Gibson is a dual citizen of the United States and Ireland, and he holds Australian permanent residency. His personal life includes a notable family background, with one of his younger brothers, Donal, also pursuing an acting career.</p>
