                "content": "The Kansas City Chiefs came into Week 16 with concerns about how quarterback Patrick Mahomes would look after suffering a \"mild\" high-ankle sprain in the team's Week 15 win over the Cleveland Browns. Mahomes quickly put those worries to bed in Kansas City's 27-19 victory over the Houston Texans. He showed he was healthy by scrambling for 27 yards and a touchdown on two carries on Kansas City's open drive and never looked back. Mahomes finished the day going 28-of-41 for 260 yards and a touchdown. He connected well with Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown (five catches, 45 yards) in his team debut while also continuing to see his chemistry with rookie Xavier Worthy (seven catches, 65 yards, one touchdown) grow. As a result, the Chiefs now need to win just once more to clinch the AFC's No. 1 seed. They can also clinch the top seed if the Buffalo Bills lose any of their final three games. The Texans had a fighting chance in this one-score loss, and it appeared they had changed the momentum when C.J. Stroud hit Tank Dell for a 30-yard touchdown to cut the Chiefs' lead to 17-16 early in the third quarter. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. However, Dell suffered a gruesome-looking knee injury on the play. He had to be carted off the field in an air cast, which left many Texans players emotional. After the injury and delay, Ka'imi Fairbairn missed an extra point, which set the tone for the rest of the game. The Dell injury took the wind out Houston's sails offensively and the team simply couldn't overcome the loss of its No. 2 receiver across from Nico Collins. The Texans scored just three more points and dropped to 9-6, positioning the AFC South winner as the likely No. 4 seed in the AFC playoff picture. USA TODAY Sports provided live updates, highlights and more from the Chiefs-Texans Saturday matchup below. On the first play after the two-minute warning, Hunt runs up the middle for 13 yards. The Chiefs can kneel on it from here and earn their 14th win of the 2024 NFL season. The Chiefs got a key sack of C.J. Stroud on a third-and-11 after Kansas City's field goal drive. Joshua Williams came on a cornerback blitz and nobody picked him up, forcing the Texans to punt with just 3:41 left in regulation. Houston has just two timeouts and the two-minute warning left to stop the clock. With a couple of first downs, the Chiefs may be able to run the clock out on this game. The Chiefs re-extended their lead to eight points after Harrison Butker made a chip-shot, 27-yard field goal to cap off a 14-play, 6:33 drive. The Texans got a much-needed stop on third-and-5 when Patrick Mahomes launched a pass toward Kelce in the back of the end-zone. Worthy flashed in front of the tight end, along with a defender, and went for the ball, assuming it was intended for him. The rookie couldn't make the catch and denied Kelce a chance at grabbing it. In fairness to Worthy, the defender may have been able to knock the ball down anyway, as Mahomes' pass came in on a low trajectory. Either way, Kansas City leads 27-19 with 5:13 left in the fourth quarter. The Texans had a golden opportunity in the red zone, but constant pressure from the Chiefs defense and a delay of game penalty pushed Houston to attempt a Ka'imi Fairbairn field goal. That pushed the Texans to within a touchdown, 24-19. Xavier Worthy accounted for 46 yards of offense on Kansas City's scoring drive, and he capped it off with a touchdown grab from the arm of Patrick Mahomes. Mahomes is 21-of-31 passing for 190 yards and two touchdowns on the day as the Chiefs extend their lead to 24-16 with 2:42 left in the third quarter. The Texans wide receiver was eventually taken off the field in a medical cart after his injury. The Texans would confirm that Dell suffered an injury to his left knee. Play resumed at Arrowhead Stadium after Dell received several minutes of medical attention on the field. He was stretchered off in an air cast after getting hurt on the Texans' touchdown after suffering a serious-looking knee injury. The Texans were shaken up after the injury, with several players showing emotion in its wake. It isn't clear if that had an impact on Fairbairn, but the veteran kicker missed his first extra point attempt of the season following the delay. As a result, the Chiefs still lead 17-16. The NBC broadcast cut back to Arrowhead Stadium to show Dell still down and being tended to on the field, with a cart out of the locker room. The cameras then showed a clearly emotional Stroud, who was among the players gathered around Dell. The good news for the Texans: C.J. Stroud hit Dell on a perfectly thrown 30-yard touchdown pass. The bad news: Dell was hit by his teammate while making the catch and suffered an apparent leg injury during the play. Dell immediately reached for his leg after the play. The Texans medical staff immediately came out to tend to him on the field. The Texans defense got off to a good start in the second half. They limited the Chiefs to five plays on their first drive before forcing Mahomes into a third-and-long. The quarterback tried to get the ball to Xavier Worthy, but Lassiter broke up the pass after undercutting the route. Tank Dell had a nice return of Matt Araiza's punt and that gave the Texans great starting field position around midfield. The Chiefs' mascot is a wolf known as KC Wolf. He was introduced in 1989 and \"has been bringing energy and excitement, as well as laughs and smiles to audiences of all ages,\" according to the team's official website. Houston's offense has moved the ball well against Kansas City's defense, but the team has been guilty of plenty of negative plays. That includes two interceptions and a few negative-yardage runs and screen pass efforts. Below is a look at the Texans' notable first-half stats: Patrick Mahomes is spreading the ball around as usual in the Chiefs' Week 16 game against the Texans, but it's becoming clear that Hollywood Brown is going to be one of his favorite targets now that the veteran is back from an injured collarbone. Below is a look at the Chiefs' notable first-half stats: The back-and-forth first half between the Chiefs and Texans came to an end after a C.J. Stroud Hail Mary attempt was knocked down at the goal line. Kansas City has gotten a strong showing from Patrick Mahomes, who is showing no signs of the ankle injury he dealt with leading up to the Week 16 contest. He has completed 13-of-20 passes for 127 yards while adding a touchdown and 27 yards on the ground. Meanwhile, Stroud has been shakier, making some big passing plays, including a 10-yard touchdown to Dalton Schultz, but has also tossed two interceptions. The Chiefs are set to get the ball first after halftime. They scored 10 unanswered points to close the half. After missing a 29-yard field goal on his lone attempt last week, Butker makes his first attempt in Week 16 from 44 yards away. That gives the Chiefs the lead with 19 seconds left in the half. The Texans were facing a third-and-20 on the edge of field goal range when Stroud tried to force a pass amid pressure. The result? Stroud hit Trent McDuffie over the middle of the field, and that allowed Chiefs to get the ball back with just under a minute left in the half. The Chiefs are back on top after an easy score for Hunt. The veteran back entered the game on a first-and-goal and patiently waited for the Chiefs' interior offensive line to open a lane for him to the end-zone. It developed, he saw it and powered through the final yard to put the Chiefs up 14-10. Kansas City's go-ahead drive covered 82 yards and was 13 plays long. The Chiefs converted four third downs on the drive and will now look to protect a lead with 4:38 left until halftime. No, Brown's first name is still Marquise. He just prefers to go by his nickname \"Hollywood,\" which most broadcasts are now doing. Brown grew up in Hollywood, Fla., which is how he earned the nickname. It lends itself well to him given his origins and his flashy, speedy style of play when healthy. A strange play just unfolded in Saturday's Chiefs vs. Texans game. Houston pressured Patrick Mahomes and appeared to force the quarterback to fumble. The Texans picked up the ball and brought it all the way to the end zone for a touchdown. However, the play was later ruled an incomplete pass just before Derek Barnett was called for roughing the passer. As such, the Chiefs avoided a third-and-10 and took the ball across midfield while the Texans were denied a chance to go up by two scores. Mahomes had been sacked 35 times entering Week 16. That is easily the most he has ever been sacked in a single season, seven more than his previous career high of 28 in 2021. Stroud faced pressure from George Karlaftis on a first-and-goal from the 10-yard line but scrambled out to his right to create time to throw. Eventually, he found Schultz wide open in the middle of the field and lofted a pass to him for an easy completion. The Kansas City crowd jeered the officials for choosing not to flag what it believed was a holding call against the Texans on Karlaftis. Ka'imi Fairbairn converted on the extra point to give the Texans a 10-7 lead. Kansas City may be leading after 15 minutes, but Houston is driving and nearing scoring range. Nico Collins caught a 32-yard pass to close the quarter after winning quickly off the line of scrimmage and forcing the Chiefs defensive back to chase him down along the sidelines. C.J. Stroud is 7-of-11 for 74 yards in the early goings of the game, though he did throw an interception on a first-drive overthrow. His counterpart, Patrick Mahomes, has gone an efficient 6-of-7 for 38 yards but also has run for 27 yards and a touchdown, showing that his injured ankle isn't much of a concern at all. The Texans were able to pressure and sack Mahomes on their second defensive drive, something they couldn't do their first time playing defense. They will need to continuing doing that to keep Kansas City's offense out of rhythm. Mahomes has been sacked more during the 2024 NFL season than he has at any point during his career. He took another one on the team's second drive when Harris came on a blitz and dropped the Chiefs quarterback. Mahomes got up just fine after the hit, which was notable given his injury. The loss pushed the team back into a third-and-long, however, and Kansas City was forced to punt the ball back to the Texans after failing to convert that. The Chiefs lost to the Buffalo Bills 30-21 in a Week 11 during which Josh Allen racked up 317 yards and two touchdowns. That marks Kansas City's only defeat of the 2024 NFL season through 15 weeks. C.J. Stroud and the Houston offense mounted a good response to Kansas City's touchdown drive, as Nico Collins, Tank Dell and Joe Mixon ripped off some big plays to get the Texans into the red zone. Ultimately, they stalled out and Ka'imi Fairbairn came on to attempt a 33-yard field goal. Fairbairn made the chip-shot to get the Texans on the board and make it 7-3 Chiefs. How healthy is Mahomes' injured ankle? The Chiefs quarterback isn't as fast as he has usually is, but he also showed that fans shouldn't be overly concerned about his mobility being impacted by his \"mild\" high-ankle sprain. Mahomes ran for 12 yards on a third-and-13 earlier in the drive before taking off from the 15-yard line later to score a touchdown on a run up the middle. Mahomes now has 27 rushing yards in the first quarter of the game. That's already the fourth-most he has recorded in a single game this season. The Texans faced a third-and-12 on their first drive and Stroud tried to force a downfield shot to Collins in double coverage. Rookie Jaden Hicks caught the overthrown pass and set Kansas City up with great field position on its first drive of the day. Houston's first drive is off to an inauspicious start, as starting right guard Mason was hurt just four plays into it. He walked off the field under his own power but headed for the blue medical tent. The Texans were already without starting left guard Juice Scruggs and will be forced to put either Kenyon Green or Kendrick Green into action. The Chiefs and Texans are scheduled for kick off on Saturday at 1 p.m. ET, noon CT. NBC will broadcast the Chiefs-Texans matchup in Week 16. Noah Eagle will be on play-by-play, and he will be flanked by Todd Blackledge (color commentary). It appears that Swift is in attendance for the Chiefs' Saturday matchup with the Texans. She was spotted getting onto a golf cart at Arrowhead Stadium and is presumably be transported to her suite to watch her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, in action. The Chiefs wide receiver, who has not played at all in 2024, will make his season debut on Saturday. Brown suffered a shoulder injury during preseason and will be a major boost to the Chiefs wide receiver corps. Noah Eagle (play-by-play) and Todd Blackledge (color commentary) will be the announcers for the Chiefs vs. Texans games. The duo usual broadcasts NBC's package of prime-time college games, but they were called up to the NFL level to allow Mike Tirico and Cris Collinsworth to call just one game over the weekend. Kathryn Tappen will join Eagles and Blackledge as a sideline reporter. Yes, Noah Eagle is Ian Eagle's son. The 28-year-old attended Syracuse and broke into sports media in 2019 before rapidly rising the ranks to become a major network play-by-play man. Carson Wentz is the Chiefs' backup quarterback for the 2024 NFL season. The former Philadelphia Eagles star signed a one-year deal with the Chiefs during the offseason to take on that role after playing behind Matthew Stafford with the Los Angeles Rams in the second half of the 2023 NFL season. On Thursday, head coach Andy Reid told reporters he expected his quarterback to make the start. That turned out to be true, as Mahomes will to start vs. the Houston. Patrick Mahomes and Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown will both play vs. the Texans today. Mahomes avoids missing a game due to injury, while Brown is making his season debut. The Texans will be without starting guard Juice Scruggs and a handful of veteran role players for Sunday's game against the Chiefs.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) Patrick Mahomes knew he could run on the ankle he sprained last week. The bigger concern for the Chiefs quarterback was how he would stop, when all the weight and pressure and momentum would land squarely upon it. The solution against Houston was simple: Mahomes didn't stop. The two-time MVP kept chugging forward until he plowed into the end zone on a 15-yard scramble to cap the Chiefs' opening drive on Saturday. Mahomes proceeded to throw for 260 yards and another score, never once looking troubled by his ailing ankle, and led Kansas City to a 27-19 victory that put the Chiefs on the brink of the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs. The Chiefs (14-1) can clinch the postseason bye and home-field advantage if Buffalo loses to or ties New England on Sunday. If the Bills win, Kansas City can wrap it up by beating Pittsburgh on Christmas Day - its third game in an 11-day span. “I ask a lot from the guys around me. I feel like if I'm going to ask them to play through pain and nicks and bruises, I've got to do it as well,” Mahomes said. “That's something that I pride myself on is being out there with my guys.” Xavier Worthy had seven catches for 65 yards and a touchdown, Kareem Hunt ran for 55 yards and another score, and Marquise Brown had five catches for 45 yards for Kansas City in his first game this season after recovering from a shoulder injury. The result was what Chiefs coach Andy Reid called his team's most comprehensive performance of the season. As for Mahomes? “He spoils the dog out of us, he's so tough,” Reid said. “You get used to it. But most guys don't come back from that like he did.” C.J. Stroud threw for 244 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions for Houston (9-6), and one of those TD throws came at a great expense. Tank Dell, who had six catches for 98 yards, sustained a devastating knee injury on the play and was taken to the University of Kansas Medical Center, where Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said he would remain overnight. “All our thoughts and prayers are with Tank right now. You see what he means to our entire team,” Ryans said. “It hurts to see him go down like that. He was having a fantastic game, playing really well for us.” Stroud was visibly shaken by the injury and had to be consoled by teammates on the sideline. “I mean, all you can really do is pray,” he said. There were questions early in the week about whether Mahomes, who has a history of ankle injuries, would play at all after he sustained a high ankle sprain late in last week's win over Cleveland. But he was off the injury report by Friday, and he was on the field and leading the Chiefs to a touchdown on their opening possession. His scramble for a score was merely the start of a back-and-forth first half. The Texans answered with a 33-yard field goal, then went on a 13-play, 82-yard drive that ended with Stroud's touchdown toss to Dalton Schutlz. But the Chiefs quickly regained the lead when Hunt barreled into the end zone, and they tacked on a field goal a few minutes later after Stroud's second interception to lead 17-10 at the break. Dell was hurt on the Texans' opening drive of the third quarter. He was coming across the back of the end zone and made a spectacular catch but collided with teammate Jared Wayne on his way to the ground. He immediately grabbed his left knee, and players from both teams surrounded him as he was loaded onto a cart and driven from the field. Ka'imi Fairbairn promptly missed the extra point, and any momentum Houston might've had disappeared. Kansas City marched the other way, relying heavily on Worthy, who touched the ball four times on the drive. The first-round pick finished it off with an 8-yard reception, giving him a season high for receiving yards and his eighth touchdown of the year. The teams matched fourth-quarter field goals, and the Texans took over trailing 27-19 with just over five minutes to go. But the Chiefs forced a three-and-out, getting a sack from Josh Williams on a cornerback blitz, and ran out the clock from there. “This was a great test versus a really good playoff team,” Ryans said. “This was a playoff atmosphere here today. I thought our guys battled the right way. We just have to finish.” Pop star Taylor Swift was on hand for the Chiefs' regular-season finale. She has been spending more time with her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, in Kansas City since she wrapped up her Eras Tour on Dec. 8 in Vancouver, British Columbia, including making a surprise visit to Children's Mercy Hospital. Houston: OG Shaq Mason (left knee) left on the fourth play of the game. FS Jimmie Ward (foot) was hurt late in the first half. Kansas City: LB Jack Cochrane fractured his ankle on special teams in the first quarter. RT Jawaan Taylor (knee) left in the third quarter and DT Chris Jones sustained a minor calf strain in the fourth.

                "content": "There has been only one team to win 16 regular-season games. That was the 2007 New England Patriots. If the Kansas City Chiefs match the 2007 Patriots, it won’t carry the same weight. They are playing 17 games, not the 16 that was the NFL norm for years. But they might be on their way to a 16-1 record. So much attention has been paid to how the Chiefs win that them winning almost every week has been overshadowed. The Chiefs improved to 14-1 this season and are closing in on getting the AFC’s No. 1 seed after a 27-19 win over the Houston Texans on Saturday. It was the 16th straight win for the Chiefs in one-score games, extending their NFL record streak. It wasn’t a particularly dominant performance but it had a familiar result. The Chiefs have won in strange and sometimes unbelievable ways. They’ve rarely blown anyone out this season. But they keep winning, and might end up with as many regular-season wins as any team in NFL history. Since the Chiefs were playing, it wasn’t a surprise that it was a close game. Kansas City struck first. Patrick Mahomes suffered what was described as a mild high ankle sprain last week, and there was a brief concern over his availability for this weekend’s game, but Mahomes played and had some nice runs early. His 15-yard touchdown run opened up the scoring. MAHOMES TAKES IT HIMSELF FOR THE TD 🔥📺: #HOUvsKC on NBC/Peacock📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/soKpySTT8L — NFL (@NFL) December 21, 2024 The Texans battled back. QB C.J. Stroud had a nice touchdown pass across his body to tight end Dalton Schultz. He also had a 30-yard touchdown pass to Tank Dell but it was costly. Houston receiver Jared Wayne dove for the deep pass and inadvertently dove into Dell’s knee. It was immediately clear Dell had suffered a serious injury. He was carted off while his teammates were emotional. Stroud was in tears and had to be consoled by teammates. That injury seemed to understandably affect the Texans. They missed the extra point right after the Dell touchdown. The Chiefs drove on their defense, with Xavier Worthy catching a touchdown pass to extend Kansas City’s lead to 24-16. The Chiefs are hard enough to beat in ideal conditions. The Texans missing one of their best receivers, and worried about him as he left the field on a cart, didn’t help them. Houston didn’t score a touchdown after Dell’s injury. Clearly, the Chiefs have an edge in close games. The second half on Saturday looked like a lot of other Kansas City games. In the fourth quarter, the Chiefs had a 14-play drive that took 6:33 off the clock. It ended with a field goal, but that kept the pressure on the Texans to be perfect. Houston couldn’t come up with its own long drive after that. Trailing 27-19, Stroud was sacked on third down and the Texans punted. Mahomes hit Samaje Perine for a big conversion on third-and-4 to chew up more clock. Kareem Hunt had a first-down run after the two-minute warning to seal it. The Chiefs have an 89% chance of getting the No. 1 seed after the win, NBC said on its broadcast. They’ll clinch the top seed with a win at the Steelers on Christmas Day next week. A 15-1 Chiefs team wouldn’t have anything to play for in Week 18 and could sit some players. But a 15-2 regular season, coming off back-to-back Super Bowls, would be remarkable. As time goes on, how the Chiefs piled up all those wins will be forgotten. It will just be viewed as another dominant Chiefs team, which is perhaps on its way to a historic championship. A 20-yard run by Hunt gives the Chiefs the first down and ends any chance for a Houston comeback. The Texans are out of timeouts and Patrick Mahomes runs out the clock with two kneel downs. Kansas City improved to 13-1 and will finish the season undefeated at home (8-0), while the Texans fall to 9-6.

The Kansas City Chiefs maintained their hold on the AFC's top seed by securing yet another one-score victory, extending their NFL record to 16 games by defeating the visiting Houston Texans by a score of 27-19. The Chiefs got things started early by picking off C.J. Stroud on Houston's opening drive. Just in case anyone thought Patrick Mahomes would be limited by the high ankle sprain he suffered last week, he quickly quieted those concerns with a pair of scrambles on the Chiefs' first possession, with the second of those runs starting the scoring as he scored a touchdown from 15 yards out. The Texans would eventually answer back and actually take a 10-7 lead after Stroud found Dalton Schultz for a touchdown early in the second quarter, but Kansas City immediately answered with a Kareem Hunt touchdown run, another interception on Stroud and then a late-half field goal to take a seven-point lead into halftime. The Texans forced a punt on the opening drive of the second half and actually looked like they were about to tie the game when Stroud lofted a beautiful pass to Tank Dell in the back of the end zone, but Dell suffered a gruesome injury on the play and, after a long delay, Ka'imi Fairbairn missed the extra point. That one-point deficit was the closest Houston would get the rest of the afternoon. Even after Kansas City turned it over on downs near midfield, the Texans were unable to take advantage; and the Chiefs drove down the field for an Xavier Worthy touchdown on their next drive. After the two teams traded field goals, the Texans had a chance to drive for a game-tying score late in the fourth quarter, but went nowhere after Stroud got dropped for a sack on third-and-long. All Kansas City had to do after that was run out the clock, which it did with a series of runs and short passes. Standard Chiefs stuff in another standard Chiefs win in what is looking a lot like a standard Chiefs season in the Mahomes-Andy Reid era. Strong game-planning, Mahomes magic and timely turnovers. Kansas City's offensive line has struggled all season, and Andy Reid devised a game plan to account for that. Mahomes repeatedly fired quick passes to Xavier Worthy and DeAndre Hopkins, and Travis Kelce repeatedly sat himself down in underneath zones. Mahomes was under pressure often, but only sacked once. The defense, meanwhile, came up with a pair of interceptions to bookend the first half, setting up the offense to score 10 free points. Major miscues in big moments, and a defense that just couldn't get the big stop. Houston ended its first drive of the game and its last drive of the first half with interceptions. Ka'imi Fairbairn missed an extra point. C.J. Stroud took not one but two delay-of-game penalties in the second half. Dalton Schultz dropped what should have been a third-down conversion late in the third quarter. Offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik kept calling wide receiver screens that went nowhere. Meanwhile, the Chiefs converted 7 of 13 third downs and 3 of their 4 red zone opportunities into touchdowns, while Houston went just 1 of 3 in the red zone. Late in the second quarter, the Texans had a chance to take the lead -- or at least cut into Kansas City's advantage. They quickly got into Chiefs territory before things started going awry. Tank Dell was called for offensive pass interference on a swing pass on first down, setting the Texans back behind the chains. Two incomplete passes later and it was third-and-20 from Kansas City's 40-yard line. The Texans were in Ka'imi Fairbairn's range, so when C.J. Stroud saw quick pressure, he tried to throw the ball away to preserve a shot at a field goal. But his throwaway didn't actually go away. Instead, it landed in the waiting arms of Trent McDuffie. Instead of having a chance to take a lead for themselves, the Texans were left defending against the Chiefs extending theirs. They buckled down once Kansas City got just outside the red zone, but the Chiefs took a 17-10 lead into halftime and never trailed again. The best play of the day was Tank Dell's 30-yard touchdown grab in the third quarter, but Dell unfortunately suffered a gruesome knee injury on the play. (If you really want to watch it, you can do so right here.) So instead, we'll go with the game's first touchdown, where we saw pretty early on that Patrick Mahomes' ankle was just fine. Mere days after suffering a high ankle sprain, Mahomes had two big scrambles on Kansas City's opening drive, including the one above. He ended the afternoon with three carries for 35 yards and the score, helping move the chains for the Chiefs several times. Kansas City is 14-1 and remains the No. 1 seed in the AFC. The Chiefs have long since clinched the AFC West and have the inside track for home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. Next up for K.C. is a Christmas Day game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, followed by a trip to Denver to take on the Broncos in Week 18. The Texans are now 9-6 and looking like they will be the No. 4 seed in the AFC. They're already AFC South champions, but they've likely fallen too far behind the AFC North winner to move up to No. 3 in the conference. They close out their season by hosting the Baltimore Ravens on Christmas, then traveling to Tennessee to take on the Titans in Week 18. That'll do it, folks. The Chiefs can now kneel on the ball and run out the clock. ANOTHER one-score win for the Chiefs, who will move to 14-1. A first-down run for negative yards set the Texans back on their game-tying drive attempt. (What else is new?) And then Stroud fired a ball out of bounds under heavy pressure, then took a third-down sack with Joshua Williams coming unblocked blitzing off the edge. K.C. has a chance to potentially run the clock out here. No Chris Jones out there for the Chiefs defense on this drive. He's questionable to return with a calf injury. Mahomes tried to fire the ball back across his body to Kelce in the back of the end zone, but Worthy didn't see Kelce behind him and tried to catch it himself. The ball bounced off his hands and fell incomplete, so Harrison Butker knocked a field goal through the uprights to make it an 8-point game once again. Houston has just over 5 minutes to drive for a potential game-tying score. Houston again drove into Kansas City territory, but again had issues with negative plays. A first-down run was tackled behind the line of scrimmage. A C.J. Stroud scramble turned into a sack. And Stroud took his second delay-of-game penalty of the half. The Texans ended up settling for a field goal to make it a 5-point game. Yet another one-possession game for both the Chiefs and Texans, who have each been great in close contests this year. Fourth quarter coming up. This is Worthy's best game of the year, in terms of his overall level of involvement in the offense. He just picked up his seventh catch of the game, and this one goes for a touchdown. (He also has three carries.) Chiefs up by 8 after the extra point. Perfect ball from Stroud to Schultz on third down but Schultz just straight dropped it. Worth nothing, Stroud and Dell connected on the exact same throw in the exact same situation earlier in the game. Kansas City had excellent field position after a great kick return following the Dell touchdown, but Isaiah Pacheco's three carries totaled -1 yard and he was stuffed for no gain on fourth-and-1. Texans take over in Chiefs territory now with a chance to re-take the lead. Dell's fractured leg came on Dec. 3 of last year. He also suffered a gunshot wound this offseason after a stray bullet went through his leg when he was an innocent bystander. And now this knee injury. So horrible for such a talented, electrifying player. You can see how bad it is by looking at Stroud and Collins, who are absolutely distraught. What an awful, awful scene. The cart is out for Dell and he's being taken to the locker room. Ugh. Oh no. Tank Dell just made a fantastic touchdown catch in the back of the end zone, for arguably his best catch of the year. More than likely ties the game for Houston after the extra point. But in the process, he took a hit to the outside of his knee, which bent in the wrong direction. He knew immediately after he went down that it was a problem. Remember, he fractured his leg at the end of last season as well. Y-I-K-E-S. The Texans just burned a timeout on their second play of the half, after an incomplete pass. That is really, really bad -- especially when you're in a one-score game against the Chiefs, on the road. Kamari Lassiter ALMOST picked off Patrick Mahomes. Great play to dive and get his hands on the ball on the crossing route intended for Worthy, who had a step of separation. Both Worthy and Dell are on the sideline with their teams to start the second half and look like they're ready to go. The Chiefs took advantage of Stroud's second turnover of the game by scoring for a second time. 10 points off turnovers for the Chiefs. And they get the ball to start the second half with a chance to make this a two-score game. Not ideal for the Chiefs. Worthy has been extremely involved so far today, with 4 catches and 2 rushing attempts. It looked like he fell while running his route before limping to the sideline. KC's wide receiver corps has been banged up all season. Update: Worthy is QUESTIONABLE to return with an ankle injury. Whoo boy. Really bad decision and throw from Stroud on this third-and-20. He was under heavy pressure and tried to jump and just get rid of the ball to avoid a sack, but instead threw it right into Trent McDuffie's arms. Big time missed opportunity for Houston. And now Dell just got called for a seemingly phantom offensive pass interference, then went to the bench to get checked out with some sort of injury. He threw his helmet towards a trainer, which doesn't seem great. Update: Dell is back after missing one snap. Tank Dell already has 5 catches. He only had four entire games with 5 catches coming into today. And his 68 yards are already his third-most of the season. After a 13-play, 82-yard drive, Kansas City has the lead back. The Chiefs converted four third-down opportunities on the drive, which Kareem Hunt polished off with a 3-yard touchdown run. KC gets the ball coming out in the third quarter, so the Texans will want to put some points on the board here to prevent a double-up opportunity. VERY bad injury news for the Texans. Ward has been a key player in the secondary all season, moving between safety and the slot. He got his ankle rolled up while trying to shake a block from Travis Kelce. Wow, a HUGE swing right there. Not only does a review overturn the Mahomes fumble that resulted in a scoop-and-score; because the play was ruled a pass, Tim Settle got called for roughing the passer and gave Kansas City a free 15 yards. Hollywood Brown has now played five snaps (all passing plays) and has two catches for 32 yards. Really nice job by C.J. Stroud to buy some time in the pocket here by rolling out to his right and drafting just a little bit backward. Dalton Schultz kind of tossed Trent McDuffie aside and freed himself up in the middle of the end zone for the touchdown. Nice bounceback by the Texans after the early interception and subsequent touchdown drive. They're now up 10-7. (Schultz probably could've been called for OPI, and there was probably a hold that prevented George Karlaftis from getting to Stroud, too.) Stroud is bailing the Texans out of some tough third downs. Three conversions already on this drive. Things looked really discombobulated for a minute on third-and-medium for the Texans, but Stroud and Collins bailed them out. Stroud was under heavy pressure and just floated the ball into open space before Collins even made his break, and Collins made a great adjustment to get to the ball and then create some yards after the catch. Really well-designed blitz from DeMeco Ryans to get a Christian Harris sack on second down. He came totally unblocked through the middle of the line. That sent KC's drive back and Mahomes just checked it down to Travis Kelce for a short gain on third down. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. BALTIMORE (AP) Lamar Jackson was solid in Baltimore's biggest game of the season so far. Then, after one of the star quarterback's rare slip-ups, one of his teammates delivered the play of the day. Jackson threw three touchdown passes and Marlon Humphrey scored on a fourth-quarter interception return to help the Ravens pull even with Pittsburgh atop the AFC North with a 34-17 victory over the Steelers on Saturday. Pittsburgh (10-5) would have clinched the division with a victory, but now the teams are deadlocked after the Ravens (10-5) won for just the second time in the last 10 games in this series. Baltimore clinched a playoff berth. The Steelers had already done so. “It was cool to get a pick-6, but clinching a spot in the playoffs, to beat the Steelers, I'm just happy that the guys came in, put in the work, and we just took care of business,” Humphrey said. “I felt that this team has had our number over the years. Just take care of business, man. I felt like the performance we put on wasn't perfect, but I felt like that's what we were supposed to do.” Russell Wilson threw two touchdown passes, the second of which tied the game at 17 with 5:14 left in the third quarter. Jackson answered with a 7-yard scoring strike to Mark Andrews, and after Pittsburgh turned the ball over on downs, a 44-yard run by Derrick Henry put the Ravens in the red zone. That drive came to nothing when Jackson was intercepted for just the fourth time this season, but then Humphrey - who was celebrating the recent birth of his son Duke - picked off Wilson and went 37 yards to the end zone to give Baltimore a cushion in a series that’s been razor-thin of late. The previous nine games between the Steelers and Ravens were decided by seven points or fewer. “My whole family's in town to help out with my wife and everything,” Humphrey said. “I was texting her before. I'm supposed to go pick her up from the hospital, discharge her with the baby. So there's a lot of just great things that happened this week.” Jackson improved to 2-4 against Pittsburgh as a starter. This was his first time facing the Steelers at home since 2020. “I feel like we've been busting our behind all season long, had ups and downs throughout this whole season, but to clinch a playoff against a great team like that, that's great,” Jackson said. “That means we're moving in the right direction.” Henry rushed for 162 yards. Pittsburgh entered the game with a plus-18 margin in turnovers, but the Ravens had the edge in that department Saturday. Baltimore recovered three of its own fumbles and had two big takeaways. “We didn’t control the run game. We never did. When you don’t, you’ve got to do some splash plays or win the turnover battle in a significant way, and we didn’t do that either,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. “There were some balls on the ground that we didn’t get. Then obviously we turned the ball over going in -- it took seven points off the board -- and they had a pick-6. The rest is history, as they say.” Jackson found Isaiah Likely for a 9-yard touchdown to open the scoring. Wilson answered with a 1-yard scoring pass to MyCole Pruitt, and the Steelers appeared poised to take the lead when the veteran quarterback broke loose for a 19-yard run in Baltimore territory. But Ar'Darius Washington delivered a punishing hit on Wilson at the end of that play, jarring the ball loose. Kyle Van Noy recovered for the Ravens at the Baltimore 4. The Ravens then drove 96 yards and took a 14-7 lead on Jackson's 14-yard touchdown toss to Rashod Bateman. Wilson threw a 12-yard TD to Cordarrelle Patterson to tie it in the third. Jackson set a team record with his 37th touchdown pass of the season, and he's now up to a career high of 3,787 yards. Ravens receiver Zay Flowers had five catches for 100 yards, surpassing 1,000 on the season. Henry has exceeded 1,500 yards rushing for the fourth time. He's now up to 1,607, a mark he's only surpassed once - in his 2,027-yard campaign of 2020. Steelers CB Joey Porter Jr. injured his calf, and WR Ben Skowronek hurt his hip. ... Baltimore RB Justice Hill left the game because of a concussion. Both teams play on Christmas Day to wrap up stretches of three games in 11 days. Pittsburgh hosts Kansas City on Wednesday and Baltimore plays at Houston. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

With their defeat on Saturday, the Steelers dropped to 10-5 and have now lost two consecutive games. Pittsburgh will head back home to square off against the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas Day in Week 17 and will look to end this disappointing two-game skid. The AFC North has consistently been one of the most competitive divisions in football, and the division is now up for grabs after Pittsburgh's loss. The Steelers could've clinched their first division title since 2020 with a victory over the Ravens, but the race for the division will be eventful in the final two weeks. Baltimore improved their record to 10-5 after defeating Pittsburgh on Saturday, and with both teams owning the same record and winning one game each in the season series, the Ravens and Steelers are tied for the first-place lead in the AFC North. Both teams also have the same division records (3-2). Pittsburgh defeated Baltimore by a score of 18-16 back in Week 11 at Acruisure Field. T-1. Baltimore Ravens (10-5) T-1. Pittsburgh Steelers (10-5) 3. Cincinnati Bengals (6-8) 4. Cleveland Browns (3-11) It all comes down to the final two weeks to decide the winner of the AFC North. As stated above, the Steelers will play the Chiefs in Week 17 and will be looking to get back in the win column after a rough last two weeks. Tomlin's group will finish the regular season at home versus the Cincinnati Bengals. The Ravens will also play on Christmas Day in Week 17, as John Harbaugh's squad will travel to NRG Stadium to square off against the Houston Texans. Baltimore will conclude the regular season at home versus the Cleveland Browns. If both teams win their final two contests, the Steelers and Ravens will finish with the same regular season record and division record. In this scenario, Pittsburgh would take home the AFC North crown because they would boast the better record versus all AFC opponents unless Baltimore has the better record in common games. Obviously, if one team wins out or the other loses out, then the team that wins out would snatch the division title. There are a lot more scenarios that could play out between the Steelers and Ravens, and we can't list them all, so let's take a look at the tiebreaking scenarios. Tiebreaking Scenarios: 1. Head-to-head (best won-lost-tied percentage in games between the clubs).2. Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the division.3. Best won-lost-tied percentage in common games.4. Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the conference.5. Strength of victory in all games.6. Strength of schedule in all games7. Best combined ranking among conference teams in points scored and points allowed in all games.8. Best combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed in all games.9. Best net points in common games.10. Best net points in all games.11. Best net touchdowns in all games.12. Coin toss So, long story short: The final two games of the season will decide who wins the AFC North, and the Steelers must finish the regular season strong.

                "content": "The two biggest plays of the game were made by the Ravens defense on plays you could call mistakes by Russell Wilson. He went 22/33 for 217 yards and two TDs but this pick six by Marlon Humphery shut the door on the Steelers. The Ravens are now tied at 10-5 with Steelers at the top of the AFC North, but Pittsburgh still holds the slight tiebreaker which means if they win out they win the division. They have the Chiefs on Christmas Day and the Bengals in the final week of the season. The Ravens have the Texans and the Browns to close out the season. Should Pittsburgh lose a game and Baltimore win out, the Ravens would take the division title. Just when it looked like the Ravens were going to put the game out of reach, the Steelers defense did what the Steelers defense does. They came up with a play that kept the team in the game, this time it was Minkah Fitzpatrick who made the red zone pick, but the joy would be short lived. Derrick Henry was a monster all game long. He usually gets stronger as the game goes on, but he started off on fire and never cooled down. This 44 yard run was his longest on a night that he went for 162 yards on 24 carries. Jackson and the Ravens punched back just six plays later with Jackson's third TD toss of the night. This one went to Mark Andrews in the back of the end zone. Jackson has thrown eight TD passes in the last two games, and he went 15/23 for 207 yards and 3 TDs with just one pick in the win. the Steelers weren't done. The tied the game up midway through the third quarter after a 44 yard completion from Wilson to Calvin Austin III set up this TD pass for Cordarrelle Patterson. This was a heavyweight battle and both teams were exchanging blows for the first three quarters. After the fumble the Ravens went 95 yards down the field and took the lead in a 14 point swing as Jackson found Rachod Bateman in the end zone to put BAL back in the lead. There was a lot of talk about Lamar Jackson not being able to beat the Steelers, but he came out with a point to prove against Pittsburgh with the division title on the line. Coming into the night we thought the Steelers had the defense that made the big, game changing plays but I don't know if anyone thought it would the Ravens were going to win this game with their defensive plays. The first one came on this Wilson scramble that looked like it could go for a TD but Ar'Darius Washington forced fumble that was recovered by Kyle Van Noy. The Steelers were driving to take the lead, but the Ravens not only kept them out of the end zone but kept them off the board. The Steelers went three and out on their first drive, but they bounced back with a balanced attack of Jaylen Warren running the football and Russell Wilson connecting on a handful of passes. Wilson found MyCole Pruitt in the back of the end zone to tie the game up with the first play of the second quarter. The Baltimore Ravens knew they needed to beat the Pittsburgh Steelers if they were going to have a chance to win the AFC North, and they got the job done to set up an interesting end of the season for these two teams.

Lamar Jackson and the Ravens start the ball from the 30 to begin the game. Coming into Week 16 we see the Chiefs at the top of the AFC, currently in the top spot for the one seed and home field advantage. They have some tough games coming up, and if they slip the Bills will be waiting, but it’s unlikely a one loss team losses multiple games in the next few weeks. That means the these two teams will likely be putting all their energy on winning the AFC North and earning home field advantage in at least one game in the playoffs. The Steelers have already clinched a playoff spot with 10 wins, while the Ravens can do that today with a win. Should they lose there is a miniscule chance they don’t make the playoffs but they would have to lose out and the Dolphins or Colts would have to win out. So basically these two teams are in, but both of these teams are desperate to win the division. That means they will have to win today in Baltimore. It was an old school, rock ‘em sock ‘em AFC North game filled with defense, big hits and not much scoring. The Steelers held Lamar Jackson to just 207 yards 1 TD and 1 INT and Derrick Henry to just 65 yards on 13 carries as the then top rated offense scored just 16 points. The Steelers offense didn’t do much better, but the six Chris Boswell field goals were enough to hold off the Ravens. As always the Steelers defense came up with some huge plays including a 4th quarter interception and a two point conversion stand after the Ravens scored a late TD that could have tied the game had they converted the two point conversion. The Steelers stars have been and still are on the defensive side of the ball. This team has lived and died on the defenses ability to shut the other team down and make the occasional big play that would change the game around. No one is more responsible for that than TJ Watt, who gave Steelers fans a big scare last week when he went down late in the game with an ankle injury. After being limited in practice early in the week he participated fully in practice on Thursday and he is good to go today. That will be a huge boost to this defense today against the reigning MVP of the league. TJ Watt has 54 tackles, 11.5 sacks and is the heart and soul of this defense that has had Lamar Jackson’s number over the last few years. Lamar Jackson is the most explosive player in the league. With the ability to beat you with his legs or his arm, he constantly keeps defenses on edge, except when he plays against the Steelers. He is 2-5 against the Steelers in his career, and they have a history of being able to slow down the two time MVP of the league. This year, he has thrown for 3,580 yards (5th in the NFL), 34 TDs (2nd) and just 3 INTs (T-1st) and as another 743 yards rushing with three TDs on the ground. It looks as though Jackson is going to come up a little shy of being the first QB to throw for 4,000 yards and run for 1,000 yards in the same season, but he is still well in the MVP race. He will be much more interested in winning the remaining three games of the season and taking the Ravens back to the Super Bowl. This was supposed to be the year the Ravens made a deep playoff run and challenged the Chiefs for AFC supremacy. They got their chance at the Chiefs in the first week of the season and lost that game by a toe. Then they inexplicably blew a double digit second half lead against the Raiders before straightening the ship and winning the next five games. The Browns stunned them in Cleveland and the Ravens would lose three of their next six before their BYE week. Their win over the Giants puts them in position to win the AFC North, but they know they have to win this game after losing to the Steelers earlier in the year. After years of having the defense carry the load for a team that could barley move the ball on offense, Pittsburgh went out and signed two veteran QBs in a matter of days. Russell Wilson was hurt for the start of the season which meant Justin Fields started the season under center for the Steelers. Pittsburgh went 4-2 in his time, but the offensive problems persisted. Coach Mike Tomlin made the change in Week 7, starting Russell Wilson and boom, the Steelers put up 37 points against the Jets and then won their next three games including a a low scoring win against the Ravens in Pittsburgh. Their momentum was halted on a snowy night in Cleveland, but they bounced back scoring 44 points in a win over the Bengals and then exacted revenge on the Browns the week before last. The game in Philly was ugly, but they have a chance to silence some of the doubters who still might not be completely convinced by the offense. The Ravens came out of their BYE week in perfect circumstances. They got some much needed rest, and had a trip to New York for a match up with the Giants to get the “warmed up” for the rest of the season. Lamar Jackson went wild, throwing for 290 yards and 5 TDs to thrust his name right back into the MVP conversation. The Giants, who had Tim Boyle and Tommy DeVito in under center had no chance as the Ravens built up a 21-0 lead on a day that Derrick Henry had a light work load. The Ravens would wax the Giants, 35-14 and keep within a game of the Steelers to set up today’s massive matchup in Baltimore. The Steelers gauntlet of a schedule to end the season started last week in Philadelphia. The Eagles controlled the game from start to finish on a day that Pittsburgh only gained 163 yards of total offense. Despite their offensive troubles they were still in the game at halftime after a couple field goals and a TD pass from Russell Wilson to Pat Freiermuth sent the Steelers to half-time down 17-13. Philly dominated the second half, controlling the ball for 24 of the 30 minutes, holding the Steelers to just 54 yards on 11 plays and stretching their lead out to 27-13 after a field goal and a tush push from Jalen Hurts. Hurts had almost 300 yards, two TDs and another rushing TD while Russell Wilson had just 128 yards on 14/22 passing. Hello everyone and welcome to M&T Bank Stadium where the Ravens know they can take a big step towards winning the division with a win today. If they lose it will be almost impossible, and they will be forced to go on the road for each of their playoff games once the postseason comes rolling around. They are coming off one of their best performances of the year last week and the Ravens will look to keep it rolling against a Steelers team that have lost two of their last four games. They are in the midst of a brutal end of the season that could see them go from competing for a one seed in the AFC to the Wild Card spot if they aren’t careful. Needless to say, this one is a big one. Both of these teams know they will be in the playoffs but the question is who will win the division and earn the right to host at least one postseason game. There is going to be a playoff atmosphere this afternoon in Baltimore as two teams who are headed to the postseason will be fighting for the division from M&T Bank Stadium. The Pittsburgh Steelers lead the AFC North by just a game but the Baltimore Ravens have a chance to draw level with them with a win in this massive Saturday afternoon kickoff. AS English will be with you all game providing live coverage, stats, highlights and analysis of todays game with massive playoff implications.",

                "title": "Rickey Henderson - Wikipedia",
                "content": "As coach MLB records Rickey Nelson Henley Henderson (December 25, 1958 – December 20, 2024), nicknamed Man of Steal, was an American professional baseball left fielder who played 24 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for nine teams from 1979 to 2003, including four separate tenures with his original team, the Oakland Athletics. He is widely regarded as baseball's greatest leadoff hitter and baserunner.[1][2] He holds MLB records for career stolen bases, runs, unintentional walks, and leadoff home runs. At the time of his last major league game in 2003, the ten-time American League (AL) All-Star ranked among the sport's top 100 all-time home run hitters and was its all-time leader in walks. In 2009, he was inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Henderson holds the single-season record for stolen bases (130 in 1982) and is the only player in AL history to steal 100 bases in a season, having done so three times (in 1980, 1982, and 1983). His 1,406 career steals is 50% higher than the previous record of 938 by Lou Brock. Henderson is the all-time stolen base leader for the Oakland Athletics[3] and previously held the New York Yankees' franchise record from 1988 to 2011.[4][5] He was among the league's top ten base stealers in 21 different seasons. Henderson was named the AL's Most Valuable Player in 1990, and he was twice the lead-off hitter for World Series champions: the 1989 Oakland Athletics and the 1993 Toronto Blue Jays. A 12-time stolen base champion, Henderson led the league in runs five times. His 24-year career elevated him to the top ten in several other categories, including career at-bats, games, and outfield putouts and total chances. His high on-base percentage, power hitting, and stolen base and run totals made him one of the most dominant and innovative players of all time. He was further known for his unquenchable passion for playing baseball and a buoyant, eccentric, and quotable personality that both perplexed and entertained fans. Once asked if he thought Henderson was a future Hall of Famer, statistician Bill James replied, \"If you could split him in two, you'd have two Hall of Famers.\"[6] Henderson was born on December 25, 1958, in Chicago, Illinois, in the back seat of an Oldsmobile on the way to the hospital. Henderson later joked, \"I was already fast. I couldn't wait.\"[7] He was named Rickey Nelson Henley, after singer-actor Ricky Nelson,[8] and is the son of John L. Henley and Bobbie Henley.[8] When he was two years old, his father moved to Oakland, California. Rickey lived with his grandmother in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, from when he was two until he was seven, when he migrated to Oakland with his family. His father died in an automobile accident 10 years after leaving home.[9] His mother married Paul Henderson in Rickey Henley's junior year of high school and the family adopted the Henderson surname.[8] As a child learning to play baseball in Oakland, Henderson developed the ability to bat right-handed although he was a naturally left-handed thrower—a rare combination for baseball players, especially non-pitchers.[10] In the entire history of Major League Baseball through the 2008 season, only 57 position players are known to have batted right and thrown left, and Henderson is easily the most successful player to do so.[11] Henderson later said, \"All my friends were right-handed and swung from the right side, so I thought that's the way it was supposed to be done.\"[12] In 1976, Henderson graduated from Oakland Technical High School, where he played baseball, basketball and football, and was an All-American running back with two 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He also ran track, but did not stay with the team as the schedule conflicted with baseball.[13] Henderson received over a dozen scholarship offers to play football. Despite a childhood dream to play for the Oakland Raiders, he turned down the scholarships on the advice of his mother, who argued that football players had shorter careers.[13][14] Henderson was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the fourth round of the 1976 Major League Baseball draft.[15] He spent the first season of his minor league career with the Boise A's of the Northwest League. In 46 games, Henderson batted .336 and hit three home runs and two triples.[16] Henderson spent the following season with the Modesto A's. He batted .345 in 134 games during his record-setting season with Modesto. Henderson, along with Darrell Woodard, nearly broke the league record for team stolen bases. The Modesto A's finished the season with 357 stolen bases,[17] just shy of the league record of 370.[18] While Woodard tied the single-season player record with 90 stolen bases,[17] Henderson beat the record by stealing 95 bases, and was awarded the Sundial Trophy, given to the Modesto A's Most Valuable Player.[16][19] Henderson spent the 1978 season with the Jersey City A's of the Eastern League. After the minor league season ended, he played the 1978–1979 winter season for the Navojoa Mayos of the Mexican Pacific League. He played in six games for the team, which won its first championship.[20] In 1979, Henderson started the season with the Ogden A's of the Pacific Coast League. In 71 games for Ogden, he had a batting average of .309 and stole 44 bases.[16] Henderson made his major league debut with Oakland on June 24, 1979, getting two hits in four at-bats, along with a stolen base.[21] He batted .274 with 33 stolen bases in 89 games.[22] In 1980, Henderson became the third modern-era player to steal 100 bases in a season (Maury Wills 104 in 1962 and Lou Brock's 118 in 1974 had preceded him).[23] His 100 steals broke Eddie Collins' franchise record of 81 in 1910 with what were then the Philadelphia Athletics and set a new American League (AL) record, surpassing Ty Cobb's 96 set in 1915.[23] He also batted .303, had 179 hits (tied for ninth in AL), scored 111 runs (fourth in AL), drew 117 walks (second in AL), had a .420 on-base percentage (third in AL) and led the AL by reaching base 301 times.[citation needed] That winter, Henderson played in the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League; his 42 stolen bases broke that league's record as well.[24] Henderson was an MVP candidate a year later, in a season shortened by a players' strike. He hit .319, fourth in the AL, and led the league in hits (135), runs (89) and in steals (56). Henderson was also third in on-base percentage (.408), tied for second in triples (7), fourth in walks (64), eighth in total bases (185) and second in times reaching base (201). In so doing, he became the emblematic figure of Oakland manager Billy Martin's aggressive \"Billy Ball\" philosophy, which received much media attention.[25] Finishing second to the Milwaukee Brewers' Rollie Fingers in the MVP voting, Henderson's fielding that season also earned him his only Gold Glove Award. He later became known for his showboat \"snatch catches\", in which he would flick his glove out at incoming fly balls, then whip his arm behind his back after making the catch.[26] In 1982, Henderson broke Lou Brock's modern major league single season record by stealing 130 bases, a total which has not been approached since. He stole 84 bases by the All-Star break; no player has stolen as many as 84 bases in an entire season since 1988, when Henderson himself stole 93.[27] Henderson's 130 steals outpaced nine of the American League's 14 teams that season. He also led the AL in walks (116), was fourth in runs (119) and third in on-base percentage (.398).[citation needed] Inspired by Dodgers leadoff hitter Rudy Law, Henderson adopted an exaggerated crouch as his batting stance, which reduced his strike zone without sacrificing much power.[28] Sportswriter Jim Murray described Henderson's strike zone as being \"smaller than Hitler's heart\".[29] In 1982, he described his approach to Sports Illustrated: I found that if I squatted down real low at the plate ... I could see the ball better. I also knew it threw the pitcher off. I found that I could put my weight on my back foot and still turn my hips on the swing. I'm down so low I don't have much of a strike zone. Sometimes, walking so much even gets me mad. Last year Ed Ott of the Angels got so frustrated because the umpire was calling balls that would've been strikes on anybody else that he stood up and shouted at me, \"Stand up and hit like a man.\" I guess I do that to people.[30] Regarding Henderson's 1982 season, the mid-'80s book The Hidden Game of Baseball looked at such statistics as .78 expected runs with a runner on first and no outs, 1.07 expected runs with runner on second and no outs, and only .25 expected runs no one on and one out. The authors concluded that with Henderson's 130 stolen bases he contributed 22.2 runs to the A's offense. By being caught stealing 42 times, he cost his team 20.6 runs, and therefore, the authors concluded, the net effect of his running activity was merely 1.6 extra runs for the season.[31] A later analysis determined his net contribution was 5.3 runs for the season.[32] Henderson also made MLB history in 1983 with his third 100 runs/100 stolen bases/100 walks season (no modern player has done it once), when he led the AL in stolen bases (108), walks (103) while finishing fourth in runs scored (105). He was also second in on-base percentage (.414), tied for ninth in triples (7) and fifth in times on base, reaching 257 times.[citation needed] In 1984, Henderson hit 16 home runs while leading the league in stolen bases (66), finishing second in runs scored (113) and third in on-base-percentage (.399). After the season, he was traded to the New York Yankees.[33] As his muscular frame developed, Henderson continued to improve as a hitter. His increasing power-hitting ability eventually led to a record for home runs to lead off a game. During his career, he hit over 20 home runs in four different seasons, with a high of 28 in 1986 and again in 1990.[33] In December 1984, Henderson was traded to the New York Yankees along with Bert Bradley for five players: Tim Birtsas, Jay Howell, Stan Javier, Eric Plunk, and José Rijo.[33] In his first season with the Yankees, he led the league in runs scored (146) and stolen bases (80), was fourth in batting average (.314), walks (99) and on-base percentage (.419), seventh in slugging (.516), third in OPS (.934) and hit 24 home runs.[34] He also won the Silver Slugger Award, and was third in the voting for the MVP award. His 146 runs scored were the most since Ted Williams had 150 in 1950,[35] and he became the first player since Jimmie Foxx in 1939 to amass more runs scored than games played. Henderson became the first player in major league history to reach 80 stolen bases and 20 home runs in the 1985 season. He matched the feat in 1986, as did the Reds' Eric Davis; they remain the only players in major league history who are in the \"20/80 club\".[33][36] It was with the Yankees that Henderson, who had previously worn number 35 with Oakland, which was already taken by his Yankees teammate Phil Niekro, switched to his now famous 24, a number he would wear for the rest of his career (with two exceptions: (1) he briefly wore number 14 in 1993 while playing with the Blue Jays, (2) he wore his \"old\" number 35 in 2000 and 2002 while playing with the Mariners and the Red Sox, and (3) he wore number 25 while playing with the Dodgers).[citation needed] In 1986, he led the AL in runs scored (130) and stolen bases (87) for the second year in a row, and was seventh in walks (89) and extra base hits (64) while hitting 28 home runs (9 of which led off games) and had 74 RBIs.[37] In 1987, he had a below-average season by his standards, fueling criticism from the New York media, which had never covered Henderson or his eccentricities kindly.[38] Yankees owner George Steinbrenner issued a press release claiming that manager Lou Piniella wanted to trade Henderson for \"jaking it\" (playing lackadaisically).[39] Still, Henderson had his best on-base percentage to that point in his career (.423), with a .291 batting avg., was fifth in the AL in stolen bases (41) and hit 17 home runs despite playing only 95 games.[40] It was the only season from 1980 to 1991 in which Henderson did not lead the AL in steals. Seattle's Harold Reynolds led the league with 60 steals; Reynolds tells the story of getting an impish phone call from Henderson after the season: The phone rings. 'Henderson here.' I say, 'Hey, what's going on, Rickey?' I think he's calling to congratulate me, but he goes, 'Sixty stolen bases? You ought to be ashamed. Rickey would have 60 at the break.' And then click, he hung up.\"[7] In 1988, Henderson led the AL in steals (93), was third in runs scored (118), fifth in OBP (.394) and seventh in walks (82), while hitting .305.[33] Though only in New York for 4+1⁄2 seasons, Henderson set the Yankees' franchise record with 326 stolen bases; the previous high (248) had been held by Hal Chase, who last played for the Yankees in 1913, when the team was still known as the Highlanders. On May 28, 2011, Henderson's total was surpassed by Derek Jeter,[41] who by that point had already played 1,700 more games as a Yankee than Henderson.[42] On June 21, 1989, the Yankees traded Henderson back to Oakland for Plunk, Greg Cadaret, and Luis Polonia.[43] After the trade, his 52 steals and 72 runs scored led the Athletics into the postseason;[33] his 126 walks for the year were the most for any AL hitter since 1970. With a record eight steals in five games, he was named MVP of the American League Championship Series; he hit .400 while scoring eight runs and delivering two home runs, five runs batted in (RBIs), seven walks and a 1.000 slugging percentage. Leading the Athletics to a four-game sweep over the San Francisco Giants and the franchise's first World Series title since 1974, Henderson hit .474 with an .895 slugging average (including two triples and a homer), while stealing three more bases.[33] On August 22, 1989, he became Nolan Ryan's 5,000th strikeout victim, but Henderson took an odd delight in the occurrence, saying, \"If you haven't been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you're nobody.\"[44] A year later, Henderson finished second in the league in batting average with a mark of .325, losing out to the Kansas City Royals' George Brett on the final day of the season. Henderson had a remarkably consistent season, with his batting average falling below .320 for only one game, the third of the year. Reaching safely by a hit or a walk in 125 of his 136 games, he led the league in runs (119), stolen bases (65), on-base percentage (.439) and OPS (1.016) was second in slugging percentage (.577), fourth in walks (97) and extra base hits (66), sixth in home runs (28) and total bases (282) and had 61 RBIs. Henderson won the AL's MVP award and helped Oakland to another pennant. He again performed well in the World Series (.333 batting, .667 slugging, a home run and three steals in four games), but the A's were swept by the underdog Cincinnati Reds.[45] On May 1, 1991, Henderson broke one of baseball's most noted records when he stole the 939th base of his career, one more than Lou Brock's total compiled from 1961 to 1979, mainly with the St. Louis Cardinals.[46][47] On July 16, 1993, Henderson broke the world stolen base record by stealing his 1,066th base, thus going past the record which was previously held by Yutaka Fukumoto. In 90 games with Oakland, he was batting .327 (second in AL) with 17 home runs and 47 RBIs. He also had scored 77 runs, stolen 31 bases, drew 85 walks, had a .469 on-base percentage and was slugging .553. In July 1993, the Athletics traded Henderson to the playoff-bound Toronto Blue Jays for Steve Karsay and José Herrera.[33] He performed disappointingly for the Jays, hitting only .215 in 44 games, which was probably due to the fact that he fractured a bone on his hand early on with the team, after being hit by a pitch, although he still contributed 22 stolen bases and 37 runs scored. However, his hitting woes continued in the post-season, batting .120 in the American League Championship Series and .227 in the World Series. Nevertheless, Henderson was involved in the final play of the World Series that year. He and Paul Molitor scored on Joe Carter's Series-ending home run, one of the most famous moments in baseball history.[48] After the 1993 season, Henderson re-signed as a free agent with Oakland in December 1993.[33] In 1994 and 1995, Henderson finished in the top 10 in the league in walks, steals and on-base percentage.[33] His .300 average in 1995 marked his sixth and final season in the AL with a .300 or better average.[citation needed] Henderson signed with the San Diego Padres in the offseason. In 1996, he again finished in the top ten in the National League (NL) in walks, OBP, steals and runs.[49] On August 13, 1997, the Padres traded Henderson to the Anaheim Angels for minor leaguers Ryan Hancock and Stevenson Agosto, as well as a player to be named later.[50] The Padres acquired George Arias to complete the trade.[51] As an Angel, Henderson batted only .183 for the rest of the season.[citation needed] In January 1998, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Athletics, the fourth time he played for the franchise.[33] That season he led the majors in stolen bases (66) and the AL in walks (118), while scoring 101 runs.[33] In so doing, the 39-year-old became the oldest player to lead a league in stolen bases, and the oldest player to reach 50 steals.[52] A year later, Henderson signed as a free agent with the New York Mets. In 1999, he batted .315 with 37 steals and was seventh in the NL in on-base percentage.[53] Henderson was voted the 1999 National League comeback player of the year by The Sporting News. He wore number 24, which—although not officially retired—had not been regularly worn by a Mets player since Willie Mays' retirement in 1973. Nonetheless, Henderson and the Mets were an uneasy fit. Following the Mets' loss in the 1999 NLCS, the New York press made much of a card game between Henderson and Bobby Bonilla. Both players had been substituted out of the lineup, and they reportedly left the dugout before the playoff game had concluded.[54] Henderson sought a raise on his $1.9 million salary for the 2000 season, but the Mets refused to renegotiate. He also feuded with manager Bobby Valentine and complained about traveling to Tokyo for the 2000 season opening series against the Chicago Cubs. Henderson batted .219 with no home runs and two RBIs before the Mets put him on waivers and granted him his release in May.[55][56] After his release from the Mets, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Seattle Mariners.[57] In his second game as a Mariner, on May 20, Henderson hit a leadoff home run, thus becoming the third player to hit a home run in four different decades (Ted Williams and Willie McCovey were the others).[58] Despite starting the season in the National League, Henderson finished fourth in the AL in stolen bases (31).[59] A free agent in March 2001, Henderson returned to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's record of 2,062 career walks,[49] Ty Cobb's record of 2,245 career runs,[60] and Zack Wheat's record of 2,328 career games in left field, and on the final day of the season (October 7) collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson in San Diego.[61][62] That final game was also Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play.[63] After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup. At the age of 42, in his last substantial major league season, Henderson finished the year with 25 stolen bases, ninth in the NL;[33] it also marked his 23rd consecutive season with more than 20 steals.[33] Of the ten top base stealers who were still active as of 2002, the other nine each stole fewer bases in 2002 than the 42-year-old Henderson.[64] In February 2002, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox, where at age 43 he became the oldest player to play center field in major league history when he replaced Johnny Damon for three games in April and another in July. Henderson's arrival was marked by a statistical oddity. During the 22+1⁄2 years from his June 1979 debut through the end of the 2001 season, he had stolen more bases by himself than his new team had: 1,395 steals for Henderson, 1,382 for the Boston franchise. The Red Sox finally \"passed\" Henderson on April 30, 2002. At age 43, Henderson was the oldest player in the American League.[65] While playing in Boston, Henderson wore his old number 35, as his regular number 24 was already taken by Red Sox teammate Manny Ramirez.[citation needed] As the 2003 season began, Henderson was without a team for the first time in his career. He played in the independent Atlantic League with the Newark Bears, hoping for a chance with another major league organization.[66][67] After being named the Atlantic League All-Star Game MVP and receiving much media attention, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed him over the All-Star break. In 30 games with the Dodgers, he had 15 hits and three stolen bases, with a .208 batting average.[citation needed] Before the 2003 season, his last in the majors, Henderson discussed his reputation for hanging onto his lengthy baseball career: Each and every day I set a record, but we never talk about it. We'll talk about a home run hitter 24/7. Well, they haven't broken any all-time records, but they hit homers, and that's what matters nowadays. You continue playing, you accomplish a lot, and you'd think people would look at it as a fantastic career. Instead, Rickey thinks people want Rickey to quit more than anything.\"[68] Henderson played his last major league game on September 19, 2003; he was hit by a pitch in his only plate appearance, and came around to score his 2,295th run. Though it became increasingly unlikely that he would return, he continued to publicly debate his own official retirement.[69] After leaving the Dodgers, Henderson started his second consecutive season with the Newark Bears in May 2004.[70] In 91 games he had a .462 OBP, with more than twice as many walks (96) as strikeouts (41), and stole 37 bases while being caught only twice.[16] On May 9, 2005, Henderson signed with the San Diego Surf Dawgs of the Golden Baseball League, an independent league. This was the Surf Dawgs' and the Golden Baseball League's inaugural season, and Henderson helped the team to the league championship. In 73 games he had a .456 OBP, with 73 walks while striking out 43 times, and 16 steals while being caught only twice.[71] It would be his final professional season. Henderson would not accept the end of his major league career. In May 2005, he was still insisting that he was capable of playing in the major leagues. NBC and ESPN reported that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but his agent denied the report the following day. On February 10, 2006, he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets, while leaving the door open to returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he'd received to rejoin the Surf Dawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he'd had enough. Six weeks later, though, on August 11, he claimed \"It's sort of weird not to be playing, but I decided to take a year off\", adding, \"I can't say I will retire. My heart is still in it ... I still love the game right now, so I'm going to wait it out and see what happens.\"[72] On May 18, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided it did not \"infringe on the integrity of the roster or of the season\", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player.[73] A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, \"One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot ... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum—and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody? ... Don't say goodbye for me ... When I want that one day they want to give me so bad, I'll let you know.\"[74] The Athletics retired Henderson's #24 on August 1, 2009.[75] Henderson finally conceded his \"official retirement\" on July 13, 2007: \"I haven't submitted retirement papers to MLB, but I think MLB already had their papers that I was retired.\" Characteristically, he added, \"If it was a situation where we were going to win the World Series and I was the only player that they had left, I would put on the shoes.\"[76] Contrary to speculation,[77][78][79] Henderson's refusal to officially retire had not been delaying his eligibility for Hall of Fame induction. Since the 1970s, the five-year waiting period has been based on major league service only. Henderson was elected as part of the 2009 Hall of Fame vote, in his first appearance on the ballot. At a press conference two days after his election, the 50-year-old Henderson told reporters, \"I believe today, and people say I'm crazy, but if you gave me as many at-bats that you would give the runners out there today, I would outsteal every last one of them ... they can always ring my phone and I'll come on down and help their ballclub, that's how much I love the game.\"[80] In 2011, on the 20th anniversary of his record-breaking stolen base, the Oakland A's held \"Rickey Henderson Bobblehead Day.\" At Henderson's insistence, the giveaway plastic dolls had one atypical modification: \"I told them, put a little dirt on mine, make sure that [it looks] like I'm playing the game.\" Almost eight years after his final game, Henderson also reiterated his desire to return: \"Sometimes when I sit around and look at the game and things ain't going right, I just think, 'Just let me put on the uniform and go out there and take a chance'.\"[81] The New York Mets hired Henderson as a special instructor in 2006, primarily to work with hitters and to teach base stealing. Henderson's impact was noticeable on José Reyes, the Mets' former leadoff hitter.[82] \"I always want to be around the game,\" Henderson said in May 2007. \"That's something that's in my blood. Helping them have success feels just as good.\"[83] On July 13, 2007, the Mets promoted Henderson from special instructor to first base coach, replacing Howard Johnson, who became the hitting coach.[84] Henderson was not retained as a coach for 2008. Henderson had periodically been a special instructor in the Athletics' spring training camps. In 2010, he worked on base stealing (most notably with Rajai Davis and Coco Crisp) and outfield drills.[85] Sports Illustrated's Tom Verducci wrote in 2003, \"There are certain figures in American history who have passed into the realm of cultural mythology, as if reality could no longer contain their stories: Johnny Appleseed. Wild Bill Hickok. Davy Crockett. Rickey Henderson. They exist on the sometimes narrow margin between Fact and Fiction.\"[86] Henderson notably referred to himself in the third-person.[87][88] According to Verducci, during one off-season, Henderson called Padres general manager Kevin Towers and left this message: \"Kevin, this is Rickey. Calling on behalf of Rickey. Rickey wants to play baseball.\"[29] However, Henderson denied that this happened in a February 26, 2009, interview on Mike and Mike in the Morning.[89] In 2003, he discussed his unusual phraseology, saying, \"People are always saying, 'Rickey says Rickey.' But it's been blown way out of proportion. Rickey says it when Rickey doesn't do what Rickey needs to be doing. Rickey uses it to remind himself, like, 'Rickey, what you doing, you stupid. ... ' Rickey's just scolding himself.\"[68] Henderson did use the first person pronoun on occasion, such as when he defended his position during a contract dispute: \"All I'm asking for is what I want.\"[29] Henderson was so proud of a $1 million signing bonus that he framed it instead of cashing it, thus losing several months' interest.[90] Similarly, Henderson refused to spend his per diem money that all players receive on road trips: instead, he would put the envelopes containing the cash in a box, and when one of his children performed well in school he would invite them to choose an envelope out of the box and keep its contents. In 2002, following an argument with pitcher Orlando Hernández, Henderson stated, \"He needs to grow up a little bit. I ain't a kid. When I broke into the game, he was crawling on his hands and knees. Unless he's as old as I am. He probably is.\" (Hernández is approximately seven years younger.)[91] There are many unconfirmed stories about Henderson. A Padres teammate (variously reported as Steve Finley or Tony Gwynn) once offered him a seat anywhere on the bus, saying that Henderson had tenure. Henderson supposedly replied, \"Ten years? What are you talking about? Rickey got 16, 17 years.\"[92] One widely reported story was a fabrication that began as a clubhouse joke made by a visiting player.[92] While playing for Seattle in 2000, Henderson was said to have commented on first baseman John Olerud's practice of wearing a batting helmet while playing defense, noting that a former teammate in Toronto did the same thing. Olerud was reported to have replied, \"That was me.\" The two men had been together the previous season with the 1999 Mets, as well as with the 1993 World Champion Blue Jays. Several news outlets originally reported the story as fact.[93][94][95] Verducci wrote, \"Rickey is the modern-day Yogi Berra, only faster.\" Henderson himself was resigned to his persona: \"A lot of stuff they had me doing or something they said I had created, it's comedy. I guess that's how they want to judge me, as a character.\"[86] In 1983, Henderson married his high-school sweetheart, Pamela. They had three children: Angela, Alexis, and Adrianna.[12] Following a bout of pneumonia, Henderson died on December 20, 2024, five days before his 66th birthday.[96][97] He had been a patient at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.[98] It took a long time, huh [Pause for cheers] First of all, I would like to thank God for giving me the opportunity. I want to thank the Haas family, the Oakland organization, the city of Oakland, and all you beautiful fans for supporting me. [Pause for cheers] Most of all, I'd like to thank my mom, my friends, and loved ones for their support. I want to give my appreciation to Tom Trebelhorn and the late Billy Martin. Billy Martin was a great manager. He was a great friend to me. I love you, Billy. I wish you were here. [Pause for cheers] Lou Brock was the symbol of great base stealing. But today, I'm the greatest of all time. Thank you. On May 1, 1991, Henderson stole his 939th base to pass Lou Brock and became the sport's all-time stolen base leader.[46] Henderson's speech after breaking Brock's record was similar to the standard victory or award speech. He thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. Because his idol was Muhammad Ali, Henderson decided to use the words \"greatest of all time.\"[100] These words have since been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant,[101] although years later, Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock, and the Cardinals Hall of Famer \"had no problem with it. In fact, he helped me write what I was going to say that day.\"[102] On the day of the speech, Brock later told reporters amiably, \"He spoke from his heart.\" Brock and Henderson had had a friendly relationship ever since their first meeting in 1981. Brock pronounced the young speedster as the heir to his record, saying, \"How are we gonna break it?\"[7] Henderson has mixed feelings about his comments: As soon as I said it, it ruined everything. Everybody thought it was the worst thing you could ever say. Those words haunt me to this day, and will continue to haunt me. They overshadow what I've accomplished in this game.[68] At the end of his July 2009 Hall of Fame induction, Henderson alluded to his earlier speech, saying:[citation needed] In closing, I would like to say my favorite hero was Muhammad Ali. He said at one time, quote, 'I am the greatest,' end of quote. That is something I always wanted to be. And now that the Association has voted me into the Baseball Hall of Fame, my journey as a player is complete. I am now in the class of the greatest players of all time. And at this moment, I am ... [pause] ... very, very humble. Thank you. Asked if he believes the passage of time will improve his reputation, Henderson said: If you talk about baseball, you can't eliminate me, because I'm all over baseball ... It's the truth. Telling the truth isn't being cocky. What do you want me to say, that I didn't put up the numbers? That my teams didn't win a lot of games? People don't want me to say anything about what I've done. Then why don't you say it? Because if I don't say it and you don't say it, nobody says it.[68] Henderson had 468 more stolen bases in his career than Brock, one short of 50% more than the game's second-most prolific basestealer.[103] In 1993, Henderson stole his 1,066th base, surpassing the world record established ten years earlier by Yutaka Fukumoto for the Hankyu Braves in Japan's Pacific League.[104] In his prime, Henderson had a virtual monopoly on the stolen base title in the American League. Between 1980 and 1991, he led the league in steals every season except 1987,[105] when he missed part of the season due to a nagging hamstring injury,[106] allowing Mariners second baseman Harold Reynolds to win the title. Henderson had one more league-leading season after that stretch, when his 66 steals in 1998 made him the oldest steals leader in baseball history. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Henderson also owns the record for times caught stealing (335). Due to incomplete historical recordkeeping for that statistic, though, it is unknown whether he is the actual career leader.[107] However, Henderson's overall 81% success rate on the basepaths is among the highest percentages in history.[108] (Carlos Beltran ranks first among players with at least 300 career attempts, at just over 86%.)[109] On July 29, 1989, Henderson stole five bases against the Mariners' left-handed Randy Johnson, his career high, and one shy of the single-game major league record. Unusually, Henderson was hitless in the game (he had four walks). Henderson had 18 four-steal games during his career. In August 1983, in a three-game series against the Brewers and a 2-game series versus the Yankees, Henderson had 13 stolen bases in five games. Baltimore Orioles third baseman Floyd Rayford described the confusion he felt during a particular game, when Henderson was leading off first base and signaling him with two fingers. Henderson quickly stole second base, then third, and Rayford understood the gesture.[29] Longtime scout Charlie Metro remembered the havoc caused by Henderson: '\"I did a lot of study and I found that it's impossible to throw Rickey Henderson out. I started using stopwatches and everything. I found it was impossible to throw some other guys out also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it.\"[110] Joe Posnanski of the Kansas City Star and Sports Illustrated wrote: I'm about to give you one of my all-time favorite statistics: Rickey Henderson walked 796 times in his career LEADING OFF AN INNING. Think about this again. There would be nothing, absolutely nothing, a pitcher would want to avoid more than walking Rickey Henderson to lead off an inning. And yet he walked SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX times to lead off an inning. He walked more times just leading off in an inning than Lou Brock, Roberto Clemente, Luis Aparicio, Ernie Banks, Kirby Puckett, Ryne Sandberg and more than 50 other Hall of Famers walked in their entire careers ... I simply cannot imagine a baseball statistic more staggering.[111] Henderson was a headfirst slider. In September 2008, Henderson discussed his base-stealing technique at length with Sports Illustrated: I wanted to know how to dive into the base because I was getting strawberries on my knees and strawberries on my ass ... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [low-to-the-ground] technique from airplanes ... I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding ... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take ... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think.[112] Padres closer Trevor Hoffman said, \"I don't know how to put into words how fortunate I was to spend time around one of the icons of the game. I can't comprehend that yet. Years from now, though, I'll be able to say I played with Rickey Henderson, and I imagine it will be like saying I played with Babe Ruth.\"[29] When Henderson was 44 years old and playing for the Newark Bears in 2003, Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, \"I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.' ... I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody ... We've had some special players come through San Diego. But there's an aura about him nobody else has.\"[29] Tony La Russa, Henderson's manager in the late 1980s in Oakland, said, \"He rises to the occasion—the big moment—better than anybody I've ever seen.\"[29] Coach Rene Lachemann said, \"If you're one run down, there's nobody you'd ever rather have up at the plate than Rickey.\" Teammate Mitchell Page said, \"It wasn't until I saw Rickey that I understood what baseball was about. Rickey Henderson is a run, man. That's it. When you see Rickey Henderson, I don't care when, the score's already 1–0. If he's with you, that's great. If he's not, you won't like it.\"[25] A's pitching coach Dave Duncan said of Henderson, \"You have to be careful because he can knock one out. But you don't want to be too careful because he's got a small strike zone and you can't afford to walk him. And that's only half the problem. When he gets on base he's more trouble still.\" Sportswriter Tom Verducci wrote, \"Baseball is designed to be an egalitarian sort of game in which one player among the 18 is not supposed to dominate ... Yet in the past quarter-century Henderson and Barry Bonds have come closest to dominating a baseball game the way Michael Jordan could a basketball game.\"[86] In July 2007, New York Sun sportswriter Tim Marchman wrote about Henderson's accomplishments: He stole all those bases and scored all those runs and played all those years not because of his body, but because of his brain. Rickey could tell from the faintest, most undetectable twitch of a pitcher's muscles whether he was going home or throwing over to first. He understood that conditioning isn't about strength, but about flexibility. And more than anyone else in the history of the game, he understood that baseball is entirely a game of discipline — the discipline to work endless 1–1 counts your way, the discipline to understand that your job is to get on base, and the discipline to understand that the season is more important than the game, and a career more important than the season. Maybe he'd get a bit more credit for all this if he were some boring drip like Cal Ripken Jr., blathering on endlessly about humility and apple pie and tradition and whatever else, but we're all better off with things the way they are ... Everyone had their fun when he broke Lou Brock's stolen base record and proclaimed, 'I am the greatest', but he was, of course, just saying what was plainly true.\"[113] As of 2021[update], Henderson ranks first all-time in runs scored (2,295) and stolen bases (1,406), fourth in career games played (3,081), 13th in at bats (10,961), and 25th in hits (3,055). He has the second-highest career power–speed number, behind Barry Bonds, at 490.4.[114][115] His record for most career walks (2,190) has since been broken by Barry Bonds; Henderson is now second but continues to hold the record for most unintentional walks (2,129).[citation needed] While his career batting average of .279 is considered somewhat modest for a leadoff hitter, his walks helped him post a stout .401 on-base percentage (OBP) for his career. He posted an OBP of at least .400 in 16 separate seasons, with a high mark of .439 in his 1990 MVP season. Henderson averaged 115 walks per 162 games over his career.[citation needed] Henderson also holds the record for most home runs to lead off a game, with 81; George Springer places a distant second with 56 career lead-off home runs. During the 2003 season, Henderson surpassed Babe Ruth for the career record in secondary bases (total bases compiled from extra base hits, walks, stolen bases, and times hit by pitch). In 1993, he led off both games of a doubleheader with homers. At the time of his last major league game, Henderson was still in the all-time top 100 home run hitters, with 297. Bill James wrote in 2000, \"Without exaggerating one inch, you could find fifty Hall of Famers who, all taken together, don't own as many records, and as many important records, as Rickey Henderson.\"[116] Henderson's eight steals during the 1989 ALCS broke Lou Brock's postseason record for a single series.[117][118] His record for the most postseason stolen bases was broken by Kenny Lofton's 34th career steal during the 2007 ALCS;[119] however, Lofton accomplished his total in 95 postseason games compared to Henderson's 60.[33][120] Henderson is the only American League player to steal more than 100 bases in a single season (having accomplished the feat three times), and he is the all-time stolen base leader for the Oakland A's.[33][121] In 1999, before breaking the career records for runs scored and walks, Henderson was ranked number 51 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,[122] and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[123] In 2005, The Sporting News updated their 100 Greatest Players list, and Henderson had inched up to number 50.[124] On January 12, 2009, Henderson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot, receiving 94.8% of the vote.[68] This was the 13th highest percentage in major league history.[125] Asked to choose the best player in history, Henderson declined, saying, \"There are guys who have done different things very well, but I don't know of anyone who mastered everything.\" Offered the chance to assess his own placement among the game's greats, he said, \"I haven't mastered the homers or RBI. The little things, I probably mastered.\" Of his various records and achievements, he values his career-runs-scored mark the most: \"You have to score to win.\"[126] Italics denotes active player",

                "content": "Statement from Pamela Henderson It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of my husband, Rickey Henderson. A legend on and off the field, Rickey was a devoted son, dad, friend, grandfather, brother, uncle, and a truly humble soul. Rickey lived his life with integrity, and his love for baseball was paramount. Now, Rickey is at peace with the Lord, cherishing the extraordinary moments and achievements he leaves behind. We are deeply grateful for the outpouring of love, support, and heartfelt memories from family, friends, and fans — all of which have brought immense comfort. We also extend our sincere gratitude to MLB, the Oakland A's, and the incredible doctors and nurses at UCSF who cared for Rickey with dedication and compassion. Your prayers and kindness mean more than words can express. In this difficult time, we kindly ask for your respect and privacy as we adjust to life without Rickey, holding on to the legacy he left for all of us. With gratitude,Pamela Henderson and his daughters Statement from the A’s Rickey Henderson is one of the greatest baseball players of all time. His on-field accomplishments speak for themselves, and his records will forever stand atop baseball history. He was undoubtedly the most legendary player in Oakland history and made an indelible mark on generations of A’s fans over his 14 seasons wearing the Green and Gold. For those who knew him personally, Rickey was much more than a franchise icon and a Baseball Hall of Famer. He was a friend and mentor to every player, coach, and employee who passed through the Oakland Coliseum or played a game on the field that came to bear his name. We are shocked and heartbroken by his passing. His loss will be felt not only by A’s fans but also by baseball fans around the world. The entire A's organization sends its sincere condolences to Rickey’s family and loved ones at this time. Statement from A’s Owner John Fisher Rickey was one of a kind. I’m shocked and deeply saddened by his passing, knowing we will no longer see this humble, smiling, and always approachable legend at Spring Training or in the clubhouse. He symbolized everything that is great about baseball and his hometown team, the Oakland Athletics. As Billy Beane shared with me, \"At 65, Rickey still looked ready to put on his uniform and lead off.\" I will miss him. My deepest condolences to his wife, daughters, family, and friends. Statement from A’s Senior Advisor to the Managing Partner Billy Beane Rickey was a teammate, a competitor, and someone I was lucky enough to work alongside and ultimately call a friend. He was the greatest Oakland A of all time and will deservedly be remembered that way by fans of baseball across the world. His impact on the A's, on Oakland, and on baseball is immeasurable, as he continued to affect the lives and careers of A's players and staff until the very end. My condolences go out, first and foremost, to his family for their loss, and to everyone who knew and admired Rickey. He will be greatly missed. Statement from A’s President Dave Kaval Rickey was a true original. One of the greats. He lived life the same way he played baseball, with a joy that inspired others. I was blessed to have him as a friend. I, like so many others, will miss him dearly. Statement from A’s Manager Mark Kotsay It was just an honor to wear the same uniform and to have him alongside us in the dugout and on the field. Rickey’s presence was felt everywhere in our clubhouse, and it’s hard to imagine the A’s without him around.",

                "title": "Stolen base king Rickey Henderson dies at 65",
                "content": "Print Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson, who shattered stolen base records and redefined baseball's leadoff position, has died. He was 65. Henderson died on Friday. The Athletics said Saturday they were \"shocked and heartbroken by his passing,\" but did not specify a cause of death. Known as baseball's \"Man of Steal,\" Henderson had a lengthy list of accolades and accomplishments over his 25-year career — an MVP, 10 All-Star selections, two World Series titles and a Gold Glove award. But it was stealing bases where Henderson made his name and dominated the sport like no other. He broke through with 100 steals in his first full season in the majors in 1980, topping Ty Cobb's AL single-season record with the Oakland Athletics. He barely slowed, playing for nine franchises over the next two decades. He broke Lou Brock's single-season record of 118 by stealing 130 bases in 1982 and led the league in steals for seven straight seasons and 12 overall. He broke Brock's career record when he stole his 939th base on May 1, 1991, for Oakland. He famously pulled third base out of the ground and showed it off to the adoring crowd before giving a speech that he capped by saying: \"Lou Brock was a great base stealer, but today I am the greatest of all time.\" Henderson finished his career with 1,406 steals, a 468-steal edge over Brock. Henderson said in September he would have had many more steals in his career and in the record-breaking 1982 season if rules introduced in 2023 to limit pickoff throws and increase the size of bases had overlapped with his career. \"If I was playing today, I would get 162, right now, without a doubt,\" he said. Henderson’s accomplishment that record-breaking day in 1991 was slightly overshadowed that night when Nolan Ryan threw his record seventh career no-hitter. Henderson had been Ryan’s 5,000th career strikeout victim, which led him to say, \"If you haven’t been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you’re nobody.\" That was clearly not the case for Henderson. He is also the career leader in runs scored with 2,295 and in leadoff home runs with 81, ranks second to Barry Bonds with 2,190 walks and is fourth in games played (3,081) and plate appearances (13,346). He finished his career with 3,055 hits over 25 seasons spent with Oakland, the New York Yankees, Toronto, San Diego, Anaheim, the New York Mets, Seattle, Boston and the Los Angeles Dodgers. He fittingly finished his career with the Dodgers at age 44 in 2003 by scoring a run in his final play on a major league field. Henderson is the third prominent baseball Hall of Famer with ties to the Bay Area who died this year, following the deaths in June of former Giants stars Willie Mays and Orlando Cepeda. Henderson was the rare position player who batted from the right side and threw with his left arm — but then again, everything about Henderson was unique. He batted out of an extreme crouch, making for a tighter strike zone that contributed to his high walk total. He struck fear in opponents with his aggressive leads off first, his fingers twitching between his legs as he eyed the pitcher and the next base. Born on Christmas Day in 1958 in Chicago in the back of his parents' Chevy, Henderson grew up in Oakland and developed into a star athlete. He played baseball, basketball and football at Oakland Tech High School and was a highly sought-after football recruit who could have played tailback at Southern California, where he could have played eventually with football Hall of Famer Marcus Allen. But Henderson said his mother loved baseball and thought it would be the safer career in a decision that proved to be prescient. \"She didn’t want her baby to get hurt,\" Henderson told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2019. \"I was mad, but she was smart. Overall, with the career longevity and the success I had, she made the right decision. Some of the players in football now have short careers and they can barely move around when they’re done.\"",

The Oaklandside is committed to telling stories about what’s beautiful in Oakland as well as the city’s systemic problems, their root causes and possible solutions. Will you donate to our year-end fundraising campaign to support our reporting? Rickey Henderson, considered by baseball experts, including journalists and fellow players, as one of the greatest to ever play the game, died Friday, Dec. 20 at the age of 65. Henderson moved to Oakland with his family when he was 7 years old and grew up on 61st and Dover streets near Bushrod Park. He attended Oakland Technical High School, where he played football and baseball. In 1976, as an Oakland Tech senior, he was named “California State Baseball Player of the Year” while also playing football and running track. Multiple sources confirmed Henderson’s passing to The Oaklandside. His death, which led to hours of speculation on social media, was also confirmed by the East Bay Times. Henderson started in the major league with the Athletics in 1979 and played in the big leagues for 24 years, setting records that will likely never be matched. Among them are stolen bases. Henderson electrified fans with 1,406 stolen bases, 50% more than the number of bases stolen by the player in second place, Lou Brock. He was also considered the greatest leadoff hitter of all time, with the most home runs leading off a game, 81, and an uncanny ability to get on base. And coaches and fellow players relied on him as a consistent scorer with the most runs – the core statistic of baseball. Henderson tapped home base 2,295 times in his day. Never miss a story. Sign up for The Oaklandside’s free daily newsletter. Δ Perhaps most incredibly from the perspective of the sentimental, storytelling nature of the game, Henderson played for his hometown team in Oakland, the Athletics, for the majority of his career. Although he had several stints in other cities, including a long and fanciful stretch with the New York Yankees, it was in Oakland where he enthralled fans. Oakland remained his home after he retired. Affectionately known as “The Man of Steal,” Henderson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009 alongside Jim Rice, another ballplayer who came of age in the late 70s and 80s. The number “24” was retired by the Athletics the same year. In his induction speech, Henderson thanked a long list of coaches, teammates, and his family. Poignantly, he spoke with emotion about the role that his mother, Bobbie Henderson played in his upbringing and how she pushed him to be the best player he could be. In 2006, the Oakland Unified School District decommissioned the playground of the former Carter Middle School in North Oakland. Shortly after, neighbors, community leaders, parents of Oakland Tech students and alumni formed the “Field of Dreams Committee.” A year later, the field became a common venue for Oakland Tech and local sports nonprofits. In 2009, it was renamed as the “Rickey Henderson Field.” Henderson spoke at the renaming ceremony, saying, “Maybe now local youths might become more involved with baseball, allowing them to pursue and realize their own dreams much as a teenage Rickey Henderson did so many years ago.” In 2017, the Athletics renamed the Oakland Coliseum’s field “Rickey Henderson Field” to honor the Oakland legend and Hall of Famer. “It’s almost too hard to believe that in 2024, the final year [of the A’s] in Oakland, #24 would no longer be with us,” Bryan Johansen, co-founder of the baseball fan group The Last Dive Bar, and one of the first to announce the news of Henderson’s passing, told the Oaklandside. “He was and will always be the greatest of all time. I’m absolutely heartbroken.” One of Henderson’s last public appearances was at the final Athletics game at the Oakland Coliseum. Henderson and Dave Stewart threw the last ceremonial pitch. They wore the team’s beloved kelly green “Oakland” jersey. The two Oakland natives grew up playing on local dirt playgrounds and won a championship together in 1989 in the earthquake-rattled classic series against crosstown rivals, the San Francisco Giants. “The fans came out here today to remember all the great times they’ve had,” Henderson told The Oaklandside at the last game. “This is a special day. We are all here today together once again.” Besides his spectacular achievements on the field, Henderson was known for his offbeat personality, sprinkled with an Oakland-type of dry, chill humor. Over the years, hundreds of players told anecdotes of Rickey interactions later defined as “Rickeyisms” — hard to believe, partly true, and always entertaining. One story involved Toronto Blue Jays first baseman John Olerud meeting Rickey at first base. Olerud, who uncommonly wore a helmet on the field as a precaution after suffering an aneurism in college, played with Henderson in the early 1990s in the Canadian city. They even won a championship together. Rickey apparently smiled at him and guilelessly told Olerud, “You know, I used to play with a guy who wore a helmet on the field, too!” Olerud said, “Rickey, that was me.” Sometimes, his statements and actions didn’t go over well. Over the years, including during his time with the A’s, Henderson sometimes clashed with his managers, notably Hall of Famers Billy Martin in Oakland and New York and Tony La Russa in Oakland. La Russa, the long-time A’s boss, criticized Henderson during contract negotiations in 1992 and publicly called him out other times for not being a team player. Henderson disputed this by speaking about himself in the not-quite-so-selfless third person, saying, charmingly, that “Rickey is a team player.” La Russa, for his part, often let Rickey do what he wanted on the field. During the team’s high-flying seasons in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he famously said he didn’t give Rickey any running signs. “He had the green light,” La Russa told reporters. Henderson had enough opportunities to define himself as a singular player during one of the game’s most popular eras. His performance in the 1989 playoffs, following a re-acquisition by the A’s during the summer trade deadline, was sublime, with Sports Illustrated reporter Peter Gammons saying his output during the American League Championship Series “may go down as the best individual performance since the playoff system began in 1969.” Rickey led all players in that series in runs, slugging, homers, on-base percentage, total bases, steals, walks, “and conversations with fans,” Gammons wrote. He also commonly taunted the Jays players, calling his two-homer performance the day before it happened. Henderson also set the standard for professional financial independence. On November 28, 1989, he signed a four-year contract with Oakland worth $12 million, then a record for the sport. At the Athletics last game in September, Henderson signed autographs and chatted with fans. He embraced Athletics player, Max Schuemann and other current players and joked around with Dave Stewart. As news of his passing first circulated Friday night, long-time Henderson, A’s, and baseball fans everywhere mourned the Oakland baseball legend. “I used to cut out the daily stolen base counts from the paper the year you broke Lou Brock’s record. You were my first sports hero!” read one tweet from a fan in the Philippines. “Rickey Henderson has been a part of my marriage for 31 yrs. I promised the hubby no matter how broke we were, we would be in Cooperstown when he was inducted. We were. We sat in 134 in honor of the greatest player I ever had the honor to watch play the game,” read another tweet. Henderson is survived by his wife, Pamela, and three children: Angela, Alexis, and Adrianna. We rely on readers like you to keep local journalism thriving in Oakland.

Houston Texans wide receiver Tank Dell suffered a significant knee injury while coming down with a touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs on Saturday. As Dell hauled in a pass from quarterback C.J.

He was brought to University of Kansas Medical Center at a level one trauma center, 12 miles from Arrowhead, according to the NBC broadcast. After the game, head coach DeMeco Ryans provided an update on the wide receiver, saying Dell will remain in the Kansas City hospital overnight for further evaluation of the \"significant\" knee injury. \"Just all our thoughts and prayers are with Tank right now ... it hurts to see him go down like that.

It's not easy, but I try to use that as motivation,\" he said. \"It's not easy to just let it go, especially that's my best friend. Not easy to move on and just keep playing, but I try to do as best as I could.

Stroud struggles to find words when talking about the Tank Dell injury. “We serve a miraculous God…”“I’m tore up but I gotta be strong for him.” pic.twitter.com/BiVfjNfm8k The medical staff stabilized Dell's entire left leg in a vacuum splint, which is used when there's concern about severe instability or fracture. It stabilizes from the hip to the foot. The team then quickly ruled him out with a knee injury. His teammates, including Stroud, were seen praying and crying for their teammate. As Dell was lifted onto the ambulance, his teammates surrounded him, hugging each other. They were emotional about the scene in front of them.

                "content": "Nathaniel Jasper \"Tank\" Dell Jr. (born October 29, 1999) is an American professional football wide receiver for the Houston Texans of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Alabama A&M, Independence Community College, and Houston. Dell attended Mainland High School in Daytona Beach, Florida.[1] He had originally committed to Florida International University (FIU) to play college football but attended Alabama A&M University instead.[2][3] After one year at Alabama A&M in which he had 12 receptions for 364 yards and three touchdowns, he transferred to Independence Community College.[4] In his lone year at Independence, he had 52 receptions for 766 yards and eight touchdowns.[5][1] Dell transferred to the University of Houston in 2020.[6] In his first year at Houston, he led the team with 29 receptions for 428 yards and three touchdowns over eight games.[7] In 2021, he again led the team with 90 receptions for 1,329 yards with 12 touchdowns.[8][9] He returned to Houston as the number one receiver in 2022, during which he made 100 receptions for 1,398 receiving yards and 17 receiving touchdowns in only 13 games played. Dell was drafted by the Houston Texans in the third round, 69th overall, of the 2023 NFL draft.[12] In Week 11 against the Arizona Cardinals, Dell caught a career-high eight passes for a career-high 149 yards, and one touchdown.[13] In Week 13 against the Denver Broncos, Dell suffered a fractured fibula and was ruled out for the rest of the season. He went under surgery to repair the fibula the next day.[14][15] He finished the season with 47 catches for 709 yards and seven touchdowns, which was among the rookie leaders at the time of the injury.[16] In Week 9 of the 2024 season, against the New York Jets, Dell had six receptions for 126 yards in the 21–13 loss.[17] In Week 15 of the 2024 season against the Kansas City Chiefs, Tank suffered a season ending knee injury after catching a touchdown pass from C.J. Stroud after being fallen on by Jared Wayne. On April 27, 2024, Dell sustained minor injuries from a shooting in Sanford, Florida. He was released from the hospital the next day.[18]",

                "content": "Houston Texans wide receiver Tank Dell suffered a serious-looking leg injury after scoring a touchdown in the team's Week 16 game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Naturally, Dell's teammates were distraught after watching the second-year wideout go down. C.J. Stroud was among those who were upset as Dell was receiving medical attention in the back of the end zone. The NBC broadcast showed the second-year quarterback being comforted by veteran running back Joe Mixon while trying to fight off tears. CHIEFS VS. TEXANS:Highlights, score update from Week 16 Saturday game Stroud and Dell have a close relationship, with the quarterback referring to Dell as his \"best friend on the team\" in an appearance on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" during the 2023 season. The duo entered the league together as high-drafted rookies and worked out before the 2023 NFL draft, and their bond continued to grow in Houston. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. It's easy to see why Stroud was so upset on the play. The same can be said of Jared Wayne, who also showed emotion after the injury. Wayne, a second-year receiver, was playing in just his second career NFL game when he collided with Dell while also trying to make a play on Stroud's pass to the end zone. He was shown being comforted by his teammates while on a knee, his face tinged red. Many other members of the Texans gathered around Dell as he was tended to as a show of support. Will Anderson appeared to lead his teammates in a prayer before Dell was carted off the field. Nico Collins spoke to reporters about Dell's injury in the Texans' locker room. Collins said \"it just hurt\" to see Dell get injured and credited his teammate for the positive attitude he brings to the field. \"He's one of my brothers man,\" Collins said of Dell. \"He brings that energy, brings that juice. [He] brings that energy we all need when we're down. He's that guy that can make you smile when everything's not going as good.\" Collins also expressed that he hopes Dell is doing OK. He also lamented that Dell suffered a significant injury and said he would give his teammate the space needed to cope with the reality of his situation. \"You know how much this game means to him, to us? And just [to see him] go down like that? It's frustrating,\" Collins said. Meanwhile, Stroud was asked about Dell on the podium and briefly struggled to find words to describe how he felt. \"It's not easy just to let it go, especially since that's my best friend,\" Stroud said of Dell's injury. \"It's not easy to move on and just keep playing, but I tried to do as best as I could.\" Stroud also credited his teammates for helping him through the difficult transition of worrying about Dell's health to resuming the game. \"My teammates held me up,\" Stroud said. \"Joe [Mixon] held me up, so I appreciate those guys just talking to me because I was going through it. So, I appreciate them just being there for me.\" Dell's teammates weren't the only ones showing love to the injured receiver. Dell received plenty of well wishes from the NFL world on social media as well.

                "title": "Oleksandr Usyk vs. Tyson Fury 2 results, highlights: Ukrainian champ retains titles in high-paced duel - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Tyson Fury spent a decade and a half and 35 professional fights without suffering defeat, he has now lost back-to-back fights to Oleksandr Usyk. The native of Ukraine won their fantastic, high-pace second fight by unanimous decision on Saturday in Saudi Arabia to remain WBO, WBA and WBC world champion.. Momentum swung wildly for the first half of the bout, with Fury landing hard jabs and occasional right hands while Usyk focused his attack on Fury's body. Despite Fury weighing in at more than 280 pounds for the fight, the constant Usyk body attack never fully slowed Fury down. What did turn the tables was Usyk's left hand from his southpaw stance. That shot landed with increased frequency as the fight wore on and led to Fury backing into the ropes more often in the second half of the fight. This was similar to their first meeting in May, when Fury fought brilliantly early before Usyk took the fight over, including scoring a knockdown in Round 9 of that bout. Fury didn't suffer a knockdown in the rematch, but did struggle to keep up with Usyk's pace and pressure. Usyk was also brilliantly sharp with his punch selection, landing 179 of 423 punches to 144 of 509 for Fury. At the conclusion of 12 rounds, the ringside judges turned in identical scores of 116-112, though they did not have consensus on which rounds each man won, something Fury promoter Frank Warren took issue with while claiming his fighter deserved the nod. Both fights between Usyk and Fury are in the Fight of the Year discussion for 2024 and the Fury that showed up on Saturday night would likely defeat every heavyweight on the planet not named Oleksandr Usyk. \"He's a great fighter and a great opponent,\" Usyk said after the fight. \"It's a great fight for 24 rounds, unbelievable 24 rounds in my career.\" Asked about what's next in his career, Usyk delivered a line in broken English in his classic deadpan style. \"I can more,\" Usyk said. Usyk's post-fight interview was interrupted by IBF champion Daniel Dubois. Usyk defeated Dubois by knockout in 2023 and it was Dubois who picked up the IBF title after Usyk was stripped by the sanctioning body for going ahead with his contractually obligated rematch with Fury. \"I want my revenge,\" Dubois said as he grabbed the microphone. \"I want my revenge, Usyk. Well done tonight. I want my revenge.\" Usyk said he was willing to go through with the rematch, telling Turki Alalshikh to make the fight. Should that fight materialize -- Dubois is scheduled to defend his title against Joseph Parker on Feb. 22 -- Usyk would have a chance to become a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion. He moved to the heavyweight division in 2019 after a cruiserweight career that saw him go undisputed at that weight. CBS Sports was with you throughout the entire way on Saturday with live updates, scores and analysis. Thanks for stopping by. Official result: Oleksandr Usyk def.

All three judges scored the fight 116-112. WATCH: Oleksandr Usyk vs. Tyson Fury 2 on DAZN There were no knockdowns in the fight and neither man was seriously hurt in what evolved into a super-skilled chess match. \"I win. Thank you, God,\" said Usyk during his post-fight interview with DAZN. \"[Tyson Fury] is a great fighter, a great opponent. It’s been an unbelievable 24 rounds for my career. “I dedicate this fight to my mother.” REPEAT 😤Oleksandr Usyk reigns supreme once again! 🇺🇦#Usyk2Fury | #RiyadhSeason | @Turki_alalshikh pic.twitter.com/qevlyDjP8f The early rounds were very close with Fury notably more aggressive than he was early in the first fight. Usyk adapted well, though, and targetted the Englishman's ample mid-section with a sharp straight left hand. Fury's trademark jab was finding its mark and the early rounds were difficult to score. The fourth round was the entire fight in microcosm with Usyk punishing his man with two left hands, only to be pounded backwards by the challenger. A big left uppercut in round five was Fury's best punch of the fight to that point. However, Usyk sucked it up and took the next three rounds on SN's scorecard. He boxed brilliantly at times and Fury's work rate dropped. Calling on every ounce of his championship reserves, Fury performed very well in the ninth and tenth rounds. He scored with a terrific right uppercut and the one-two combinations were heavy. He just could not hurt Usyk. The former champ needed a grandstand finish, but Uysk closed very well. Fury left the ring without doing an interview, while Daniel Dubois crashed Usyk's interview to call out the man who defeated him by TKO last year. The IBF champ must get past Joseph Parker in February -- no sure thing -- to make that rematch a reality.

Bohachuk going through the gears and it looks like a matter of time. 4:09 p.m. ET | 1:09 p.m. PT | 9:09 p.m. GMT: DOWN GOES DAVIS from a ridiculously short left hook on the inside in round two. That was a major reality check for the British fighter. Bohachuk is now in hot pursuit. 4:04 p.m. ET | 1:04 p.m. PT | 9:04 p.m. GMT: SWITCH HITTER DAVIS STUNS BOHACHUK WITH A RIGHT HOOK COUNTER OVER THE JAB IN ROUND ONE. The underdog likely takes the round due to that one moment and is off to a good start. 3:59 p.m. ET | 12:59 p.m. PT | 8:59 p.m. GMT: Two more fights before the main event. Next up we have Serhii Bohachuk, who gave the unbeaten Vergil Ortiz Jr. hell on earth in a Fight of the Year contender earlier, against late replacement Ishmael Davis from the U.K. Bohachuk was due to face former WBA super welterweight champ Israil Madrimov, who pulled out due to bronchitis. 3:45 p.m. ET | 12:45 p.m. PT | 8:45 p.m. GMT: Scrappy action in the final round but a great fight overall. Allen should get the decision but we've seen stranger things. 3:38 p.m. ET | 12:38 p.m. PT | 8:38 p.m. GMT: Incredibly we're in round nine and Allen is in command. Regardless, the feeling is that he should have had Fisher out of here by now. We're close to going to points and he'll never forgive himself if this goes against him. 3:31 p.m. ET | 12:31 p.m. PT | 8:31 p.m. GMT: Allen working now and he's landed the better blows in rounds six and seven. Fisher loses his shape often and absorbs some hellacious shots. This is ALL OUT WAR!!! Can it really go 10 rounds? 3:18 p.m. ET | 12:18 p.m. PT | 8:18 p.m. GMT: DOWN GOES JOHNNY FISHER FROM A HUGE LEFT ON THE INSIDE IN ROUND FIVE. He's up but out on his feet!!! More HUGE shots from Allen. Fisher gets the odd one back, but he's pouring blood from a broken nose. Both fighters touch gloves after an EPIC round. 3:18 p.m. ET | 12:18 p.m. PT | 8:18 p.m. GMT: Not much has changed through three rounds. Fisher is scoring all the damaging punches while Allen marches forward and does all the catching. Now and again Allen releases a big bomb, but all he's doing at the moment is making Fisher work. 3:09 p.m. ET | 12:09 p.m. PT | 8:09 p.m. GMT: The opening round was very one-sided with Fisher scoring all the effective punches, particularly to the body. Allen released very few shots and will need to get into this one quickly, or he risks being completely overwhelmed. 3:03 p.m. ET | 12:03 p.m. PT | 8:03 p.m. GMT: This next one should be a lot of fun. In an all-British heavyweight shootout, the unbeaten Johnny Fisher takes on Dave Allen, who is humorously nicknamed \"The Doncaster De La Hoya\". Both men are friends but all respect goes out the window tonight. 2:50 p.m. ET | 11:50 a.m. PT | 7:50 p.m. GMT: GUM SHIELD OUT AGAIN AND LOWE LOSES A POINT. Frustrating for him because he's trying hard to get the knockout he needs in round ten. Brutal inside exchanges for the remainder of the fight. Two huge uppercuts land from McGregor in the final 30 seconds. This should be a big win for the Scotsman. 2:45 p.m. ET | 11:45 a.m. PT | 7:45 p.m. GMT: McGREGOR LOOKS HURT IN ROUND 9, perhaps succumbing to a body attack. Lowe goes all out for the finish, but his gumshield comes out on two occasions in his biggest round of the fight, spoiling his momentum. The corner tells Lowe he needs a stoppage in the 10th and final round. 2:38 p.m. ET | 11:38 a.m. PT | 7:38 p.m. GMT: The final minute of round seven was the best of the fight for McGregor, who landed flush single shots from the outside. Lowe catching everything and having no success. He needs a big moment. 2:35 p.m. ET | 11:35 a.m. PT | 7:35 p.m. GMT: We're through six rounds and it's a brutal affair. McGregor has significant swelling under both eyes, while Lowe has cuts above both of his and is oozing blood. McGregor, the Scotsman, looks to be ahead on the scoring due to superior accuracy and sharpness. 2:20 p.m. ET | 11:20 a.m. PT | 7:20 p.m. GMT: We're three rounds into this 10-rounder and it's been very entertaining. Lowe is the bigger and stronger man in the ring, but McGregor is scoring the more eye-catching punches. Perfectly poised. 2:12 p.m. ET | 11:12 a.m. PT | 7:12 p.m. GMT: Excellent first round. Both men stun each other with flush left hooks. In a grudge fight, these two are being very aggressive and leaving a lot of gaps. 2:04 p.m. ET | 11:04 a.m. PT | 7:04 p.m. GMT: An intriguing Scotland vs. England clash next as Lee McGregor takes on Isaac Lowe at featherweight. This fight is scheduled for 10 rounds. 1:55 p.m. ET | 10:55 a.m. PT | 6:55 p.m. GMT: It's been the fight of the night so far and both men believe they've won at the end of 10 rounds. We go to the scorecards. 1:44 p.m. ET | 10:44 a.m. PT | 6:44 p.m. GMT: Edwards is now putting forth a sustained body attack and it appears to be troubling McGrail in round eight. It's been a high-contact and evenly contested fight and the last two rounds could be crucial in the scoring. 1:37 p.m. ET | 10:37 a.m. PT | 6:37 p.m. GMT: McGrail, with the blood running down his right cheek, appears to have the slightest of advantages but nothing resembling a breakthrough. Given that he took this fight on five days' notice, Edwards is performing brilliantly through six rounds. 1:25 p.m. ET | 10:25 a.m. PT | 6:25 p.m. GMT: Terrific and evenly contested action so far. Lefty McGrail sustains a cut above his right eye from a clash of heads, which is a common occurrence when a southpaw faces an orthodox opponent (power hands on the same side). 1:10 p.m. ET | 10:10 a.m. PT | 6:10 p.m. GMT: Next up is Peter McGrail against Rhys Edwards at super featherweight. Edwards steps in at very late notice to replace Dennis McCann, who was removed from the card after failing a drug test. The bout is scheduled for 10 rounds. 1:03 p.m. ET | 10:03 a.m. PT | 6:03 p.m. GMT: This 10-round light heavyweight fight is over. If the judges have found a way to give Colin a round, then it'll be a big surprise. 12:42 p.m. ET | 9:42 a.m. PT | 5:42 p.m. GMT: Lapin stuns his man with a sharp right hook count punch in round eight. It was an excellent shot, but the Ukrainian didn't follow up effectively with a second phase of attack. Regardless, he's in cruise control and winning this fight by a mile. 12:42 p.m. ET | 9:42 a.m. PT | 5:42 p.m. GMT: Colin is trying to get inside on his longer opponent but he just can't do it. Lapin effectively controls distance and scores well with the lead hand. It's likely a shutout after five rounds. 12:28 p.m. ET | 9:28 a.m. PT | 5:28 p.m. GMT: Southpaw Lapin has a five-inch height advantage and he's using it already. A nice left hand rocked Colin in the opening round. The Frenchman has his work cut out for him here. 12:20 p.m. ET | 9:20 a.m. PT | 5:20 p.m. GMT: The next fight of the night is an intriguing light heavyweight collision between Ukrainian star Daniel Lapin and Frenchman Dylan Colin. Both fighters are unbeaten. 12:10 p.m. ET | 9:10 a.m. PT | 5:10 p.m. GMT: Novytskyi closed well in a drab and listless fight. He should win decisively enough on points and extend his unbeaten record. 12:01 p.m. ET | 9:01 a.m. PT | 5:01 p.m. GMT: Ramirez came through with his best round in the eighth, scoring well to the body and the head. Novytskyi has been disappointing here, even if he is ahead in the fight. 11:55 a.m. ET | 8:55 a.m. PT | 4:55 p.m. GMT: Six rounds gone and the action is pedestrian. Novytskyi is in control but he lacks ambition. Ramirez is just following his man around and occasionally lands the odd eye-catching single shot. He needs to go a lot more to turn this around. 11:40 a.m. ET | 8:40 a.m. PT | 4:40 p.m. GMT: We're three rounds in and Novytskyi is in command. He's producing the cleaner work and Ramirez is doing very little to discourage him. 11:20 a.m. ET | 8:20 a.m. PT | 4:20 p.m. GMT: Next up is a heavyweight attraction between Ukraine's Andrii Novytskyi and Edgar Ramirez. The bout is scheduled for 10 rounds. 11:15 a.m. ET | 8:15 a.m. PT | 4:15 p.m. GMT: The fight is over and we've gone the six-round distance. Alakel turned in a tidy, disciplined and impressive showing. He's undoubtedly won every round. 11:05 a.m. ET | 8:05 a.m. PT | 4:05 p.m. GMT: We're three rounds down and Alakel is having a field day. Looking even more impressive than he did in his debut, the Saudi Arabian prospect has won every round and scored a right-hand knockdown in the second. 10:50 a.m. ET | 7:50 a.m. PT | 3:30 p.m. GMT: The first fight is about to get underway in Riyadh. It's a super bantamweight bout between Joe Gallagher-trained Mohammed Alakel and journeyman Joshua Ocampo. 10:30 a.m. ET | 7:30 a.m. PT | 3:30 p.m. GMT: It should also be remembered that Usyk is not only the best heavyweight in the world, but he's also the finest pound-for-pound fighter in the world today. The Ukrainian hero holds the No. 1 position with both The Sporting News and The Ring. 10 a.m. ET | 7 a.m. PT | 3 p.m. GMT: If Usyk were to repeat his epic triumph over Fury, then he'd confirm his status as the finest heavyweight of this generation. That would be two wins over Fury, two wins over Anthony Joshua, and a stoppage win over the reigning IBF titleholder Daniel Dubois. 9:45 a.m. ET | 6:45 a.m. PT | 2:45 p.m. GMT: If Fury avenges his lone professional defeat to Usyk, then he would join Muhammad Ali, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis and Michael Moorer as boxing's only three-time heavyweight champions. Note: Holyfield holds the record as the sport's only four-time heavyweight king. 9:30 a.m. ET | 6:30 a.m. PT | 2:30 p.m. GMT: Just an update on the official weights for tonight's main event. Tyson Fury weighed in at a career-heavy 281 pounds, which is 19 pounds up on his number for the first fight. Usyk also came in the heaviest of his career at 226 pounds, which is two-and-a-half pounds up from fight one.It must be said that both fighters were fully clothed on the scales. It's guesswork, but Fury, who was wearing several layers, is probably around the 275 mark, whereas Usyk will be on or around his habitual 221. 9:15 a.m. ET | 6:15 a.m. PT | 2:15 p.m. GMT: We're in the countdown to the undercard getting underway at the Kingdom Arena. Eight bouts from a variety of different weight classes will precede the historic rematch between unified champ Oleksandr Usyk and former king Tyson Fury. 9 a.m. ET | 6 a.m. PT | 2 p.m. GMT: Hello and welcome to The Sporting News' live coverage of the rematch between unified heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk and the former king Tyson Fury.

                "content": "First Team Club Tickets & Museum Download the official FC Barcelona App FC Barcelona have suffered a third consecutive home defeat in Liga. And this was perhaps the cruellest of all. In one of those games that are impossible to fathom, they played delightful football from start to finish, while Atlético were just a shadow of the side they had been bigged up to be in the build-up to Saturday’s fixture. Barça fans will be going home tonight wondering how on earth it happened, but they lost. When Pedri had given the Catalans the lead after half an hour, it was a fair reflection of the utter blaugrana domination we had enjoyed. On the back of footballing brilliance, there were plenty more chances where that came from, but the visitors managed to scramble an equaliser in practically their only attack of the entire 90 minutes of regular time play. Unfazed, Barça kept pressing but the winner just didn’t want to come and in the final minute of injury time, Atlético stunned the Estadi Olimpic with a late winner. It was the first time since 2006 that Barça have lost at home to Atlético, and the result means that today’s winners go three points clear at the top of the table, and with a game in hand. If Real Madrid win on Sunday, Barça would drop down to third after collecting just five of the last 21 points on offer. It’s not a great situation to be in, made all the more frustrating by the fact that today’s defeat was so utterly unwarranted. Barça had underperformed in their last two home fixtures, but there were no signs of recent shortcomings when this game got under way. All the energy and ideas that were lacking against Las Palmas and Leganés were back on display, and pretty much the entire first half was constant blaugrana pressure. Raphinha came especially close to scoring before and an extremely busy Jan Oblak was finally beaten just before the half hour. He was having a class game, but Gavi failed to fully control Pedri’s pass. Luckily for him, he inadvertently positioned the ball perfectly for the Canary Islander to finish off the move and put Barça ahead. Nobody could argue that the lead was anything less than Barça deserved. They were well and truly bossing this in every department. Unable to keep the ball long enough to create any danger of their own, Atlético were utterly overwhelmed at the back, making numerous unforced errors, and being made to look nothing like a side that had come into this game on a run of 11 straight victories. But football can be a very cruel sport. Moments after Raphinha had lobbed the most exquisite of long balls from Pedri onto the bar, Atlético somehow managed to equalise. A rare mistake from Marc Casadó and Rodrigo De Paul found himself in a position to shoot. With practically their first meaningful attack of the game, the visitors were back level. A goal like that often changes the dynamic of a game. Not this time. It was still all Barça, and the Estadi Olimpic was possibly the loudest its ever been as the fans willed the team to get the second goal and do justice to what they were witnessing. Robert Lewandowski had it. But he fumbled a wonderful opportunity and in the move that immediately followed had it not been for a superlative Iñaki Peña, Pablo Barrios could have earned Atlético a mystifying lead. The pace of this game had been relentless all the way, and the final minutes were more intense still. Barça piled forward, but time and again they came up against an inspired Oblak in the visiting goal. Atlético looked exhausted, but their Slovenian keeper was keeping them in the game. It was agonising to watch. Barça so, so deserved to be winning this. They certainly didn’t deserve to lose it. But in the dying minutes of injury time, as they were desperately giving it one last go, Barça were caught on the break. Alexander Sørloth was there to convert. Atlético had no idea had they had won this. And Barça had no idea how they had lost. Heartbreaking.",

                "content": "DOWNLOAD OUR APPS Atlético Madrid defeated FC Barcelona 2-1 in the 18th round of La Liga, with goals from Rodrigo De Paul and Alexander Sorloth for Atlético. Pedri scored for Barcelona. In an emotional clash, Atlético de Madrid stunned FC Barcelona with a last-minute comeback (1-2) in Matchday 18 of LaLiga. The winning goal came in the 96th minute from Alexander Sorloth, who capitalized on a counterattack to give the Colchoneros their twelfth consecutive win, while also snatching the top spot in the league from Barça, who now sit in second place. Barcelona's Dominance and Football’s Justice From the start, FC Barcelona dominated the game, with Pedri pulling the strings in midfield and a fluid style of play creating several clear chances. The pressure from Raphinha and his crosses for Lewandowski continuously troubled the Atlético defense, who struggled to maintain possession. In the 30th minute, Barcelona's dominance paid off when Pedri combined with Gavi and scored the opening goal with a precise cross-shot. Despite Barcelona’s control, Atlético stayed afloat thanks to Jan Oblak's key interventions and Barcelona’s inability to capitalize on important moments. The team led by Xabi Flick failed to make the most of their superiority, missing clear chances such as Raphinha's crossbar or Fermín’s missed one-on-one opportunity. Atlético's Comeback The second half began with more opportunities for Barça, but it was Atlético who took their first clear chance in the 61st minute. A pass from Julián Álvarez to Rodrigo De Paul, who curled in a stunning goal from outside the box, equalized the score. Although Barcelona tried to regain control with the introduction of Dani Olmo, their chances continued to be squandered. In the final minutes, Oblak kept his team alive with key saves against Olmo, Raphinha, and Pedri. However, football had one last surprise in store: in the 96th minute, Raphinha lost possession of the ball, and Atlético launched a deadly counterattack, which Sorloth finished off to score the winner, sending the Atlético bench into a frenzy. A Bitter End for Barcelona Atlético de Madrid took the three points and now leads LaLiga with 41 points, while FC Barcelona drops to second place with 38 points. The Blaugrana end the year on a sour note, having earned only five points from their last seven matches after having a substantial lead at the top of the table. With this result, Atlético Madrid climbs to the top of La Liga, taking the first spot from Barcelona with 41 points, while Barcelona drops to second with 38 points. DOWNLOAD OUR APPS",

                "content": "Justin Louis Baldoni (born January 24, 1984)[1] is an American actor and filmmaker. He is best known for portraying Rafael Solano on the CW satirical telenovela Jane the Virgin (2014–2019) as well as directing the romance drama films Five Feet Apart (2019), Clouds (2020) and It Ends with Us (2024).[2] Baldoni was born in Los Angeles, California, and was raised in Medford, Oregon, the son of Sharon and Sam Baldoni.[3] His mother is from a Jewish family,[4] and his father is of Italian ancestry. His paternal grandfather is Louis Baldoni, an Indiana senator and Italian immigrant.[5] Baldoni's parents joined the Baháʼí Faith, which Baldoni practices devoutly.[6][7] Baldoni played soccer and ran track in high school, and was a radio disc jockey at a local top-40 radio station. While moving into a new apartment building, Baldoni met a manager who advised him to pursue a career in acting.[8] He attended college on a partial athletic scholarship, but later dropped out.[9] Baldoni made his acting debut in the soap opera The Young and the Restless in 2004. In 2008, Baldoni wrote, produced, and directed his first music video that was selected and won him his first \"Audience Choice Award\" at Dawn Breakers International Film Festival.[10] In 2012, Baldoni created a digital documentary series, My Last Days, a show about living—as told by the dying.[11][12] The show eventually became one of the most-watched YouTube documentary series streamed online.[13] The second season of My Last Days aired on CW and third season was released in the winter of 2018.

It was released on October 16, 2020.[23] In 2024 Baldoni directed, produced, and starred in the romantic drama It Ends with Us, based on Colleen Hoover's novel of the same name.[24] In the film, in which he acted opposite Blake Lively, Baldoni portrays a neurosurgeon who is a domestic abuser. The film bacame a box office hit, earning over $350 million, but it received mixed reviews from critics.[25][26] Baldoni and Lively had a combative working relationship on the set, with Lively accusing him of sexually harassing her and creating a toxic workplace environment. When The New York Times investigated the incident, it revealed private messages from Baldoni that suggested a smear campaign against her. Baldoni hired a PR crisis firm in order to \"bury her\" through social media platforms such as Tiktok, reddit, and X after Lively accused him of misconduct.[27] In July 2017, Variety announced that Baldoni was developing a male talk show through his media company Wayfarer Entertainment. The show, entitled Man Enough, is described as a disruptive panel series that explores what it means to be a man today.[28] In an interview, Baldoni described the reason he created the show. \"Man Enough really came about because I wanted to take a dive into what it really means to be a man, and this question of 'do we have it right?'\"[29] The show includes men like Matt McGorry and Javier Muñoz.[30] In August 2017, TED announced Baldoni would be a speaker at the annual TEDWomen Conference.[31] In 2021, Baldoni released a book under the same premise as his previous talk show and TED Talk titled Man Enough: Undefining My Masculinity.[32] He began a podcast series under the same name with co-hosts Liz Plank and Jamey Heath. A children's version of the book Boys Will Be Human was released in October 2022.[33] Baldoni founded a production company with Ahmed Musiol called Wayfarer Studios that produces television, films, and digital content.

According to the suit, Lively claimed she was in a hostile work environment. Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, had sit-down meetings with Wayfarer Studios to address their demands of Baldoni, which were reported to include \"not showing nude videos or images of women to Lively; no more mentions of Baldoni's alleged previous 'pornography addiction'; no more discussions about sexual experiences in front of Lively and others; no further mentions of cast and crew's genitalia; and no more inquiries about Lively's weight.\"[43][44] Baldoni has denied the accusations.[45] In response to the allegations the talent agency WME dropped Baldoni as a client.[46]",

An actor and director, Baldoni played Raphael in the rom-com Jane the Virgin for five years, before directing and starring in It Ends With Us - the film adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s hit novel. And don’t worry - we talk ALLLL about it. He’s also a speaker, producer and entrepreneur. His book and eponymous podcast ‘Man Enough’ both seek to reframe modern masculinity, and were inspired by his hugely successful TED talk on the necessity of deconstructing traditional stereotypes about masculinity. In doing so, he seeks to fight the oppression of all genders. Well, I think we can all say hurrah to that.

Jhon Duran and Morgan Rogers struck in each half for the home side at a lively Villa Park, with Phil Foden's strike in second-half added time proving scant consolation for City and their commendable away support. Pep Guardiola's side, beaten by Manchester United in last weekend's derby by the same scoreline, are now on a run of nine defeats in 12 games in all competitions and are without an away victory since October 20. They could find themselves 12 points adrift of league leaders Liverpool by Christmas depending on results later this weekend. Full commentary and highlights | Team news and lineups Venue: Villa Park, BirminghamReferee: Peter Bankes Keep track of every game and every goal via SN's live Premier League scoreboard Starting lineups: Aston Villa (4-3-3, right to left): 23. Emiliano Martinez (GK) — 2. Matty Cash, 4. Ezri Konsa, 14. Pau Torres, 12. Lucas Digne — 8. Youri Tielemans, 44. Boubacar Kamara, 24. Amadou Onana — 7. John McGinn, 9. Jhon Duran (11. Ollie Watkins), 27. Morgan Rogers (10. Emi Buendia) Man City (4-2-3-1, right to left): 18. Stefan Ortega (GK) — 82. Rico Lewis, 5. John Stones (2. Kyle Walker), 25. Manuel Akanji, 24. Josko Gvardiol — 19. Ilkay Gundogan (26. Savinho), 8. Mateo Kovacic (11. Jeremy Doku) — 20. Bernardo Silva, 47. Phil Foden, 10. Jack Grealish — 9. Erling Haaland MORE: All the latest Man City news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings Villa had three golden chances to score inside the opening three minutes, Duran forcing a save from Stefan Ortega — in for the absent Ederson — before the City keeper produced a remarkable reflex save to stop the ball being glanced in from the resulting corner. Amadou Onana then headed over the bar from close range. Duran made the most of his next opportunity, though, side-footing past Ortega after being set up by Rogers following a quite wonderful through ball from the outstanding Youri Tielemans. City dominated possession in the first half but found little joy against Villa's organised defence, with a misdirected Josko Gvardiol header from Jack Grealish's cross the closest they game to an equaliser. Villa took a more front-foot approach after halftime and should have doubled their lead before the hour. Matty Cash fired into the side netting instead of crossing for Boubacar Kamara for a tap-in, and Rogers drilled a shot off the outside of the left-hand post. Rogers made no mistake with his next chance. Having started the move with a strong midfield run that left Mateo Kovacic for dead, he received a pass from John McGinn and fired a left-foot strike into the bottom-right corner, with Ortega motionless in his goal. City heads seemed to drop and Villa looked the more likely to get the game's third goal, with substitute Ollie Watkins shooting straight at Ortega with a presentable opportunity. At the other end, Erling Haaland threw himself despairingly at a looping cross, having spent the whole game on the fringes. Foden ended his long wait for a Premier League goal when he slotted past Emiliano Martinez after Lucas Digne had slipped on the loose ball in the Villa box, but by that stage, a comeback felt implausible. City are now on a worse run of form than Erik ten Hag's Manchester United were before the Dutchman was sacked in late October. Guardiola will almost certainly not face the same fate, but quite how he turns things around this season is hard to fathom. That's that! City don't have time for a comeback. It's yet another defeat for Guardiola's team. 90+2 mins: GOAL! FODEN GETS ONE BACK! Savinho runs well with the ball and finds his teammate, who has a shot blocked but gets the ball back thanks to Lucas Digne's slip. Foden then has a simple finish into the bottom-right corner. Can they rescue a result?

The champions are running out of time here. 82 mins: Rogers races away from Walker and plays a reverse pass to substitute Ollie Watkins, who shots straight at Ortega on his weaker foot. Guardiola throws his hands up and turns away in disgust. 79 mins: Villa are on the hunt for a third goal. City are very passive without the ball right now. It's not a good watch for any fans. 72 mins: Savinho is on for Ilkay Gundogan as Guardiola rolls the dice to try to get back into this game. 65 mins: GOAL! NO MISTAKE FROM ROGERS THIS TIME! The outstanding Tielemans combines well with McGinn, who sets up Rogers to drill a low shot past the motionless Ortega. Villa are in complete control now!

Gvardiol isn't strong enough with a challenge in his own box and the ball falls kindly the Rogers, whose low shot crashes off the outside of the left-hand post. He should really have hit the target. 57 mins: Akanji is going to continue, although he doesn't look entirely comfortable. 56 mins: Akanji makes a good sliding challenge on Duran, and both men stay down. Akanji looks to have landed awkwardly on his shoulder. This is the last thing City need right now. Duran is back up and looks okay. 53 mins: Onana, who has looked a bit of a passenger in the Villa midfield at times today, accidentally stands on the back of Foden's ankle. That looked a painful one for the City man, although he's back up on his feet. 51 mins: Duran smashes a finish past Ortega after being played through by Tielemans, but the flag goes up, and the striker seemed to be expecting it. He was indeed offside, although not by a lot. 49 mins: BIG CHANCE WASTED BY CASH! More brilliant Tielemans work in midfield sets up another swift attack. McGinn plays it to the overlapping Cash, who blasts the ball into the side-netting of Ortega's goal when Kamara was waiting in the middle for a tap-in! 47 mins: Rico Lewis is booked for stopping Tielemans on the counter. The City man has moved to left-back, with Walker on the right of the defence and Gvardiol partnering Akanji in the centre. City have made a change at the break: Kyle Walker is on for John Stones. The half ends as Grealish is halted by Cash again, and the City man then gets into a heated argument with Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, who has gone into the book. 43 mins: BIG CHANCE FOR GVARDIOL! The defender leads a City break, finds Grealish and continues his run into the box. Grealish's cross lands right on the full-back's head, but he's stretching for the ball and can't keep his attempt on target. 41 mins: The game has entered a bit of a lull. City are still struggling to pick their way through Villa, and the hosts have had a couple of chances to break quickly without making the most of them. 35 mins: City offer a glimpse of what they can do at their best, with Foden and Lewis combining well with some slick passes, but Martinez is equal to the former's shot. Duran clears the first corner, and the second is rather wasted. 27 mins: Gvardiol plays a teasing cross towards Haaland, but Pau Torres is able to clear. City are focusing all their attacks down the left at the moment. 23 mins: We're back into City possession and deep Villa defending, but so far, the home side are quite comfortable. City haven't got the ball to Haaland in any dangerous positions yet. 16 mins: GOAL! DURAN PUTS VILLA AHEAD! The No. 9 has a simple side-footed finish from the middle of the box after Morgan Rogers had squared it. But that all came from a simply wonderful throughball from Youri Tielemans, who came to receive a pass from his goalkeeper, turned away from pressure, and threaded the ball quite magnificently through City's defence and into Rogers' path.

The visitors have settled now, but the hosts are defending their box well. 9 mins: Grealish has had a lively start against his old club. Villa fans cheer as he is felled by Matty Cash, but this is a free-kick in a decent position for City. Villa just about clear their lines in the end. 3 mins: Amadou Onana has a near free header and sends it over the bar. That's another chance gone for Villa, and we've only had three minutes! 2 mins: HOW HAS THAT STAYED OUT? The corner is glanced on and Ortega gets fingertips to the ball to claw it away at the near post, and Erling Haaland clears. The referee signals that the ball did not cross the line — but boy, that was close. That's how close Aston Villa came to opening the scoring inside 2 minutes against Man City 👀📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/jGQVWA9L93 1 min: VILLA SHOULD BE AHEAD! Josko Gvardiol is caught on the ball by John McGinn, and Jhon Duran has a clear run at goal. He tries a low shot from 25 yards out, and Stefan Ortega makes a good save to tip it behind. The Villa striker could have taken the ball closer to goal, there. Here we go! 5 mins before kickoff: Villa Park's traditional pyrotechnics are ongoing as the teams begin to make their way onto the pitch. 35 mins before kickoff: Guardiola told TNT Sports in the UK that Ederson \"is not here, he doesn't feel good\". He was happy to welcome back Stones and Akanji, though, despite a relative lack of preparation. \"They trained two or three times,\" he said. \"Of course, they are important players.\" Arrived at Villa Park! 👊#ManCity | #AsahiSuperDry pic.twitter.com/CMFNIXNKLr 1 hour before kickoff: Interesting team news for today: Jack Grealish starts against his old club, with Kevin De Bruyne on the bench. City are also able to welcome back Manuel Akanji to the defence, which actually looks solid on paper this time, although Ederson is not in the squad at all. Villa look to be going 4-3-3, with Amadou Onana starting in an imposing-looking midfield. Jhon Duran leads the attack. 1 hour 30 mins before kickoff: Guardiola is hoping for at least one return from injury today in the form of Manuel Akanji, but the news of Ruben Dias’ weeks-long layoff was another blow in what is proving a hugely difficult season for the reigning champions. 2 hours before kickoff: City and Villa get us underway for this latest Premier League weekend — the first of the busy holiday season. Pep Guardiola may be used to the packed December schedule by now, but he is certainly not accustomed to reaching this point of the season with his team in such disarray: they have lost five of their most recent seven Premier League games, as many as they had in their previous 67 matches combined. Manchester City were leading 1-0 at 87:10, but less than two minutes later (89:06) Manchester United lead 2-1 in the derby.Astonishing. pic.twitter.com/hTIBQ0b1Dx This Premier League match kicks off in Birmingham, UK at 12:30 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: Villa look to be going with a 4-3-3 set-up, with Amadou Onana coming into midfield to partner Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans. Matty Cash reverts to right-back, the Poland international having played on the wing during the defeat to Forest. Emery does not expect Jacob Ramsey to be back from a muscle issue until early January, but Leon Bailey is back on the bench after recovering from a \"small\" thigh injury. Tyrone Mings has sat out Villa's past three games in all competitions but is fit enough to make the matchday squad, having overcome an illness. Aston Villa starting lineup (4-3-3, right to left): Martinez (GK) — Cash, Konsa, Torres, Digne — Tielemans, Kamara, Onana — McGinn, Duran, Rogers Aston Villa subs: Mings, Barkley, Buendia, Watkins, Nedeljkovic, Maatsen, Olsen, Bogarde, Bailey MORE: All the latest EPL club news | Team-by-team Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings News that Ruben Dias is facing four weeks on the sidelines represents another body blow to Guardiola, although Manuel Akanji and John Stones returning to the lineup means City's defence looks much more robust than it has recently. Rico Lewis is available after a one-match suspension and comes straight back into the lineup in place of the under-fire Kyle Walker at right-back. Jack Grealish starts against his former club, with Phil Foden the No. 10 in place of the benched Kevin De Bruyne. Goalkeeper Ederson \"does not feel good\", according to Guardiola, and is not in the matchdays squad. Erling Haaland has scored just three times in 11 league matches, but despite speculation of a falling out with Guardiola, he leads the line. Man City starting lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Ortega (GK) — Lewis, Stones, Akanji, Gvardiol — Gundogan, Kovacic — Silva, Foden, Grealish — Haaland Man City subs: Walker, Ake, Doku, De Bruyne, Savinho, Carson, Simpson-Pusey, O'Reilly, McAtee Here's how to watch this Premier League match across selected areas of the world's major regions: If you purchase a product or register for an account through one of the links on our site, we may receive compensation.

                "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Representative Emilia Sykes (OH-13) applauded the U.S. Senate’s passage of the Social Security Fairness Act. The Social Security Fairness Act will eliminate the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) from the Social Security Act. Currently, public service employees are unable to receive their full Social Security benefits if they also receive other forms of retirement benefits, such as a pension. In November, Rep. Sykes voted in favor of the bipartisan Social Security Fairness Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives with an overwhelming bipartisan majority. The legislation now heads to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law. “The passage of this important legislation not only provides relief to thousands of my constituents who are frustrated they can’t receive their full Social Security benefits – it demonstrates what Congress is capable of when we work together in bipartisan fashion,” said Rep. Sykes. “There’s no good reason why teachers, firefighters, and other public service employees who have earned their retirement benefits should not receive them.” Rep. Sykes has worked in Congress to protect and expand Social Security benefits for Ohio’s 13th Congressional District.",

The legislation passed by a vote of 327-75, with one member voting “Present.” The bill would increase the Social Security benefit for many career fire and EMS personnel and their spouses. H.R 82 would repeal the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) is a modified benefit formula that reduces the Social Security benefits of certain retired or disabled workers, who also are entitled to pension benefits based on earnings from jobs that are not subject to the Social Security payroll tax. The Government Pension Offset (GPO) reduces the Social Security’s spouses’ or widows/ers’ benefits of most people who also receive a pension based on federal, state, or local government employment not covered by Social Security. The Senate still must vote on H.R. 82. The Senate companion bill (S. 597) was introduced by Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and has 62 cosponsors. \"The IAFC community of firefighters is pleased that the House has restored full Social Security benefits for us and other public service people. The two provisions of current law – the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) significantly impact the income and quality of life for retired firefighters.

                "content": "Patrick Lavon Mahomes II[5] (/məˈhoʊmz/;[6] born September 17, 1995) is an American professional football quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). Mahomes has led the Chiefs to six consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances and four Super Bowl appearances since becoming the team's starting quarterback in 2018. He is one of five quarterbacks in NFL history to win three or more Super Bowls as a starter.[7][8] Mahomes's career accolades through seven seasons in the NFL have earned him widespread praise from sports journalists, and he is considered to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[9][10][11] Mahomes played college football and baseball for the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Following his sophomore year, he quit baseball to focus solely on football.[12] In his junior year, he led all NCAA Division I FBS players in multiple categories including passing yards (5,052) and total touchdowns (53). He was selected 10th overall by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2017 NFL draft. Mahomes spent his rookie season as the backup to Alex Smith. He was named the starter in 2018 after the Chiefs traded Smith to the Washington Redskins. That season, Mahomes threw for 5,097 yards, 50 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. He became the only quarterback in history to throw for more than 5,000 yards in a single season in both college and in the NFL. He joined Peyton Manning as the only players in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 passing touchdowns in the same season.[13] For his performance in his first season as starter, he was named to the Pro Bowl, named first-team All-Pro, and won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year and NFL Most Valuable Player awards. Mahomes is one of four black quarterbacks to win the AP MVP award.[b][14] In the 2019 season, Mahomes led the Chiefs to Super Bowl LIV, their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years, where they defeated the San Francisco 49ers.[15] Mahomes was awarded the Super Bowl MVP for his performance, the second black quarterback and youngest overall to do so.[c][16] He is also the third African American quarterback to win a Super Bowl.[d] In 2020, Mahomes signed a 10-year contract extension worth $477 million with another $26 million in potential bonuses, for a total of $503 million, making it the fourth-largest known contract in sporting history.[18][19] The year after signing his contract, he led the Chiefs to their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance, but they lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV. In the 2022 season, Mahomes won his second career NFL MVP and his second Super Bowl MVP in Super Bowl LVII after the Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, becoming the first player to win NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP in the same year since Kurt Warner in 1999, and joined Tom Brady and Joe Montana as the only quarterbacks to win multiple regular season and Super Bowl MVPs.[20][21] In the 2023 season, he won his third Super Bowl MVP after the Chiefs defeated the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII. Mahomes was born on September 17, 1995, in Tyler, Texas.[22] His father is Pat Mahomes, a former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher,[23] and his mother is Randi Martin.[24] Mahomes has a younger brother, Jackson, who is a social media influencer.[25][26][27] Mahomes's parents divorced in 2006.[24] His half-brother through his father, Graham Walker, plays football at Brown.[28] He is also the godson of former MLB pitcher LaTroy Hawkins, who was his father's teammate on the Minnesota Twins.[29] Mahomes is biracial,[30] as his father is black[31] and his mother is white.[30] Mahomes attended Whitehouse High School in Whitehouse, Texas.[32] He played football, baseball, and basketball.[33] Mahomes believes that training in pitching and playing basketball improved his quarterback skills.[34] In football, he had 4,619 passing yards, 50 passing touchdowns, 948 rushing yards, and 15 rushing touchdowns as a senior in high school. In baseball, he threw a no-hitter with 16 strikeouts in a game his senior year.[35] He was named the Maxpreps Male Athlete of the Year for 2013–2014.[36] Mahomes was rated by Rivals.com as a three-star football recruit and was ranked as the 12th best dual-threat quarterback in his class. He received offers from Texas Tech, Rice, and Houston.[37] He committed to Texas Tech University.[38] Mahomes was also a top prospect for the 2014 Major League Baseball draft, but was not expected to be selected high due to his commitment to Texas Tech.[39][40][41] He was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 37th round of the 2014 MLB draft, but did not sign a contract.[42] Mahomes entered his freshman season at Texas Tech as a backup to Davis Webb.[43] He saw his first career action against the Oklahoma State Cowboys after Webb left the game with an injury, completing two of five passes for 20 yards for one touchdown and an interception.[44] After Webb was again injured, Mahomes started his first career game against the Texas Longhorns.[45] He completed 13 of 21 passes for 109 yards in the 34–13 loss.[46][47] Mahomes remained the starter for the season's final three games. Against the Baylor Bears, he threw for a Big 12 freshman record 598 yards with six touchdowns and one interception in the 48–46 loss.[48] For the season, he passed for 1,547 yards, 16 touchdowns, and four interceptions in seven games.[49] Mahomes split time with the Texas Tech baseball team, where he was a relief pitcher.[50][51] Mahomes began his sophomore season at Texas Tech as the starting quarterback. Mahomes helped lead the Red Raiders to a 7–6 season with numerous productive outings throughout the season.[52] He recorded ten games going over 350 passing yards, including four games going over 400. He passed for at least three touchdowns in eight of the games, including a five-touchdown performance against the Iowa State Cyclones on October 10.[53] Overall, in the 2015 season, he led the Big 12 Conference with 364 pass completions on 573 attempts for 4,653 yards, 36 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions.[54][55] Mahomes appeared in three games as a baseball player, recording no hits in two at bats, and three runs allowed, as a pitcher.[56] Prior to the start of the 2016 season, Mahomes announced that he was leaving baseball to focus on football.[50] Mahomes had a very productive junior season. In the month of September alone, Mahomes passed for 18 touchdowns to three interceptions while rushing for four touchdowns. He averaged 442.5 passing yards per game that month, which included a 540-yard game against the Arizona State Sun Devils in the Red Raiders' second game.[57] Mahomes started the month of October with 504 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and three rushing touchdowns in a losing effort to the Kansas State Wildcats.[58] On October 22, Mahomes set multiple NCAA, Big 12, and school records in a 66–59 loss to the Oklahoma Sooners at home. Mahomes broke the NCAA FBS records for single-game total offense with 819 yards. He tied the NCAA record for single game passing yards with 734. He fell one short of the record for most attempts at 88. Overall, the game set NCAA records for most combined yards of total offense with 1,708 combined passing yards, and total offense by two players (the other was Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield).[59] The 125 combined points are the second most all time involving ranked teams.[59] Following the Oklahoma game, the Red Raiders defeated the TCU Horned Frogs before dropping three consecutive games to finish outside bowl eligibility with a 5–7 record.

The locations will primarily be in the Kansas City metropolitan area and the Wichita, Kansas metropolitan area, and multiple locations in between the cities.[292] In 2024, Mahomes, along with the rest of the ownership group of the Current, expressed interest in bringing a WNBA expansion franchise to Kansas City. They cited the success of the Current, the WNBA expanding to add teams in San Francisco, Portland, and Toronto by 2026, and the WNBA hoping to have 16 teams by 2028. The bid is likely to have competition from other cities like St. Louis and Philadelphia.[293][294]",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs Mahomes was a multi-talented athlete before settling on football Patrick Mahomes is known for being one of the most talented quarterbacks to take the field in the NFL. However, the Chiefs star wasn't limited to just playing football when he was younger. During high school he was a talented basketball player, averaging more than 19 points and eight rebounds a game. He also showed his skills on the diamond, with his father having played in the MLB. As a result he spent countless hours playing with his dad, and could have perhaps pursued a career in baseball had things gone differently. Related: While taking part in a \"Would You Rather?\" promotion video with Jake from State Farm, Mahomes was asked whether he preferred basketball or baseball as his 'other sport' aside from football. Despite baseball being in the family, Mahomes went the other way and picked the hard court: \"100 percent basketball.\" Mahomes' basketball career was profiled by ESPN earlier this year. The piece included Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry complimenting Mahomes for his creativity on the court, though he noted that his jump shot needed some work. \"It goes in...in doesn't always have to be pretty. I'm not gonna shoot like Steph,\" was Mahomes' response. Known for his playmaking skills on the field and his ability to get away from defenders, Mahomes believes he developed those skills while playing basketball. \"The skills of playing the point guard position specifically really helped me... if you watch me scrambling around, it's the same thing,\" said Mahomes. \"I look like I'm moving slow, but I'm getting where I need to get to. And I feel like in basketball, I was the same way.\" © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "title": "Kirk Cousins - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Kirk Daniel Cousins (born August 19, 1988) is an American professional football quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Michigan State Spartans and was selected by the Washington Redskins in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL draft. Cousins ranks sixth all-time in completion percentage with at least 1,500 pass attempts[2] and is 11th in the NFL's all-time regular season career passer rating. Cousins spent his first three seasons with the Redskins as a backup to Robert Griffin III before replacing an injured Griffin in 2015 and leading the team to a division title. With Washington, Cousins set several franchise records and was named to the 2017 Pro Bowl. After two years of signing franchise tags and being unable to agree with the team on a long-term deal, Cousins signed a fully guaranteed three-year US$84 million contract with the Minnesota Vikings as a free agent in 2018. In six seasons with the Vikings, he earned three Pro Bowl selections and ranks third in the Vikings' all-time passing yards list. Cousins signed a four-year deal with the Falcons in 2024. Kirk Cousins was born to Don Cousins[3] and Maryann Cousins, the second oldest of their three children. Born in Barrington, Illinois[4][5] on August 19, 1988,[4] Cousins attended Holland Christian High School in Holland, Michigan, where he starred in football, baseball (as a third baseman and a pitcher), and basketball for the Maroons athletic teams. He broke his ankle in his junior year and was forced to attend camps in order to make an impression with recruiting colleges.[6] Cousins finished his high school football career with 3,204 passing yards, 40 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions.[7] After high school, Cousins was set to sign with Toledo or Western Michigan, until Mark Dantonio became the head coach at Michigan State in 2007. After Dantonio failed to sign his top targets at quarterback, he offered a scholarship to Cousins, which he accepted. He also participated in the Athletes in Action sports ministry.[citation needed] Sources: Cousins redshirted for the 2007 season.[8] In 2008, he spent the season as the backup quarterback to Brian Hoyer. He played in five games passing for a total of 310 yards and two touchdowns and one interception.[9][10] In 2009, he competed for and won the starting quarterback job against teammate Keith Nichol. He led Michigan State to a 6–7 (4–4) season with 19 touchdowns, nine interceptions and 2,680 passing yards in 12 games.[11] In 2010, he led Michigan State to an 11–2 (7–1) record and a share of the Big Ten Conference Championship.[12][13][14] In 2011, the Spartans went 11–3 (7–2) and played in the first-ever Big Ten Football Championship Game.[15][16] He led the Big Ten Conference in pass completions, pass attempts, and passing yards in 2011.[17] Cousins was named second-team All-Big Ten by the coaches, and played his final game as a Michigan State Spartan on January 2, 2012, defeating the Georgia Bulldogs in the Outback Bowl.[18] His teams posted an undefeated 4–0 record against the in-state rival Michigan Wolverines.[19] Cousins won the 2011 Lowes's Senior CLASS Award.[20] Cousins majored in kinesiology.[21] Cousins was selected by the Washington Redskins as the seventh choice in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL draft, making him the 102nd draft pick overall.[25] The pick surprised many analysts, as the Redskins had drafted 2011 Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III with the second overall pick to be their franchise quarterback. The Redskins acquired the Griffin pick by giving the St. Louis Rams four high-value draft picks over three years.[26] Cousins was viewed as an insurance policy in case Griffin was injured, with Redskins head coach Mike Shanahan saying \"You're one or two plays away from being the starter...And if I see that value out there on the third day of the draft, I'm going to take that.\"[27] The Redskins drafting Griffin and Cousins in the same draft echoed the team's strategy in the 1994 NFL draft, when the team drafted Heath Shuler with the third overall pick and later drafted Gus Frerotte in the seventh round.[28] On May 31, 2012, Cousins signed a four-year contract with the Redskins.[29] In the second game of the preseason against the Chicago Bears, Cousins threw three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, though the Redskins would go on to lose 33–31.[30] In the fourth and final game of preseason, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Cousins completed 15 of 27 passes for 222 yards as the Redskins won 30–3. He was named the backup quarterback over incumbent starter Rex Grossman. Cousins made his NFL debut in the third quarter of a Week 5 loss to the Atlanta Falcons after Griffin suffered a concussion. Cousins threw his first NFL touchdown pass on a 77-yard pass to Santana Moss but threw two interceptions in the last two series of the game while trying to tie the game.[31] Cousins' second NFL appearance came in Week 14 against the Baltimore Ravens. On the final drive of the game, with the Redskins down 8, Griffin suffered a knee injury. Cousins went 2–2 and finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Garçon with 29 seconds remaining, to bring the Redskins within 2 points of the Ravens. On the two-point conversion, Shanahan called for a run-pass option, and Cousins scored on a quarterback draw to tie the game at 28. The Redskins would win in overtime 31–28.[32] The following week, on December 15, 2012, Cousins was announced as the Redskins starter for the Week 15 game against the Cleveland Browns, marking his first NFL start.[33] After a slow first half, Cousins rallied the offense to a 28-point second half. Cousins finished the day 26-of-37 for 329 yards with 2 touchdown passes, bringing the Redskins a 38–21 win.[34][35] Later that week, Cousins was voted the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week, becoming the third Redskins rookie to receive the honor that season (after Griffin and Alfred Morris).[36] Cousins finished his rookie year with 466 passing yards, four touchdowns, and three interceptions in three games and one start.[37] The Redskins finished atop the NFC East with a 10–6 record.[38] In the Wild Card Round, they faced the Seattle Seahawks. In the 24–14 loss, Cousins came into the game late in the fourth quarter in relief of an injured Griffin. He finished the game 3-of-10 for 31 yards and was unable to rally the team to victory.[39] On December 11, 2013, Cousins was named starting quarterback for the rest of the year after Shanahan deactivated Robert Griffin III for the remainder of the season in order to protect him for the following year, with Rex Grossman as Cousins's backup.[40][41] In Week 15, in a narrow 27–26 loss to the Falcons, he finished 29-of-45 for 381 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.[42] Cousins finished his second professional season with 854 passing yards, four touchdowns, and seven interceptions in five games and three starts.[43] On February 2, 2014, it was reported that Cousins had stated that he was open to a trade from the Redskins.[44] In March, Cousins announced that he would be giving the #12 jersey to incoming new wide receiver Andre Roberts for the price of a $12,000 donation to the Kirk Cousins Football Camp. Cousins then switched over to the #8 jersey, a number he wore throughout his high school and college career.[45] During Week 2 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Cousins came in relief of Griffin who left the game with a dislocated ankle. Cousins finished the game with 250 passing yards and two touchdowns in a 41–10 victory.[46] In the next game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Cousins threw for 427 yards, the first game he had over 400 passing yards. Washington still lost an ensuing slugfest to the Eagles 37–34.[47] The following week against the New York Giants, Cousins had a poor showing, throwing for a touchdown with four interceptions and a lost fumble.[48] The Redskins were blown out 45–14 with a total of 6 turnovers. In Week 5, against the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks, Cousins showed progress from the embarrassing loss to the Giants by throwing for two touchdowns without an interception, including a 68-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson. Despite the solid performance from Cousins, the Redskins lost by a score of 27–17.[49] Following a poor performance in the first half in the Week 7 game against the Tennessee Titans, he was benched at halftime in favor of backup quarterback Colt McCoy, and did not play in any more games for the remainder of the season.[50] On August 31, 2015, Cousins was named the starter for the season over Robert Griffin III.[51] On October 4, Cousins led a 90-yard game-winning drive against the Eagles, his first since 2012, when he threw a touchdown pass to Pierre Garçon with under a minute left in the fourth quarter, winning the game 23–20.[52] On October 25, Cousins helped lead the Redskins to their largest comeback win in franchise history. After being down 24–0 in the second quarter against the Buccaneers at home, Cousins finished with 317 yards and four total touchdowns, three passing and one rushing, throwing the final touchdown pass to Jordan Reed in the final seconds of the game.[53] Cousins also tied a franchise record for completions in a game with 33, tying Jason Campbell who did the same in 2007. When heading into the locker room after the game, Cousins was caught on camera shouting, \"You like that?!\" to reporters, which later become a catchphrase used by Cousins, his teammates, and Redskins fans throughout the rest of the season.[54] Cousins and his brother Kyle applied to trademark the catchphrase later in the season and began to sell T-shirts with the phrase to raise money for the International Justice Mission charitable organization.[55][56][57][58] He was named National Football Conference (NFC) Offensive Player of the Week for his game against Tampa Bay.[59] Against the New Orleans Saints on November 15, Cousins threw for a career-high four touchdowns, as well as posting a perfect passer rating of 158.3, making him the first Redskins quarterback since 1950 to do that with at least 20 attempts.[a][60][61] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game against the Saints.[62] Against the Buffalo Bills on December 20, Cousins passed for four touchdowns, and ran for another in a Redskins victory, marking his second four-touchdown passing game of the season.[63] The following week against the Eagles, Cousins took an ill-advised quarterback kneel inside the Eagles' redzone with six seconds left before halftime, running out the clock and forgoing any chance of adding upon Washington's lead.[64] Despite that, Cousins eventually passed for four touchdowns in the game, his second consecutive four-touchdown performance and third overall on the season. The performance led to the Redskins' victory over the Eagles with a score of 38–24, which allowed the team to win the NFC East division title for the first time since Griffin III did it in 2012.[65][66] Cousins was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[67] Cousins finished the 2015 season posting the highest completion percentage (74.7) in home games in NFL history, with a minimum of 100 attempts, leading the Redskins to a 6–2 record at home.[68] He also became the first Redskins quarterback since Sonny Jurgensen in 1970 to have at least four passing touchdowns in three or more games in one season.[69] Against the Dallas Cowboys on January 3, 2016, he set the Redskins single-season passing yardage record with 4,166, passing Jay Schroeder who had 4,109 in 1986.[70] He also finished the season with 29 passing touchdowns, second in Redskins history behind Jurgensen who had 31 in 1967, while posting a league-leading completion percentage of 69.8%, second in team history behind Sammy Baugh who completed 70.3% of his passes in 1945.[70] Against the Green Bay Packers in the Wild Card Round on January 10, 2016, Cousins completed 29-of-46 passes for 329 yards and scored two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing), but was sacked six times and lost one fumble. The Redskins lost 35–18, ending their season.[71] He was named the PFWA Most Improved Player.[72] He was ranked 85th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[73] Cousins was set to become an unrestricted free agent in the 2016 offseason, but the Redskins used the non-exclusive franchise tag on him on March 1, 2016. The tag acted as a one-year, $20 million contract, which prevented other teams in the league from signing him without giving up two first round draft picks to the Redskins.[74][75] During the Week 8 International Series game against the Cincinnati Bengals at Wembley Stadium in London, Cousins threw for a career-high 458 passing yards, as the game ended in a 27–27 tie.[76] As the game ended in a tie, it also marked the first time a game held in London went into overtime. Three weeks later against the Packers, Cousins threw for 375 yards along with three touchdowns in a 42–24 victory, earning him his third NFC Offensive Player of the Week award.[77] After the game, Cousins was caught on camera asking Redskins general manager Scot McCloughan \"How you like me now?\" which many in the media believed Cousins was addressing concerns about his potentially lucrative long-term contract with the team next season.[78] In a Thanksgiving Day 31–26 road loss against the Cowboys, Cousins completed 41 of 53 passes for 449 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions, putting him second on the list of most passing yards in a Thanksgiving Day game in NFL history.[79] For his accomplishments in the month of November, Cousins won the NFC Offensive Player Of The Month award, his second time winning the award.[80][81] In Week 16, on Christmas Eve, against the Bears, Cousins had a career-high two rushing touchdowns in the 41–21 road victory.[82] Despite missing the playoffs, Cousins led the team to a winning record of 8–7–1 and finished the season with a career-high 4,917 passing yards, which was third in the NFL behind Drew Brees and Matt Ryan, breaking various personal and team records he had set the previous year.[83][84] Cousins' 67% completion percentage ranked No. 7 and his 45.7% deep-ball completion percentage ranked No. 5 among NFL quarterbacks in 2016.[85] Due to his performance in the season, Cousins was named to his first Pro Bowl, replacing Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, who could not take part in the game due to the Falcons' appearance in Super Bowl LI.[86] During the game, Cousins played throughout most of the second half, and notably forced a fumble on Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib after chasing him down the field after throwing an interception late in the fourth quarter.[87] Cousins was also ranked 70th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[88] Again set to become an unrestricted free agent in the offseason, Cousins and the Redskins attempted to work out a long-term deal before the start of free agency, but could only come to an agreement on the exclusive franchise tag on February 28, 2017, becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to be franchise-tagged in consecutive years.[89] During a Week 3 27–10 victory over the Oakland Raiders on NBC Sunday Night Football, Cousins went 25-for-30 for a season-high 365 yards and three touchdowns, earning him his fourth NFC Offensive Player of the Week award of his career.[90][91][92] During Week 10 against the Minnesota Vikings, Cousins tied his single-game career-high with two rushing touchdowns in the 38–30 loss.[93] The Redskins finished the 2017 season with a 7–9 record and missed the playoffs.[94] Cousins finished the season 347-of-540 for 4,093 yards, 27 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions.[95] The 2017 season marked his third consecutive season of passing for at least 4,000 yards. In addition to his passing totals, he rushed 49 times for 179 yards and four rushing touchdowns. Cousins was ranked 94th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.[96] On March 15, 2018, Cousins signed with the Vikings on a fully guaranteed three-year contract worth $84 million.[97] This was the first fully guaranteed and, as of signing, highest paying contract in NFL history.[98] In his Vikings debut in the season opener against the San Francisco 49ers, Cousins passed for 244 yards and two touchdowns in the 24–16 victory.[99] In the next game against the Packers, he finished with 425 passing yards, four touchdowns, and an interception as the game ended in a 29–29 tie.[100] Two weeks later against the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday Night Football, Cousins threw for 422 yards and three touchdowns in the 38–31 road loss.[101] Despite Cousins's strong statistical start to the season, inconsistency within the offense and coaching staff ended up impacting the Vikings' season. With the Vikings at 6–5–1 going into Week 14 against the Seahawks, the Vikings were still in the playoff hunt, but a 21–7 road loss on Monday Night Football resulted in the firing of offensive coordinator John DeFilippo.[102] The Vikings won their next two games, against the Miami Dolphins and Detroit Lions, with Cousins passing for five touchdowns and an interception combined.[103][104] In the regular-season finale against the Bears, the Vikings would have made the playoffs with a win, but they fell 24–10, with Cousins passing for 132 yards and a touchdown.[105] Cousins finished his first season with the Vikings with 4,298 passing yards, 30 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions to go along with 123 rushing yards and a touchdown.[106] He was ranked 78th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[107] During the season-opener against the Falcons, Cousins completed 8 of 10 passes for 98 yards and a touchdown in the 28–12 win.[108] In the next game against the Packers, he completed 14 passes for 230 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions in the 21–16 road loss.[109] The following week against the Raiders, Cousins completed 15 passes for 174 yards, including a 35-yard touchdown pass, in the 34–14 win.[110] In Week 4, against the Bears, he had two fumbles and no passing touchdowns but still passed 27 times for 233 yards in the 16–6 road loss.[citation needed] In the next game, against the Giants, Cousins completed 22 passes for 306 yards and two touchdowns in the 28–10 road victory.[111] The following week against the Eagles, he threw for 333 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception in the 38–20 win.[112] During Week 7 against the Lions, Cousins passed for 337 yards and four touchdowns in the 42–30 road victory.[113] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for October.[114] During Week 11 against the Broncos, Cousins threw for 319 yards and three touchdowns as the Vikings overcame a 20-point first half deficit and won 27–23.[115] Two weeks later against the Seahawks on Monday Night Football, he threw for 276 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the 37–30 road loss, extending Cousins' record on Mondays to an 0–8 record.[116] During Week 16 against the Packers once again on Monday Night Football, Cousins threw for 122 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the 23–10 loss.[117] The Packers clinched the NFC North division title with the win. It also extended Cousins' record on Monday Night Football to 0–9.[118] With the Vikings' playoff position set, Cousins did not play in the regular-season finale against the Bears.[119] He finished the 2019 season with 3,603 passing yards, 26 passing touchdowns, and six interceptions to go along with 63 rushing yards and a touchdown.[120] Cousins was also named to his second career Pro Bowl.[121] In the NFC Wild Card Round against the Saints, Cousins threw for 242 yards and the game winning touchdown to tight end Kyle Rudolph in overtime during the 26–20 road victory.[122] In the Divisional Round against the 49ers, Cousins threw for 172 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the 27–10 road loss.[123] He was ranked 58th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[124] On March 18, 2020, Cousins signed a two-year, $66 million contract extension with the Vikings.[125] During Week 2 against the Indianapolis Colts, Cousins threw for 113 yards and three interceptions during the 28–11 road loss. He finished the game with a total quarterback rating of 15.9, the third-lowest mark in Vikings franchise history.[126] In Week 3 against the Titans, Cousins had a much better outing, throwing for 251 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions during the narrow 31–30 loss.[127] The following week against the Houston Texans, Cousins threw for 260 yards and a touchdown during the 31–23 road victory, the Vikings' first win of the season.[128] Two weeks later against the Falcons, Cousins threw for 343 yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions during the 40–23 loss. He threw all three interceptions in the first half of the game.[129] Three weeks later against the Lions, he threw for 220 yards and three touchdowns on only 13 completions during the 34–20 win.[130] In Week 10 against the Bears on Monday Night Football, Cousins threw for 292 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the 19–13 road victory. This was Cousins' first ever Monday Night Football win after previously going 0–9 in his career.[131] During Week 11 against the Cowboys, Cousins threw for 318 yards and three touchdowns during the 31–28 loss.[132] In the next game against the Carolina Panthers, he threw for 307 yards and three touchdowns in the narrow 28–27 comeback victory.

The Falcons did not notify Cousins or his agent of the decision until they were on the clock with their pick.[189][190] Cousins made his Falcons debut on September 8 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, completing 16-of-26 passes for 155 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions, including a costly interception late in the fourth quarter as the Falcons were shutout in the second half, losing 18–10.[191] The following week against the Eagles on Monday Night Football, Cousins went 20-of-29 for 241 yards and two touchdowns.

Kirk Cousins: And so that’s when he, again, reiterated Proverbs 3:5 and 6, “Trust in the Lord with all your heart. Don’t lean on your understanding.” My understanding said that I couldn’t play college football, but don’t lean on your understanding. In all your ways, acknowledge him, trust him, walk with him, and he will direct your steps. And so, my job was to trust and obey, and it was God’s job to steer the ship. John: Kirk is our featured guest today on Focus on the Family and shares more inspiration about being a disciple of Jesus Christ. This is Focus on the Family with your host, Focus president and author, Jim Daly, and I’m John Fuller. Jim Daly: John, Kirk Cousins is an incredibly humble man, and he’s all about living his life in a purposeful and focused way. He’s a pro-ball quarterback, plays for the Minnesota Vikings. And some of you might know, unfortunately, we were sad to hear that he was injured in a game last week, so pray for Kirk, uh, to have that speedy recovery. He either holds or is tied for several NFL records. He’s very accomplished. Uh, football is a big part of his life and he wants to be the best player he can be, and that’s great. But his ultimate goal i- in life is so much bigger. It’s about serving the Lord, his family and others that he can help. Uh, he and his wife, Julie, have two sons and his dad, Don, is the lead pastor at Discovery Church in Orlando, Florida. Not long ago we recorded Kirk’s, uh, story in front of a live audience at that church, and it was very inspiring. I wasn’t able to be there, so I asked our very talented, uh, chief operating officer, Ken Windebank, to step in and, uh, record this with Kirk Cousins. Uh, by the way, our friend Ray Vander Laan from That the World May Know, we’ve been doing that series for over 25 years, will be mentioned. And, uh, Kirk Cousins went to his high school, Holland Christian School. He was Kirk’s teacher and he really has continued to be a spiritual mentor for Kirk Cousins. John: Yeah, and you’ll hear about that as we go along. And Ray Vander Laan has partnered with Focus on the Family to release a new video series. It’s called RVL Discipleship: The Study. It’s phenomenal and you can learn more at focusonthefamily.com/broadcast or when you call 800, the letter A, and the word FAMILY. Here now is Ken Windebank with Kirk Cousins from a men’s event in Orlando on Focus on the Family. Ken Windebank: Kirk, thanks for joining me and congratulations on the 2023 Bart Starr Award for outstanding character and leadership in the home, on the field and in the community. That is, that’s some accolade, uh, for you. Kirk: Well, thank you. It was a meaningful award. You certainly play for team awards, but, uh- Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: … of the individual awards I’ve had the chance to even be considered for, that one, uh, carries the most meaning because of what it stands for. Ken: Right, without a doubt. Uh, I don’t know if you know, but there’s a lot of similarities between you and me, you know? Kirk: (laughs) Are there? Ken: So, I grew up in the suburbs of New York. You grew up in the suburbs of Chicago. I’m a middle child, you’re a middle child. Kirk: There you go. Ken: I played quarterback in high school. Kirk: All right. Ken: You played quarterback in high school. You aspired to be an NFL quarterback, I aspired to be an NFL quarterback. Kirk: Yes (laughs). Audience: (laughing) Kirk: (laughs) How’d that work out for you? Ken: You’re an inc- You’re in incredible shape- Audience: (laughing) Ken: … and that’s where everything ends right about there. Kirk: (laughs) Audience: (laughing) Ken: So, it didn’t work out, but I had a great time in sports, uh. Kirk: No doubt. Ken: Now, when you were a toddler, you had an accident that, uh, maybe jeopardized your sports career, um, and playing sports. What happened? Tell us about that. Kirk: Yeah. I was about 18 months old and, um, just one of those freak accidents at the home where, uh, there’s boiling water. And I got ahold of it and poured it on myself, not knowing what I was doing. And when you pour boiling water on and you have clothes on, my mom came running over, my shirt was stuck to my skin. She goes to pull my shirt off and my skin comes off with it. Ken: Mm. Kirk: And I’m screaming, and my mom calls 911. And they take me away in an ambulance and, um, I, thankfully, have no memory of it. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: But I was in the hospital for two weeks, and they had to do a daily process to help with the healing of the skin where I would go sit in a warm bath. And obviously, when you have burn… severely burned skin- Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: … and you’re sitting in, in water, it’s extremely painful. And so I was screaming and my parents had to just kinda hold me through that for two weeks. And thankfully, the, a lot of the scarring is gone. It’s just a couple spots in my arm here and here that, where the scarring is permanent. But, um, it’s very interesting because when my parents left the hospital after two weeks, the doctor said, “No long-term implication. Obviously, cosmetically, there might be some implication, but nothing, nothing functionally, except he will have some limited movement in his shoulders,” which to this day is still where the most significant scarring is- Ken: Right. Kirk: … is, is around my, my armpits. And they said, uh, “For example, that could, that could hurt him in terms of like throwing a ball.” Ken: Right. Kirk: And so, it was very interesting that that- Audience: (laughing) Kirk: … be, that that was the, the thought coming away from that. Um, but obviously, that, that was not the case. Ken: Right. Kirk: And I can throw a football just fine, so very, very grateful for that. And if there is a silver lining to it, which I think there is, we believe to this day that maybe, uh, those two weeks of going through those painful process to help heal may have helped toughen me up in some way, shape or form. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: Because to this day, football requires a high pain threshold and pain tolerance and an ability to push through physical pain. And while I don’t like doing it, it would seem that there’s an ability there, and we wonder if maybe that experience was what maybe raised my pain threshold. Ken: You know, I, I think we can look in the news today and a lot of, a lot of young people are struggling with identity and issues of who they are and… What is the message that you would carry to young people today in that regard, pushing through and, um- Kirk: Yeah. Ken: … embracing those things in your life that are difficult? Kirk: Well, it can be very easy to, um, wrap your identity up into what you do, how you look, what people think of you. And if you do that in my job, you don’t get too far- Ken: Mm. Kirk: … because someday football, you’re gonna retire. Your skills are gonna decline. And, uh, you’re constantly under criticism from media and fans. Rarely are people saying nice things about you over and over. It tends to be criticism and nitpicking. Ken: Right. Kirk: And so that comes with the job. And so, um, if you’re waiting for people to tell you you’re… y- you know, good things about you and have this everything go right in your career, in my job you’re gonna be waiting a long time- Ken: Right. Kirk: … to have your identity wrapped up in something that’s gonna make you feel good. So for me, it was a lesson I learned long ago. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: I threw an interception in a college game at Notre Dame. Ken: Mm. Kirk: And I remember it was a interception that cost our team the game. Ken: Mm. Kirk: We lost the game because I threw the interception, and I got hit on the play. So I landed hard into the turf, and I remember walking, picking myself up off turf- Ken: Mm. Kirk: … walking off the field, listening to the deafening sound of 80,000 people in the stadium cheering my failure. Ken: Right. Kirk: Because it was a away game. Ken: Wow. Kirk: And I’m pulling a clump of grass out of my helmet ’cause I got hit into the turf so hard. Ken: Mm. Kirk: And I’m thinking, “Life isn’t too good right now.” Ken: Right. Kirk: But another thought was, “If I had built my life on football and that was where my identity was, I’m in trouble right now because football just crumbled.” Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: And I thought, “Thank you for the gospel.” Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: “And thank you, God, that my life is not built on football.” Ken: Right. Kirk: But my life’s built on you and you’re not changing. Ken: Right. Kirk: And so I can throw an interception and be pulling turfgrass out of my helmet and have to go face questions from the n- the media in 10 minutes that are gonna ask, why are you so dumb? (laughs) Ken: Right. Kirk: And I can face all that knowing that God’s not changing. God saw this event before it happened. He’s sovereign over it. He allowed it to happen, and I have to trust him- Ken: Mm. Kirk: … that he’s gonna make good out of it and he’s not gonna waste it. Ken: Right. Kirk: And when you have that as your underlying comfort and peace and foundation of your life, it goes back to the words of Jesus in Matthew where he says, “You’re building your house on rock.” Ken: Amen. Kirk: And the storm is gonna come. You’re gonna throw interceptions. Ken: Right. Kirk: They might lose you games, but the house won’t fall apart. Ken: Right. Kirk: It’ll be standing on the rock. And so for me, I’m grateful that my life is built on the rock. I don’t want the storms to come, but when they do, uh, we’ve got the right foundation. Ken: Well, obviously, a lot of people have spoken into your life and built that into your life, your family, um, being one of them. Talk a little bit about your family life growing up and, and what your parents poured into you- Kirk: Yep. Ken: … in that regard, in regard to building that foundation and that outlook in life. Kirk: Yeah. My parents did a great job, first of all, modeling what it would look like to follow Jesus. Um, they didn’t push us or force the Bible on us. I felt like it was something that was caught and taught. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: And it was just a natural thing to want to, uh, follow their path that they had laid out. You know, my dad taught us scripture from a young age and brought up Proverbs 3, 5 and 6, um, you know, to trust in the Lord with all your heart, to not lean on your understanding. In all your ways to acknowledge him- Ken: Hmm. Kirk: … and he will direct your steps. And, um, he taught us Galatians 6:7, you know, which says, “Do not be deceived, God is not mocked. Whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.” Ken: Right. Kirk: And he talked about the importance of being a great decision maker and knowing that there are consequences- Ken: Right. Kirk: … to the choices you make in life, good or bad. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: And if you sow good things, you’ll reap good things. But if you sow poor decisions, you’ll reap poor decisions. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: And so, you know, the truth of God’s word was evident in the home. And, uh, whether it was my mom or my dad, it was very clear what it would look like to follow Jesus, what it would look like to shine a light to other people- Ken: Mm. Kirk: … in, in your school and on your sports teams. And it was a passion of theirs that we really caught. Ken: That’s great. Let’s turn to high school. Uh, sometimes can be difficult years. You played quarterback at Holland Christian. And we have a common friend in Ray Vander Laan. Kirk: Yes. Ken: I don’t know if you have all heard That the World May Know at Focus on the Family. It’s a great series that we’ve done with Ray for 30 years, incredible biblical teaching, incredible biblical scholar. I’ve learned a lot from him at my time at Focus on the Family. Uh, was able to go to Israel with him. I know you did as well. Talk a little bit about what stands out from his teaching in the classroom. You know, sometimes it can be very academic in the classroom, but you know, my times with Ray and personally, uh, there’s something about his teaching that moves you out of the classroom- Kirk: Right. Ken: … from an academic standpoint- Kirk: Right. Ken: … into walking like Jesus walked. I mean it’s- Kirk: Yep. I took two classes with Ray. My sophomore year of high school was Life of Jesus. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: And that was a semester, and, uh, he just made the Bible and the life of Jesus just come to life. Ken: Wow. Kirk: He’s just a gifted teacher. Ken: He is. Kirk: Unbelievable storyteller and, uh, he brought so much truth out of the scriptures that I never realized or knew were there, even growing up in a home where we were around the Bible all the time. Ken: Right. Kirk: And then my senior year, I took a course called Discipleship, where he talked about it’s one thing to be a fan of Jesus. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: It’s another thing to be a fully devoted follower. Ken: Right. Kirk: And he talked about the definition of being a disciple is to be a fully devoted follower. And he challenged us to understand that that meant following Jesus even if it costs you something. Ken: Right. Kirk: So if culture goes this way and Jesus went this way, if you’re a disciple, you gotta go this way- Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: … even if it costs you something. And so I, I felt from his challenging teachings in high school and through some of the experiences I’ve had in sports, I just drove a stake in the ground late in high school that I’m gonna be a fully devoted follower- Ken: Right. Kirk: … even if it costs me something. And, uh, I’m gonna trust him and build my life on, on his truth. And, uh, you know, through those ups and downs and the rollercoaster of life, it makes all the difference. Ken: Right. Kirk: And so, um, Ray’s teaching was a, was a foundational impact on my life. Ken: Now, you had a moment in high school where you had something that occurred to you that- Kirk: Mm-hmm. Ken: … again, put your sports career in jeopardy. Kirk: Yeah. Ken: Um, tell us what happened. Kirk: Yeah. So, I, uh, and I joke with NFL players to this day that I did not play varsity football until my junior year. Most pro football players probably were good enough as a freshman or sophomore to get pulled up to the varsity. I, that was not the case for me. I played freshman football as a freshman, JV as a sophomore, and then my first varsity game was my junior year. And in the very first quarter of the very first varsity game I ever played, which was a dream come true for me to be a quarterback at my high school on the varsity team, I got hit on my left side in that first quarter and broke my left ankle. And the doctor put the cast on my ankle and told me I was likely done for the season. If I did come back, I wouldn’t really be the same player. And I remember driving home from the hospital with tears in my eyes and calling my dad and saying, “Dad, it’s broken. I’m out for the year. Now I won’t get recruited and by the time I get to my senior year, assuming I have a good year, who knows if that will happen, all the good schools will have already found their guy, and I won’t get an opportunity.” And my dad said, “Kirk, you don’t know that. But even if it doesn’t happen, even if you don’t get a scholarship and football does go south because of this injury, you have to trust God’s plan for your life, and you have to believe that he has a plan.” And so that’s when he, again, reiterated Proverbs 3:5 and 6, “Trust in the Lord with all your heart. Don’t lean on your understanding.” My understanding said that I couldn’t play college football, but don’t lean on your understanding. In all your ways, acknowledge him. Trust him, walk with him, and he will direct your steps. And so, my job was to trust and obey, and it was God’s job to steer the ship. And I decided in that moment, ‘kay, that’ll be my life first, and I’m gonna truly live that. I’m gonna trust and obey even when it’s hard and I don’t feel like it, and we’ll see where he wants to steer the ship. Ken: Hmm. Kirk: It might not be football, but let’s let him steer the ship, not me. Ken: Right. Kirk: And I’m not gonna worry about it. And sh- a year and a half later, I was signing a scholarship to go to Michigan State, which would have been my dream school all along. And it was just a moment where I could look back and say, “God is so much bigger than not only a broken ankle-” Ken: Amen. Right. Kirk: … “but bigger than the circumstances we see in our lives.” The key is that through those circumstances, we trust him, obey him, and give those circumstances over to him. Ken: Right. You’ve mentioned your dad several times, and that’s, that’s quite moving that you can pick up the phone and have that relationship with your father and your heavenly father. Uh, you know, you see both of those things in your life. You know, a year and a half is a long time to come back from an ankle injury. Was there any specific moment that you really felt like, I don’t know if I can do this during that time? Did, did your dad speak life into you? Was there any, any moments that, that occur? Kirk: Yeah. I think time and again, my dad has spoken belief in me. I mean, to this day I’ll have a poor game and I’ll inevitably call him on my way back from the game or when we get home. And he always has a way of communicating glass half full. Ken: Yeah. Kirk: You know, but yep, those were bad throws, but think about the good throws you had and, and these moments. And so there are a lot of, uh, times where he can help me right my perspective. Ken: Right. Kirk: And so, for me, as I look at our society and I think about how can we fix societal issues, obviously the first thing I go to is the gospel, but to the degree that the gospel will be pushed back on, I then go to dads. Ken: Mm. Kirk: We need dads to be dads. Ken: Amen. Kirk: And we need men to lead and fathers to lead. I just see too many times I look around our locker room, teammates’ stories where there was just no dad present in their life. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: And if the dad was present, he really wasn’t a dad- Ken: Right. Kirk: … as I define a dad. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: And, and when I think back on the role that my dad played, if he had just been removed from the picture, I would’ve been lost. Ken: Right. Kirk: And so when I look at bigger issues in society, I keep seeing politicians give speeches and I say, “Why are we not talking about dads?” Ken: Right. Kirk: We need dads to be dads, and we have so many who aren’t. And it’s hard. I’m a dad and I’m learning just how hard it is. And so I can see why people are tapping out and saying, “I don’t wanna do this.” Ken: Right. Kirk: But we have to press in and lead because I go back to so many issues stemming from, well, where was the father and what was the role he was playing? John: This is Focus on the Family, and that’s NFL quarterback Kirk Cousins. And he’s speaking with Focus on the Family’s Ken Windebank. Now, Kirk was a high school student in Ray Vander Laan’s Bible classes. And, uh, Ray has a new video series released with Focus on the Family called RVL Discipleship: The Study. This is really an amazing series of Bible lessons that unpack what it means to be a follower of Jesus. And you can learn more about this resource at focusonthefamily.com/broadcast. Let’s go ahead and rejoin Ken Windebank and Kirk Cousins on Focus on the Family. Ken: All right. You’re, let’s turn a corner. You’re off to college, okay. And, um, statistically, we know that a lot of young people lose their faith in college. They walk away from Christ. It’s a moment that many parents, Christian parents, they’re excited about launching their kids off into university, but some are nervous, uh, about that. You obviously had a great, a great foundation, but, uh, talk to us a little bit about being at Michigan State and what maybe tested your faith and how you, how you stayed strong in your faith and who you pulled in around you. Kirk: I remember as I left for Michigan State, um, listening to some message tapes on the Book of Daniel. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: And it so paralleled what it’s like to be a freshman in college. You know, Daniel was plucked from Israel, was placed in Babylon. He was identified as someone with abilities, and so they wanted to brainwash him and, and take the Israel part out of him- Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: … and make sure he became like the Babylonians and have him forget all that he was raised to be and become someone else. And Daniel was aware of that and wasn’t going to do it if it meant disobeying God. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: And so, he stood his ground and said, “I’m, I’m not going to cross these lines, uh, ’cause it would mean I would have to go against my conscience and disobey God.” Ken: Mm. Kirk: And God honored that. Ken: Right. Kirk: And so, for me, I, I just felt going to Michigan State, I was raised a certain way. I knew there were gonna be all kinds of temptations in college, and it was gonna be important that I stand my ground and say, “Even if it costs me something, I’m not gonna do that.” Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: And, um, God provided the grace to be able to do that. He also, uh, provided people around me so I wasn’t alone. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: You know, it wasn’t the whole locker room, but there were four or five guys that I could do life with- Ken: Right. Kirk: … where I didn’t feel like I was alone. And I think God does provide those people for us. And college was really a key moment where, okay, you’re leaving your home, you now have to stand on your own. You talked about being a fully devoted follower- Ken: Right, right. Kirk: … in high school. That sounded good- Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: … but now the boots are hitting the ground. Do you really want to do that? Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: And, um, and so my freshman year, sophomore year of college were really impactful years to be able to drive that stake deeper in the ground and say, “No, I’ve built my life on the truth of God’s word. That’s the playbook for my life, and I’m not gonna deviate even if it might make me look strange to my peers in college.” Ken: Right. You’ve talked about three big decisions you need to make in your life, your master, your mate, and your mission. Kirk: Yeah. Ken: Tell us about those. Kirk: Well, certainly, you know, the most important decision you can make in life is to bend the knee at the cross and give your life to Jesus and give your sin to Jesus and trust him. And so that’s who’s gonna be your master, what are you gonna build your life for. And then your mate being your spouse. Those of us who are going to get married or are married, you understand the importance of the marriage relationship and, and how it pictures Christ and the church and, and how we become, you know, that message to our world. And so who you’re gonna marry is, is a big decision. And, uh, and then certainly what you’re gonna do in life, uh, for your occupation, for your calling is a, is a big deal. And so, when you get those three decisions right, you set yourself up well in life for a lot of success. Ken: Right. Kirk: And if you get one of those three decisions wrong, you can enter into a, a lot of challenges. Ken: Yeah, a lot of chaos, potentially. So let’s turn to, uh, the NFL. It’s a, again, y- there’s a spotlight on you. Everything you say, everything you do- Kirk: Yeah. Ken: … is in the news. It’s difficult managing your faith and being in the locker room. Ta- talk to us about how you approach your teammates, how you approach the locker room with your faith, and how you do that every single day, day in and day out. And hopefully, we can take that back to our workplace or our school. Kirk: Yeah. I think it’s important to, first of all, walk the walk. So if I sit here with you and talk about being somebody and then I’m not that person on a day-to-day basis, I’ve lost any effectiveness for shining a light or sharing the gospel. So, I need to be the person that I like to think I am (laughs), first of all, and walk the walk. But then, um, I think it’s important to really lead and invest in teammates’ lives so that they know that I care a great deal about their success on the football field, not just my own. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: And then from there, you certainly wanna use opportunities to share your faith. Ken: Right. Kirk: And you want them to be natural and not forced and, you know. But you certainly try to take advantage of those opportunities when they present themselves. Ken: Right. You know, one of the things I learned from Ray on the trip was this idea of taking the kingdom back one inch at a time. Kirk: Yes. Ken: And sometimes I think we, we think we need to do big things. Kirk: Right. Ken: And it’s, it’s great to be able to do those things. You have an incredible platform to be able to really kinda move the needle in people’s lives with, you know, who you are- Kirk: Yeah. Ken: … and what the Lord has afforded you. But what I think when I think of the locker room, I think of that comes to mind- Kirk: Yes. Ken: … is hey, one inch at a time. Kirk: That’s a good word. Ken: And really being intentional about the guys that are across from you and paying attention, uh, to them. Kirk: I agree. Ken: Yeah. Kirk: I think, I think it is inch by inch. And if we expect big things, we’ll get discouraged. Ken: Yeah. Kirk: I think we do have to almost expect it to be inch by inch and then allow God to do those big things from time to time. But, um, the expectation should be that just daily faithfulness of shining our light, being bold, uh, even if it is just inches is faithfulness and, and obedience to God. Ken: Being in an environment that you’re in, it’s, uh, you know, it’s entertainment, you know? And the NFL, it’s a great sport. I’ve loved it all my life. Uh, but it can be a very secular environment- Kirk: Mm-hmm. Ken: … a very difficult environment. Uh, like you said earlier, a lot of temptations that as you enter into, you know, in college and I think even more so in the NFL. Talk to me, share with us how you strengthen your faith. What routine do you go through? What are the daily things that you do to make sure- Kirk: Yeah. Ken: … that you’re, that you’re not just coasting? Kirk: Well, to this day, God has always provided a remnant. So there’s that half dozen guys in every locker room I’ve been in that walk with God and that I can do life with. So, you never are in total isolation. I think it’s important to find those people- Ken: Right. Kirk: … in your area of life so that you don’t feel like you’re alone, uh, understanding it won’t be the majority, likely. And we, so we have a chapel gathering Saturday nights before games, which is a real positive, uh, time, closest thing that we have to a church service, being that we’re playing on Sundays. And then on Monday night, we have a couples Bible study. On, uh, Tuesday, I try to take a sabbath, which is a real spiritual thing for me- Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: … to truly take the day off, rest, and trust God that if I’m not in the building working, he can do more with six days than I can do with seven. Ken: Hmm. Kirk: And so Tuesday becomes a real spiritual experience for me to just rest and trust him. And then, uh, uh, we also have on Thursday morning a prayer gathering, uh, with teammates just before the workday starts because we just feel like we need to begin our work week or our workday in prayer and give it over to the Lord and not begin it in pride- Ken: Mm. Kirk: … where we think we have all the answers and don’t need to pray. So, um, it’s important for me to just always be in the word, be in prayer, and be in community with other believers. Ken: Let’s, let’s end on this, on this question. Uh, I got a phone call from a, another mutual friend not too lon- a few years back talking about a piece of artwork that was really- Kirk: Yeah. Ken: … important to you- Kirk: Yeah. Ken: … in the That the World May Know series. Kirk: Yes. Ken: And I, I have to be honest with you. When I had heard what you wanted to do with that painting, I’m getting choked up now. Kirk: (laughs) Yes. Ken: … having young boys, it was moving- Kirk: Yeah. Ken: … to think about that. Talk to us about, about that piece of artwork, what you’ve done with it- Kirk: Yep. Ken: … and what’s your intention for your boys? Kirk: So, so Ray, uh, when he went to, Ray Vander Laan, when he would lead Israel trips, Focus on the Family commissioned a, uh, artist to, uh, do drawings, paintings of Bible scenes so that when Ray talked about the Bible scene, they could cut to a visual of that Bible scene drawn by someone. And Ray was able to speak over the drawing so that it was accurate to what is believed would’ve been the look of the image in Bible times. And those images have, you know, moved on and they’re, you know, pretty much you don’t see them as much anymore. But I had an, a vision in my head of a few different Bible scenes, but one of them being, uh, David before he faces Goliath. And, uh, in my head there was this image that I remember seeing from one of Ray’s teachings where David is standing there with a sling and five smooth stones, and he’s in that valley. And he’s about to fight Goliath, but he hasn’t killed him yet. And Goliath is standing there, you know, however many feet from him with the armor bearer there with Goliath. And I call it kinda the moment before the moment. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: … where you’ve got this decision. Ken: That’s right. Kirk: Am I really gonna do this and put all my, my livelihood out there on the line, or am I gonna shrink back? Ken: Mm, right. Kirk: And, um, I wanted that, that picture, and so I reached out and I said, “You know, do you still have that?” And so you were able to get me the original- Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: … which is deeply meaningful to me. And so now, I now have that original painting over my, uh, fireplace in my office at home. And for me, it’s just a reminder of what it has been f- like for me and moving forward to walk with Jesus. Ken: Mm. Kirk: That I’ve gotta stand there looking at Goliath and say, “I’m doing this.” And even if I die, I die. Ken: Mm-hmm. Kirk: I’m gonna trust, uh, him and not trust my instincts, but trust his word. And so, I always say that, you know, once you make that decision standing there with Goliath’s right in front of you and you’re holding the stones and you make the decision to do it, then it’s easy from there. Ken: Mm. Kirk: But it’s in that moment, are you gonna retreat in fear, or are you gonna keep going forward in faith? Ken: Right. Kirk: And, um, that painting will always remind me of that. Ken: The moment before the moment, what a great way to end our time together. We so appreciate you, your faith, your stand. We pray for you as, um, as you play, for you and your family and what the Lord has ahead for you. Let’s, uh, let’s thank Kirk Cousins. Kirk: Thank you. John: Jim, that was a really fun and engaging conversation that, uh, our COO, Ken Windebank, had with Kirk Cousins at that live event.

Dave and Ashley Willis help husbands and wives rediscover God’s design for a “naked marriage” – where they can be emotionally, spiritually and physically vulnerable and transparent with each other. They share their own love story and describe how “love is not enough” to sustain a lifelong marriage; couples need to commit to serving and sacrificing for each other. They also talk about dealing with the past, balancing marriage and motherhood, financial struggles, and being faithful “in sickness and in health.” Communication is a gift from God to build solid relationships with each other. On this one-day Focus on the Family broadcast, Dr. Heather Holleman examines different components of conversation—from casual and emotional to sharing the way we think and believe.

                "title": "Derrick Henry - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Derrick Lamar Henry Jr.[1][2] (born January 4, 1994)[1] is an American professional football running back for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). Nicknamed \"King Henry\",[3][4] he is known for his imposing style of play and larger build than the average running back. Born and raised in Yulee, Florida, Henry set the national high school football record for career rushing yards with the Yulee Hornets. He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide, where during his junior season, he broke Herschel Walker's single-season college rushing yards record in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), won the 2015 Heisman Trophy, the Doak Walker Award, the Maxwell Award, and the Walter Camp Award, and was a key part of the 2015 Alabama Crimson Tide football team that won the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship. Henry was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the second round of the 2016 NFL draft, where he was a four-time Pro Bowl selection. A backup for most of his first two seasons in the league, Henry emerged as the Titans' feature back near the end of the 2018 season. He led the NFL in rushing yards for the 2019 season, as well as rushing touchdowns (tied with Green Bay Packers running back Aaron Jones). In 2020, Henry again led the league in rushing yards and touchdowns and became the eighth player in NFL history to rush for over 2,000 yards in a single season, and the second Tennessee Titan to do so, after Chris Johnson achieved it in 2009. Henry won the 2020 Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award. After missing more than half of the 2021 season to injury, he made his third and fourth Pro Bowl appearances in the subsequent two seasons. After eight seasons with Tennessee, Henry signed with the Ravens in 2024. Derrick Lamar Henry Jr. was born in Yulee, Florida, to Stacy Veal and Derrick Henry Sr., aged 15 and 16 respectively.[5] Henry's father was absent for much of his childhood, having been arrested 20 times for various crimes including drug and prostitution-related offenses, and was consequently in and out of prison and had trouble maintaining employment. His mother became a hemodialysis technician. Henry was raised primarily by his grandmother, Gladys, who nicknamed him \"Shocka\", as his birth shocked the whole family, given his parents' young ages. He developed a close relationship to his grandmother, whom he cites as very influential in his upbringing.[6][7] Henry attended Yulee High School, where he was a three-sport star in football, basketball, and track. He played as a running back for the Yulee Hornets football team.[8] He ran for 2,465 yards and 26 touchdowns as a freshman in 2009. He was named a first-team All-Coast selection at running back in 2010 after rushing for 2,788 yards and 38 touchdowns while averaging 8.9 yards per attempt. He rushed for 2,610 yards and 34 scores as a junior in 2011 to earn first-team All-Coast honors from the Florida Times-Union. He set the Florida high school record with a 510-yard performance against Jacksonville Jackson (a record he held until 2021[9]) and averaged 9.2 yards per carry and 327.8 yards per game as a senior, finishing the season with a state-record 4,261 yards and 55 touchdowns.[10] He finished his high school football career with 12,124 career rushing yards, which broke Ken Hall's career record.[11][12] During this time, Henry began receiving the nickname \"King Henry\" by stadium crowds and local television news reports as he began aiming to break the national high school rushing title.[13] He also rushed for 153 career touchdowns. His career touchdown totals rank fifth all-time. In four years at Yulee he averaged more than 250 yards a game and never rushed for fewer than 100 yards in a game.[14] He played for the East squad in the 2013 U.S. Army All-American Bowl, where he rushed for 53 yards with a touchdown and a two-point conversion.[15][16] As a track & field athlete, Henry competed as a sprinter at Yulee from 2010 to 2011. He posted a personal-best time of 11.11 seconds in the 100-meter dash at the 2011 FHSAA 2A District 3 Championships, where he placed seventh.[17] He was also a member of the 4×100 and 4×400 squads.[18] Considered a five-star recruit by ESPN.com, Henry was listed as the No. 1 athlete (player with no designated position) in the nation in 2013.[19] After originally committing to the University of Georgia, Henry committed to the University of Alabama on September 28, 2012.[20] He held offers from many of the top college football programs in the country, including USC, Notre Dame, Tennessee, Florida, and Clemson.[21] His number was eventually retired by Yulee.[22] Henry attended and played college football for the University of Alabama from 2013 to 2015 under head coach Nick Saban.[23][24] He majored in communication. He graduated on May 4, 2018.[25] That same day, he published an article in The Players' Tribune thanking his late grandmother for the inspiration to continue pursuing his degree.[25][26] As a true freshman in 2013, Henry rushed for 382 yards on 36 carries with three touchdowns in a backfield largely dominated by T. J. Yeldon and Kenyan Drake.[27][28] On October 19, against Arkansas, he had 111 rushing yards and his first collegiate rushing touchdown in the 52–0 victory.[29] During the 2014 Sugar Bowl, he rushed for 100 yards and a touchdown on eight carries and had a 61-yard touchdown reception in the 45–31 loss to the Oklahoma Sooners.[30][31] In that game, Spanish-language broadcaster Pablo Viruega on ESPN Deportes nicknamed him \"El Tractorcito\" (The Little Tractor) due to his long stride and powerful gait. The nickname became a popular internet meme.[32] In the 2014 season, Henry and Yeldon split a majority of the work in the backfield.[33] In the season opener against West Virginia, he had 113 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 33–23 victory in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game.[34] On September 20, against Florida, he had 111 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 42–21 victory.[35] On October 18 against Texas A&M, he had 70 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and a 41-yard receiving touchdown in the 59–0 victory.[36] On November 22, against Western Carolina, he had 92 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and a nine-yard receiving touchdown in the 48–14 victory.[37] In the annual rivalry game against Auburn, he had 72 rushing yards and a touchdown in the high-scoring 55–44 installment of the rivalry.[38] In the SEC Championship against Missouri, he had 141 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 42–13 victory.[39] Alabama qualified for the College Football Playoff and faced off against Ohio State in the National Semifinals in the Sugar Bowl.[40] Henry had 95 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and two receptions for 54 yards as Alabama fell 42–35 to the Buckeyes.[41] In his sophomore year, Henry rushed for 990 yards on 172 carries with 11 touchdowns.[42] After Yeldon left for the NFL, Henry took over as the starting running back as a junior in 2015. In the season opener against Wisconsin, he had 147 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in the 35–17 victory.[43] In the next game, against Middle Tennessee State, he had 96 rushing yards and another game with three rushing touchdowns in the 37–10 victory.[44] In the next game against Ole Miss, he had 127 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and five receptions for 39 yards in Alabama's only loss of the season, a 43–37 decision.[45] After rushing for 52 yards against Louisiana–Monroe, he had 148 rushing yards and a touchdown in a 38–10 victory over previously undefeated Georgia.[46][47] On October 10, he rushed for 95 yards and a touchdown against Arkansas in a 27–14 victory.[48] After the victory over the Razorbacks, he went on an impressive stretch of performances. On October 17, against Texas A&M, he had 236 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and an 18-yard reception in a 41–23 victory.[49] In the next game, a narrow 19–14 victory over Tennessee, he had 143 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.[50] In the following game, a much-anticipated matchup with fellow Heisman contender Leonard Fournette of LSU, he had 210 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in the 30–16 victory over the previously undefeated team.[51][52] In the next game, against Mississippi State, he had 204 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 31–6 victory.[53] In the next game, against Charleston Southern, he had 68 rushing yards and two more rushing touchdowns in a limited role in the 56–6 victory.[54] In the Iron Bowl against Auburn, he had 271 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown on 46 carries in the 29–13 victory.[55] In the SEC Championship against Florida, he had 44 carries for 189 yards and a touchdown in the 29–15 victory.[56] Alabama qualified for the College Football Playoff and faced off against Michigan State in the National Semifinals.[57] In the 38–0 victory over the Spartans in the Cotton Bowl, he had 75 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns.[58] During Alabama's 45–40 victory over Clemson in the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship, he rushed for 158 yards on 36 carries with three touchdowns.[59] During the game, he also broke Shaun Alexander's record for most career rushing yards in Alabama history.[60] Playing in all 15 games, he rushed for SEC records 2,219 yards and 28 touchdowns on 395 carries. In addition, he scored at least one touchdown in each game.[61][62][63] He led the NCAA in rushing attempts, rushing yards, rushing touchdowns, and points scored.[64] Henry won the Heisman Trophy, beating out finalists Christian McCaffrey and Deshaun Watson.[65] He won numerous other awards including the Doak Walker Award, Walter Camp Award, and Maxwell Award.[66] Henry declared for the 2016 NFL Draft after his junior season.[25] Coming out of Alabama, Henry was projected by the majority of analysts to be either drafted in the late first or second round. Scouts regarded his main assets to be his large frame, violent running, ability to break tackles with ease, speed, long strides, superior conditioning, and consistent play. The main concerns were about the wear and tear his body took as a workhorse at Alabama, his slow acceleration, average foot quickness, below-average catching ability, narrow based running style, sluggish cutbacks, and running tall.[67] Henry was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the second round (45th overall) of the 2016 NFL draft.[70] He was the second running back taken that year, after #4 Ezekiel Elliott.[71] He was reunited with his former fullback at Alabama Jalston Fowler.[72] On May 9, 2016, the Titans signed Henry to a four-year, $5.40 million contract with $3.30 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $2.13 million.[73] Henry began his rookie season as the backup running back to veteran DeMarco Murray. He wore the No. 2 jersey throughout training camp and preseason and donned the No. 22 once running back Dexter McCluster was cut on September 2, 2016.[74] Henry made his NFL debut and earned his first NFL start in the Titans' season-opening loss to the Minnesota Vikings. He finished the game with five carries for three yards and two receptions for 41 yards.[75] During Week 8, Henry scored his first NFL touchdown on a 6-yard rush in a 36–22 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He finished the game with 16 carries for a then career-high 60 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown and four catches for 37 yards.[76] On December 18, 2016, he had nine rushing attempts for 58 rushing yards and a season-high two rushing touchdowns in a 19–17 road victory over the Kansas City Chiefs.[77] During the season finale against the Houston Texans, he ran for a then-career-high 65 rushing yards on 15 carries and scored a touchdown in the 24–17 victory.[78] Henry finished his rookie season with 110 carries for 490 yards (both sixth among NFL rookies in 2016) and five touchdowns in 15 games and two starts.[79] He also caught 13 passes for 137 yards.[80] For most of the 2017 season, Henry split carries with DeMarco Murray and run-oriented quarterback Marcus Mariota. During Week 2, Henry ran for 92 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries in a 37–16 road victory against the Jaguars.[81] On October 16, 2017, on Monday Night Football, Henry ran for a then career-best 131 yards on 19 carries, including a 72-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter of the 36–22 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. In addition, he had a 14-yard reception in the victory.[82] During Week 13, Henry ran for 109 yards on 11 carries and beat his longest rush of the year with a 75-yard rushing touchdown late in the fourth quarter of the 24–13 victory over the Texans.[83] In the regular season finale against the Jaguars, Henry caught his first receiving touchdown on a 66-yard reception from Marcus Mariota in the 15–10 victory.[84] The Titans finished second in the AFC South with a 9–7 record and made the playoffs as a Wild Card team.[85][86] In the Wild Card Round, the Titans played the Chiefs. Because DeMarco Murray was out with a knee injury, Henry got the start.[87] In a 22–21 road victory, Henry had the best performance of his career up to that point, rushing for 156 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries and catching two passes for 35 yards.[88] His 191 yards-from-scrimmage was a franchise record. In the Divisional Round against the New England Patriots, Henry had 28 rushing yards and 21 receiving yards in the 35–14 road loss.[89] Henry finished the regular season with 176 carries for 744 rushing yards and five touchdowns in 15 games and two starts. He also caught 11 passes for 136 yards and a touchdown. In the postseason, Henry ran for 184 yards and a touchdown on 35 carries and caught five passes for 56 yards.[90] During the 2018 offseason, Matt LaFleur was hired as the Titans' new offensive coordinator and the team also acquired running back Dion Lewis.[91] Lewis's pass-catching ability was seen as a fit for LaFleur's offensive scheme, which often employed running backs to catch passes out of the backfield, and leading to success with Todd Gurley in the previous season as offensive coordinator with the Rams.[92] This led to speculation that LaFleur would favor Lewis over Henry.[93] Henry ended up splitting carries with Lewis and run-oriented quarterback Marcus Mariota for most of the 2018 season. During Week 2, Henry recorded an eight-yard pass completion, the first of his career, to wide receiver Taywan Taylor in the Titans' 20–17 victory over the Texans.[94] He also had 18 carries in that game and the next against the Jaguars, but was used much less frequently through the middle of the season. From Weeks 4–13, Henry averaged nine carries for only 37 yards per game, and never rushed for over 60 yards.[80] This all changed in Week 14 against the Jaguars. In the second quarter, Henry had a 99-yard touchdown run, fending off three tacklers, tying him with Tony Dorsett for the longest NFL touchdown run. He finished the game with four rushing touchdowns and 238 rushing yards on 17 carries, breaking Chris Johnson's franchise record of 228 yards in 2009.[95][96][97] He also became the ninth player in NFL history to record a 200+ yard and 4+ touchdown game, and the first to do so on fewer than 22 carries.[98] His 238 rushing yards were the most by any player for a single game for the 2018 season.[99] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week due to his spectacular performance.[100] During Week 15, the Titans went on the road to face the New York Giants. In a cold and rainy game, Henry led the NFL in rushing for the second consecutive week with 170 yards and two touchdowns on a career-high 33 carries, along with a one-yard reception and six-yard pass completion in the 17–0 shutout.[101] In Weeks 16 and 17, he combined for 177 rushing yards and a touchdown in the two games against the Washington Redskins and Colts.[102][103] He was later named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[104] Henry finished the 2018 season with 1,059 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns along with 15 receptions for 99 yards.[105] After the season, he was ranked 99th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[106] In the 2019 season opener against the Cleveland Browns, Henry rushed 19 times for 84 yards and a touchdown. He also caught one pass for a 75-yard touchdown as the Titans won on the road 43–13.[107] During Week 2 against the Colts, he rushed 15 times for 81 yards and a touchdown as the Titans narrowly lost 19–17.[108] Two weeks later against the Atlanta Falcons, Henry had his first 100-yard game of the season when he rushed for 100 yards on 27 carries in a 24–10 road victory.[109] In the next game against the Buffalo Bills, he rushed for 78 yards and a touchdown as the Titans lost by a score of 14–7.[110] After a season-low 28 yards in a Week 6 shutout loss to the Denver Broncos, Henry sank to 12th in the league in rushing, over 200 yards behind the league leaders he would eventually catch.[111] Henry responded with 90 rushing yards and a touchdown in a 23–20 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 7.[112] During Week 9 against the Carolina Panthers, Henry rushed 13 times for 63 yards and a touchdown and caught three passes for 36 yards and a touchdown in the 30–20 road loss.[113] In the next game against the Chiefs, he finished with 188 rushing yards and two touchdowns as the Titans narrowly won 35–32.[114] Henry won the FedEx Ground Player of the Week for his efforts.[115] During a Jaguars rematch in Week 12 after a Week 11 bye, Henry had a 74-yard rushing touchdown in the third quarter. Overall, he finished the 42–20 victory with 159 rushing yards and two touchdowns along with one reception for 16 yards.[116] In the next game, a rematch against the Colts, he rushed 26 times for 149 yards and a touchdown in the 31–17 road victory.[117] During Week 14 against the Oakland Raiders, Henry ran for 103 yards and two touchdowns in the 42–21 road victory.[118] During the regular-season finale against the Texans, Henry finished with 211 rushing yards and three touchdowns as the Titans won 35–14 and made it to the playoffs as a Wild Card team. During the game, Henry narrowly won the 2019 rushing title over Nick Chubb of the Cleveland Browns, with the winning rush being a 53-yard touchdown run.[119] This was Henry's first career rushing crown and the first Titan to win it since Chris Johnson in 2009.[120] Henry finished the regular season setting career-highs in carries with 303, rushing yards with 1,540, and rushing touchdowns with 16, which all led the league, despite only playing in 15 games, missing the Week 16 game against the New Orleans Saints due to a hamstring injury.[121] He also set career-highs in receptions with 16, receiving yards with 206, and receiving touchdowns with two.[122] On December 17, 2019, he was selected to his first Pro Bowl.[123] On January 3, 2020, he was named to the second-team All-Pro at both the running back and flex position, both behind Christian McCaffrey.[124] He was ranked 10th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[125] With the Titans finishing the season 9–7, the team narrowly clinched a wild card spot for the #6 seed. In the Wild Card Round against the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots, which was played on his 26th birthday, Henry rushed for over 100 yards and a touchdown in the first half, finishing with 182 yards (the most ever against a Bill Belichick-led team, and the third most ever in a postseason road game) and a 22-yard reception in the 20–13 road victory. Henry became the first rushing champion with a 100-yard playoff game since Terrell Davis in 1998, the first to win a playoff game since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2007, and the second Titan with multiple post-season 100+ rushing games.[126] He also broke his own franchise record for most yards-from-scrimmage with 204.[127] During the Divisional Round against the Baltimore Ravens, Henry rushed 30 times for 195 yards and threw a three-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Corey Davis in the 28–12 road victory.[128] He became the second player in NFL history with three postseason games with at least 150 rushing yards, joining Terrell Davis, who had four. In addition, he became the only player with at least 175 rushing yards in consecutive games. Davis is the only other with two such games in a career.[129] In the AFC Championship against the Chiefs, Henry was mostly held in check. During the game, he rushed 19 times for 69 yards and a touchdown in the 35–24 road loss.[130] On March 16, 2020, the Titans placed the franchise tag on Henry.[131] He signed the tag on April 2, 2020.[132] Henry signed a new four-year $50 million contract with the team on July 15, 2020.[133] Despite leading the league in rushing yards for most of the first four weeks of the 2020 season, Henry was limited to no more than 3.7 yards per carry for all but one of them. These struggles ended in the week 6 game against the Texans, Henry finished with 212 rushing yards, 52 receiving yards, and two touchdowns (including a 94-yard rushing touchdown). In overtime, he finished the game with a five-yard touchdown to end the game as the Titans won 42–36.[134] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance in Week 6.[135] He was also named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October after racking up 399 scrimmage yards with 344 yards rushing and five touchdowns.[136] During a Week 8 31–20 road loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, he ran for 112 yards and a touchdown.[137] In Week 11 against the Ravens, Henry had 133 rushing yards and the game-winning touchdown in overtime to defeat the Ravens on the road 30–24.[138][139] In a 45–26 road victory against the Colts in Week 12, Henry had 27 carries for 178 rushing yards and three touchdowns.[140] In Week 14 against the Jaguars, Henry rushed 26 times for 215 yards and two touchdowns during the 31–10 victory.[141] In Week 15 against the Detroit Lions, Henry rushed for 147 yards and a touchdown during the 46–25 win.[142] In Week 17 against the Houston Texans, Henry rushed for a career-high 250 rushing yards and two touchdowns during the 41–38 road victory.[143] Henry was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[144] During the game, Henry became the eighth running back in NFL history to surpass 2,000 rushing yards.[145] This also made him the only player to have 2,000 yard rushing seasons in high school, college, and the NFL.[146] In addition to his 2,027 rushing yards, Henry established career highs in carries (378), yards-per-carry (5.4) and rushing touchdowns (17). He was named the 2020 Offensive Player of the Year at the 10th Annual NFL Honors.[147] He was ranked fourth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[148] In the Wild Card Round of the playoffs against the Ravens, Henry was held without a single first down. He was limited to 40 yards on 18 carries (2.2 yards-per-carry) and three receptions for 11 yards during the 20–13 loss.[149] Henry began the season slow, held to only 58 rushing yards as the Titans lost to the Arizona Cardinals 38–13.[150] During Week 2 against the Seattle Seahawks, Henry finished with 182 rushing yards, 55 receiving yards, and three rushing touchdowns as the Titans won 33–30 in overtime. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for Week 2.[151] In Week 6, Henry ran for 143 yards and three touchdowns in a 34–31 win over the Bills, earning his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor of the year.[152] During a Week 8 win against the Colts, Henry suffered a Jones fracture that would end up sidelining him for the remainder of the regular season.[153] He was placed on injured reserve on November 1. Prior to his injury, Henry was leading the league in carries, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns, and was on pace to break the NFL rushing record.[154] Henry was named the Titans' nominee for the 2021 Walter Payton Man of the Year Award.[155] Henry was activated off injured reserve on January 21, 2022, for the team's Divisional Round game against the Bengals.[156] In his return, Henry had 20 carries for 62 yards along with a rushing touchdown in the Titans' 19–16 loss.[157] He was ranked 12th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[158] Prior to the 2022 season on September 1, 2022, Henry was given a raise by the Titans, receiving a $2 million bump for the year.[159] In Week 3, against the Las Vegas Raiders, Henry had 143 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown in the 24–22 victory.[160] In the following game, against the Colts, Henry had 22 carries for 114 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 24–17 victory.[161] One week later, he had 28 carries for 102 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in a 21–17 victory over the Washington Commanders.[162] In Week 7, Henry had 30 carries for 128 rushing yards in a 19–10 victory over the Colts.[163] In Week 8, Henry had 32 carries for 219 yards and two touchdowns in a 17–10 win over the Texans, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[164] He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October.[165] In Week 9, against the Chiefs, Henry had 17 carries for 115 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 20–17 overtime loss.[166] In Week 11, against the Green Bay Packers, Henry had 132 scrimmage yards and one rushing touchdown. In addition, he threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Austin Hooper in the 27–17 victory.[167] In Week 14, against the Jaguars, he had 155 scrimmage yards in the 36–22 loss.[168] In the following week against the Chargers, Henry had 163 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown in the 17–14 loss.[169] In Week 16, Henry had 23 carries for 126 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 19–14 loss to the Houston Texans.[170] With Week 17 having no bearing on the Titans' playoff hopes, Henry was rested for the Dallas Cowboys game.[171] In the Week 18 winner-take-all game for the AFC South, Henry had 30 carries for 109 rushing yards in the 20–16 elimination loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.[172][173] In the 2022 season, Henry finished with 349 carries for 1,538 rushing yards and 13 rushing touchdowns to go along with 33 receptions for 398 receiving yards.[174] He led the league in rushing attempts and finished second in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns.[175] He was named to the Pro Bowl.[176] Henry was ranked 25th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[177] In Week 1, a loss to the Saints, Henry had 119 scrimmage yards.[178] In a Week 4 victory over the Bengals, he had 22 carries for 122 rushing yards and a touchdown.[179] In Weeks 12–14, Henry had two rushing touchdowns in three consecutive games.[180][181][182] In Week 15 against the Texans, Henry had a poor performance, becoming the first player in NFL history to have at least 20 touches and generate less than 15 yards from scrimmage.[183] In Week 16, he had a rushing and passing touchdown.[184] In the 2023 season, Henry finished with 280 carries for 1,167 rushing yards, the most in the AFC, and 12 rushing touchdowns. He also had 28 receptions for 214 receiving yards.[185] On March 12, 2024, Henry signed with the Baltimore Ravens on a two-year, $16 million deal worth up to $20 million which also included $9 million fully guaranteed in the first year.[186] In Week 3, Henry had 151 rushing yards on 25 attempts and two touchdowns in a 28–25 win against the Cowboys.[187] In Week 4 against the Bills, Henry had 199 rushing yards and a touchdown on 24 carries with an 87-yard rushing score on the Ravens’ first offensive play, which was the longest run in franchise history. He also had 10 receiving yards and a touchdown on three receptions. The Ravens won 35–10.[188] For his performance in Week 4, Henry was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[189] In Week 5 against the Bengals, Henry scored his 100th overall career touchdown, while also reaching the mark of 10,000 career rushing yards later in the game, becoming the fifth player in NFL history to achieve the feat. The Ravens won in overtime, 41–38.[190] In Week 6, Henry rushed for 132 yards and two touchdowns in a 30-23 win over the Washington Commanders, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[191] Standing at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighing 247 pounds (112 kg), Henry is much larger than most running backs and has a frame comparable to that of a linebacker.[192] Henry is a \"power back\", using his large size and strength to overpower defenders, stiff arm and break tackles. In 2020, he accumulated 1,073 yards after contact, over 300 yards more than any running back in the league, and led the league in broken tackles with 34.[193] He couples that strength and size with surprising speed relative to his size.[194] Henry is adept at using the stiff-arm to repel defenders, with it being described as his \"signature\".[195][196] As a power back, his playing style contrasts with those of smaller, so-called \"scat backs\", who have greater elusiveness due to their faster ability to change directions. Henry is not usually used as a pass catcher, but he makes up for his lack of productiveness as a pass-catcher using his dominance as a pure runner.[193] Observers have also noted that Henry has a tendency to get better, particularly in yards per carry, in the later stages of a game, as his strength and toughness wears down opponents.[197] Henry's successful running game has also permitted the offense success with play-action.[198] In 2018, Henry fulfilled a promise to his grandmother by graduating from Alabama with a bachelor's degree in communications.[209] In November 2019, Henry's hometown of Yulee, Florida, celebrated him with a welcome sign in his honor. Fundraising for the sign came from local residents and businesses.[210] Henry has been in a relationship with Adrianna Rivas since 2016. They have two daughters.[211][212] Italics denotes active player",

                "content": "Futbol Club Barcelona (Catalan pronunciation: [fubˈbɔl ˈklub bəɾsəˈlonə] ⓘ), commonly known as FC Barcelona and colloquially as Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football. Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto \"Més que un club\" (\"More than a club\").[2] Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable football club in the world, worth $5.6 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €800.1 million.[3][4] The official Barcelona anthem is the \"Cant del Barça\", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[5] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana. Barcelona are one of the the world's most decorated clubs. Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 77 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 14 Supercopa de España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won 22 European and worldwide titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, five UEFA Super Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups.[6][7][8] Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2015, and occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May 2023[update].[9][10][11] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico. Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media following in the world among sports teams.[12][13] Barcelona players have won a joint record twelve Ballon d'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record six FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners including Romário, Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy—Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi—were chosen as the three best players in the world in the Ballon d'Or ranking, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy.[14][15] Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards.[16] Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid.[17][18] In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first European football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.[19] In 2011, the club became European champions again, winning five trophies.[20] This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time.[21][22][23] By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.[24] On 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended – Walter Wild (the first president of the club), Luis de Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.[26][27] FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1901, the club participated in the first football competition played on the Iberian Peninsula, the Copa Macaya, narrowly losing to Hispania AC, but in the following year, Barça won the tournament, the club's first-ever piece of silverware,[28] and then participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya (a combination of players from Athletic Club and Bilbao FC) in the final.[29] In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president in a desperate attempt to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, \"Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on.\"[30] Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.[31] On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears – with some minor changes – as of the present day.[32] The stadium is regarded as the main element that helped the club grow in the 1910s and become a dominant team,[33] winning three successive Campionats de Catalunya between 1909 and 1911, three Copa del del Rey in four years between 1910 and 1913, and four successive Pyrenees Cup between the inaugural year in 1910 and 1913, which was one of the earliest international club cups in Europe since it consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia; all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era.[34] Notable figures of Barça's first great team include Carles Comamala, Alfredo Massana, Amechazurra, Paco Bru, and Jack Greenwell.[35] The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917.[36] During the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity.[37] On 4 February 1917, the club held its first tribute match to honour Ramón Torralba, who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa where Barcelona won the match 6–2.[38] Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year.[39] Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.[40] In 1912, Gamper recruited Paulino Alcántara, the club's seventh all-time top-scorer, and in 1917, Gamper also recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After this hiring, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field and soon enjoyed its first \"golden age\". Along with Alcántara, the Barça team under Greenwell also included Sagibarba, Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier, Félix Sesúmaga, and Franz Platko.[41] This team won 9 out of 10 Campionats de Catalunya between 1919 and 1928 and two Copa del Rey titles in 1920 and 1922. In total, during the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups.[42][31] On 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club.[43] This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club.[39] On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara, against the Spanish national team. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane.[44] In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled \"Oda a Platko\", which was written by a member of the Generation of '27, Rafael Alberti, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper, Franz Platko.[45] On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.[31] Although they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escolà, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters.[46] Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936, and 1938,[42] success at a national level (with the exception of the 1937 disputed title) evaded them. A month after the entire Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao.[47] On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party.[48] He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity.[49] In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.[50][51] On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club's offices.[52][53] A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the \"undisciplined\" Catalanism, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to Club de Fútbol Barcelona and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.[54] In 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del Generalísimo (now the Copa del Rey). The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3–0. Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg, beating Barcelona 11–1.[55] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[56] It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelona's players were threatened by police in the changing room, though nothing was ever proven.[57] Despite the difficult political situation, CF Barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with Josep Samitier as coach and players like César, Ramallets and Velasco, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949.[58] In 1949, they also won the first Copa Latina.[59] In June 1950, Barcelona signed László Kubala, who was to be an important figure at the club.[60] On a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: at the same time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.[61][62] Coach Ferdinand Daučík and László Kubala led the team to five different trophies including La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa Latina, the Copa Eva Duarte, and the Copa Martini & Rossi in 1952. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo again.[40] With Helenio Herrera as coach, a young Luis Suárez, the European Footballer of the Year in 1960, and two influential Hungarians recommended by Kubala, Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor, the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off. However, they lost 2–3 to Benfica in the final.[63][64] The 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players.[64] The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu in front of dictator Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.[65][66] The 1973–74 season saw the arrival of Johan Cruyff, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[67] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[68] Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi, Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil, he helped the club win the 1973–74 season for the first time since 1960,[42] defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu en route. He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.[69] In 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.[72][73] On 16 May 1979, the club won its first European Cup Winners' Cup by beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 4–3 in Basel in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling blaugrana fans. The same year, Núñez began to invest in the club's youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona.[74] In June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from Boca Juniors.[75] In the following season, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with Barcelona, however, was short-lived and he soon left for Napoli. At the start of the 1984–85 season, Terry Venables was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster. The next season, he took the team to their second European Cup final, only to lose on penalties to Steaua București during a dramatic evening in Seville.[72] Around this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency.[76] Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.[77] After the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Barcelona signed the English top scorer Gary Lineker, along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory in the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad.[72] In 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club, this time as manager and he assembled what would later be dubbed the \"Dream Team\".[78] He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero, Jon Andoni Goikoetxea, Miguel Angel Nadal, and Txiki Begiristain while signing international players such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romário, and Hristo Stoichkov.[79] It was ten years after the inception of the youth programme, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. Pep Guardiola, the future coach of Barcelona, was one of the first graduates and would go on to receive international recognition.[80] Under Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies.[81] With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years.[82] Cruyff's fortune was to change, and, in his final two seasons, he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president Josep Lluís Núñez, resulting in his departure.[72] Reacting to Cruyff's departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall.[83] The objective of the group, called L'Elefant Blau, was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values.[83][84] Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.[85] Cruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97. He recruited Ronaldo for a world record transfer fee from his previous club, PSV and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the Supercopa de España, with Ronaldo registering 47 goals in 49 games.[86] Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available.[87] Like Maradona, Ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for Inter Milan in another world record transfer.[86] However, new heroes emerged, such as Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Luis Enrique and Rivaldo, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its centenari, winning the Primera División title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.[87] The departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.[90] The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season. Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from Rivaldo, who completed arguably the greatest hat-trick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification.[91][92][93] Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.[94] After the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former Dutch and AC Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o, Rafael Márquez and Edgar Davids, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Víctor Valdés, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.[95] In the 2005–06 season, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernabéu, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation.[96] In the Champions League, Barcelona beat English club Arsenal in the final. Trailing 1–0 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2–1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti, for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years.[97] Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star Lionel Messi. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho.[98] Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form.[99] In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against Getafe 5–2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's goal of the century, but then lost the second leg 4–0. They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional.[100] In the Champions League, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals.[101] Barcelona finished the 2007–08 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League and Copa del Rey, both times losing to the eventual champions, Manchester United and Valencia, respectively. The day after a 4–1 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Frank Rijkaard's duties on 30 June 2008.[102] Barcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season.[102] Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi.[104] Barça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey final, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time.[105] A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 2008–09 La Liga champions.[106] Barça finished the season by beating Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with goals from Eto'o and Messi, to win their third Champions League title, and complete the first ever treble won by a Spanish team.[107][108][109] The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao[110] and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk,[111] becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup.[112] Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de España for a ninth time.[113][114] After Laporta's departure from the club in June 2010, Sandro Rosell was soon elected as the new president. The elections were held on 13 June, where he received 61.35% (57,088 votes, a record) of total votes.[115] Rosell signed David Villa from Valencia for €40 million[116] and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool for €19 million.[117] At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Barcelona players that had graduated from the club's La Masia youth system would play a major role in Spain becoming world champions. On 11 July, seven players who came through the academy participated in the final, six of whom were Barcelona players who started the match, with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands.[118] In November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival Real Madrid 5–0 in El Clásico.[119] At the ceremony for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or in December, Barcelona's La Masia became the first youth academy ever to have all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or, with Messi, Iniesta and Xavi being named the three best players in the world for 2010.[120] In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy, their third title in succession, finishing with 96 points.[121] In April 2011, the club reached the Copa del Rey final, losing 1–0 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia.[122] In May, Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League Final 3–1 held at Wembley Stadium, a repeat of the 2009 final, winning their fourth European Cup.[123] In August 2011, La Masia graduate Cesc Fàbregas was bought from Arsenal and he would help Barcelona defend the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid. The Supercup victory brought the total number of official trophies to 73, matching the number of titles won by Real Madrid.[124] Later the same month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup defeating Porto 2–0 with goals from Messi and Fàbregas. This extended the club's overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid's total amount of official trophies.[125] The Super Cup victory also saw Guardiola win his 12th trophy out of a possible 15 in his three years at the helm of the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.[126] In December, Barcelona won the Club World Cup for a record second time since its establishment, after defeating 2011 Copa Libertadores holders Santos 4–0 in the final thanks to two goals from Messi and goals from Xavi and Fàbregas.[127] As a result, the overall trophy haul during the reign of Guardiola was further extended and saw Barcelona win their 13th trophy out of a possible 16.[128][129] Considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time, with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson stating, ”They mesmerise you with their passing”,[22] their five trophies in 2011 saw them receive the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year.[130] In the 2011–12 season, Barcelona lost the semi-finals of the Champions League against Chelsea. Guardiola, who had been on a rolling contract and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections,[131][132] announced that he would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant Tito Vilanova.[133][134] Guardiola finished his tenure with Barça winning the Copa del Rey final 3–0, bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Barça had won under his coaching.[135] It was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager.[136] Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them at the beginning of March.[137] They reached the semi-final stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it was announced that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.[138] On 22 July 2013, Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013–14 season.[139] Barcelona won the 2013 Supercopa de España 1–1 on away goals.[140] On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of a complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar.[141] Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term.[142] Barcelona won the treble in the 2014–15 season, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice.[143] On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atlético Madrid.[144] This was Barcelona's seventh La Liga title in the last ten years.[145] On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou.[146] On 6 June, Barcelona won the 2015 Champions League Final with a 3–1 win against Juventus, which completed the treble, the club's second in six years.[147] Barcelona's attacking trio of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", scored 122 goals in all competitions, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.[148] On 11 August, Barcelona started the 2015–16 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla 5–4 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup. They ended the year with a 3–0 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 Club World Cup final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time, with Suárez, Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament.[149] The Club World Cup was Barcelona's 20th international title, a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly.[150][151] By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions, Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, breaking Real Madrid's record of 178 goals scored in 2014.[152] On 10 February 2016, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enrique's Barcelona broke the club's record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola's team in the 2010–11 season, with a 1–1 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 2015–16 Copa del Rey.[153][154] With a 5–1 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March, Barcelona's 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrid's Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988–1989 season.[155][156] After Barça reached 39 matches unbeaten, their run ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2–1 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou.[157] On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons.[158] The front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals, breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season.[159] On 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League Round of 16 second Leg, defeating Paris Saint-Germain 6–1 (aggregate score 6–5), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4–0.[160] On 29 May 2017, former player Ernesto Valverde was named as Luis Enrique's successor.[161] On 20 September 2017, Barcelona issued a statement exercising their stance on the 2017 Catalan referendum saying, \"FC Barcelona, in holding the utmost respect for its diverse body of members, will continue to support the will of the majority of Catalan people, and will do so in a civil, peaceful, and exemplary way\".[162] The match against UD Las Palmas on the referendum day was requested to be postponed by the Barcelona board due to heavy violence in Catalonia, but it (the request) was declined by La Liga, therefore being held behind closed doors.[163] Two directors, Jordi Monés and Carles Vilarrubí, handed in their resignations in protest at the game's being played.[164] Winning La Liga for the 2017–18 season, on 9 May 2018, Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5–1 to set the longest unbeaten streak (43 games) in La Liga history.[165] On 27 April 2019, Barcelona won their 26th La Liga title.[166] However, the La Liga title was overshadowed by an improbable Champions League exit to Liverpool in the semi-finals, with Barça losing the second leg 0–4 after being up 3–0 after a home victory.[167] On 13 January 2020, following the loss to Atlético Madrid in the Spanish Supercup, former Real Betis coach Quique Setién replaced Ernesto Valverde as the new head coach of Barcelona.[168] Ultimately Barcelona finished the season trophyless for first time in 12 years. On 17 August, the club confirmed that Setién had been removed from his position as manager with director of football Eric Abidal also dismissed from his position.[169] Two days later, Ronald Koeman was appointed as the new head coach of Barcelona.[170] Rising dissatisfaction among supporters due to worsening finances and decline on the pitch in the previous season led to Josep Maria Bartomeu announcing his resignation as president on 27 October 2020, to avoid facing a vote of no confidence from the club members.[171][172] On 7 March 2021, Joan Laporta was elected president of Barcelona with 54.28% of the vote.[173] Barcelona won their 31st Copa del Rey, their only trophy under Ronald Koeman, after defeating Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the final.[174] In August 2021 Barcelona found themselves unable to comply with La Liga's Financial Fair Play requirements, and revealed a club debt of €1.35bn and a wage bill accounting for 103% of total income. Negotiations with Lionel Messi, now in the final year of his contract, had been ongoing for some time. However, on 5 August 2021, Barcelona announced that they would be unable to re-sign Messi to an extension due to La Liga regulations. This was despite the fact that the club and Messi had reached an agreement over the details of a new contract. Messi departed the club after 21 years as a Barça player, and the club's all-time leading goalscorer, and signed on a free transfer with French club Paris Saint-Germain.[175][176] The financial implications also restricted Barcelona in the transfer market and as a result most of the incoming players were either free transfers or loans and they had to reduce players' wages to register the incoming players.[177] Poor performances in La Liga and the Champions League led to the sacking of Ronald Koeman on 28 October, with a club legend Xavi replacing him.[178][179] Xavi could not reverse the fortunes in the Champions League, and Barcelona dropped down to the Europa League for the first time since 2003–04, subsequently exiting in the quarter-finals.[180] In the domestic league, Xavi improved Barça's form and guided them from ninth to second, guaranteeing a Champions League spot next season. However, this also meant Barcelona finished trophyless after earlier Supercopa and Copa del Rey exits.[181] On 15 January 2023, Xavi guided Barcelona to their first trophy since the 2021 Copa del Rey, as the Catalans defeated Real Madrid 3–1 in the Supercopa de España final.[182] The nickname culer for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan cul (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their culs over the stand.[183][184] In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population.[185] Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club.[186] The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009,[187] the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media.[188][189] As of 31 May 2023[update], the club has 150,317 memberships, called socis.[190] In addition to membership, as of March 2022[update] there are 1,264 officially registered fan clubs, called penyes, around the world.[191] The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona.[192] Among the best supported teams globally, Barcelona has the second highest social media following in the world among sports teams, with over 103 million Facebook fans as of December 2021[update], only behind Real Madrid with 111 million.[12][193] The club has had many prominent people among its supporters, including Pope John Paul II, who was an honorary member, and former prime minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.[194][195] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[196] Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[197] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[198][199] In 1936, when Francisco Franco started the Coup d'état against the democratic Second Spanish Republic, the president of Barcelona, Josep Sunyol, member of the Republican Left of Catalonia and Deputy to The Cortes, was arrested and executed without trial by Franco's troops[200] (Sunyol was exercising his political activities, visiting Republican troops north of Madrid).[198] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to the fascist-like regime. In this period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[201] There's an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree than Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its royal name after the fall of the Republic). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed CF Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\" rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid weren't particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top not only of Spanish but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[202] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had.\" Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, 6 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 1 Copa Eva Duarte, 6 European Cups, 2 Latin Cups, and 1 Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won 8 league titles, 9 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 3 Copa Eva Duarte titles, 3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and 2 Latin Cups.[203][204] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[205] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[206] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people.[207] An intense fixture which is marked by its indiscipline in addition to memorable goal celebrations from both teams – often involving mocking the opposition – such notable celebrations occurred in 2009 when Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of incensed Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and in 2017 when Lionel Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[208] Barça's local rival has always been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners.[209] The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid.[210] Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.[211][212] Traditionally, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Barça's revolutionary spirit.[213] Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.[214] In 1918, Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue.[209] Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the derbi has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.[209] Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the primera división league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Barça on three occasions from 87 seasons (1928–2022) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951, while Barcelona's biggest win was 5–0 on seven occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975, 1992, 2016 and 2017). Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against Barça during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.[215] One of Barcelona's rivals in European football is Italian club AC Milan.[216][217][218][219] The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the third most played match in European club competitions, behind Real Madrid–Juventus (21) and Real Madrid–Bayern Munich (26).[220][221][222] Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Barça's five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups.[223] Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football, with 19 and 14 titles respectively, both behind Real Madrid's 23.[224] Barcelona leads the head-to-head record with eight wins and five defeats. The first encounter between the two clubs was in the 1959–60 European Cup. They faced off in the round of 16 and Barça won the tie on a 7–1 aggregate score (0–2 in Milan and 5–1 in Barcelona).[225] While Milan had never knocked Barcelona out of the European Cup, they beat Johan Cruyff's Dream Team 4–0 in the 1994 Champions League final, despite being the underdogs.[226][227] In 2013, however, Barcelona made a \"historic\" comeback from a 0–2 first leg defeat in the round of 16 of the 2012–13 Champions League, winning 4–0 at Camp Nou.[228][229] Along with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and Osasuna, Barcelona is organised as a registered association.[230][231] Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership.[232] The members of Barcelona, called socis, form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[233] As of 31 May 2023[update], the club has 150,317 socis.[190] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Barcelona's worth to be around €752 million (US$1 billion), ranking them fourth after Manchester United, Real Madrid and Arsenal, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[234][235] According to Deloitte, Barcelona had a recorded revenue of €366 million in the same period, ranking second to Real Madrid, who generated €401 million in revenue.[236] In 2013, Forbes magazine ranked Barcelona the third most valuable sports team in the world, behind Real Madrid and Manchester United, with a value of $2.6 billion.[237] In 2014, Forbes ranked them the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.2 billion, and Deloitte ranked them the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €484.6 million.[238][239] In 2017, Forbes ranked them the fourth most valuable sports team in the world with a team value of $3.64 billion.[240] In 2018, Barcelona became the first sports team to surpass $1bn in annual revenues.[241] In November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of £10m ($13.8m) per year.[242][243] However, years of profligate spending under the leadership of Josep Maria Bartomeu (president between 2014 and 2020) and other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, saw the club's gross debt rise to about $1.4 billion in 2021, much of it short-term.[241] On November 9, 2024, Barcelona announced its new sponsership deal with Nike. It is said that it is the highest deal in football history.[244] Since its origins, Barcelona has had a close relationship with the world of culture, especially, with Catalan culture.[245][246][247] The club's statutes from 1932 already said that Barça \"is an association of a cultural and sporting nature\".[248] The club and its players have been a source of inspiration for writers, musicians, visual artists, journalists, cartoonists, theater, and film people.[249][250] In literature, some great Catalan writers they were inspired by the club. In 1957, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Camp Nou, Josep Maria de Sagarra dedicated a poem titled Blau i grana.[251] Poet Manuel Vázquez Montalbán wrote regularly about his vision of the team. Some expressions emerged that caught on in the popular imagination, such as identifying Barça with \"The unarmed army of Catalonia.\" He also wrote that \"Barça is the only legal institution that unites the man on the street with the Catalonia that could have been and was not.\"[252][253] The great anniversaries have been favorable occasions for the club to involve great Catalan figures from the cultural world in its activities. Names such as Josep Segrelles, Joan Miró and Antoni Tàpies have signed commemorative posters, just as Jaume Picas and the writer Josep Maria Espinàs, on the occasion of the club's 75th anniversary, wrote the lyrics for Cant del Barça, the current anthem, with music by Manuel Valls.[254][255] The Blaugrana world has also been a source of inspiration in the plastic arts, with names such as Jordi Alumà, Josep Maria Subirachs, Antoni Tàpies or Josep Viladomat, who made the 'Avi del Barça' sculpture in the La Masia.[256] Salvador Dalí paid tribute to the club's 75th anniversary with an etching.[257] In performing arts, music has also been present, from the tango that Gardel dedicated to Samitier to the songs of Joan Manuel Serrat, La Trinca and many others. Theater has also been a good way to express the feelings of Barça fans, from the El Paralelo cuplés from before the Civil War or skits like 'El Partido del Domingo', by Castaños, to more recent texts, like El culékulé, by Xavier Bosch.[258] In times of political difficulty or lack of freedoms, Barça has been a refuge and means of expression for cultural and artistic activities. In 2013, the club highlighted the 'Barça Cultura' plan, an initiative that promotes the area of institutional relations and protocol with the aim of offering Barcelona as a platform to promote culture in Catalonia.[259] In 2022, Barcelona and Òmnium sign an agreement to promote the Catalan language, culture and the country.[260] There are many documentaries and films that have been created throughout history to capture the successes and journey of the club over the years. More recently, in December 2022, Amazon Prime Video released a five-episode docuseries called FC Barcelona: A New Era.[261] It documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their 2021–22 season. In September 2023, Amazon Prime Video launched the second season with a five-episode docuseries. It focuses on their 2022-23 behind the scenes season.[262] In March 2021, Lionel Messi overtook Xavi's record of 767 games played for the club, and presently has made 778 official appearances in all competitions, while also holding the record for the most appearances in La Liga matches for Barcelona, with 520.[263] Barcelona's all-time highest goalscorer in official competitions is Lionel Messi with 672 goals, surpassing César Rodríguez's 232 goals in March 2012, a record which stood for 60 years.[264] In December 2020, Messi also overtook Pelé's 643 goals for Santos to become the highest official scorer for a single club.[265] Messi is the record goalscorer for Barcelona in European and international club competitions,[266] and the record league scorer with 474 goals in La Liga.[267] Four other players have managed to score over 100 league goals for Barcelona: César Rodríguez (190), Luis Suárez (147), László Kubala (131) and Samuel Eto'o (108).[268] Josep Samitier is the club's highest goalscorer in the Copa del Rey, with 64 goals.[269] László Kubala holds the La Liga record for most goals scored in one match, with seven goals against Sporting Gijón in 1952.[270] Lionel Messi co-holds the Champions League record with five goals against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012.[271] Eulogio Martínez became Barça's top goalscorer in a cup game, when he scored seven goals against Atlético Madrid in 1957.[266] Barcelona goalkeepers have won a record number of Zamora trophies (20), with Antoni Ramallets and Víctor Valdés winning a record five each. Valdés had a ratio of 0.832 goals-conceded-per-game, a La Liga record,[272] and he also holds the record for longest period without conceding a goal (896 minutes) in all competitions for Barcelona.[273] Claudio Bravo has the record of best unbeaten start in a season in La Liga history, at 754 minutes.[274][275] Barcelona's longest serving manager is Jack Greenwell, with nine years in two spells (1917–1924) and (1931–1933), and Pep Guardiola is the club's most successful manager (14 trophies in 4 years). The most successful Barcelona player is Lionel Messi with 35 trophies, surpassing Andrés Iniesta, with 32 trophies.[276] Barcelona's Camp Nou is the largest stadium in Europe. The club's highest home attendance was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986.[277] The modernisation of Camp Nou during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.[278] El Barça de les Cinc Copes is the first team in Spanish football to have won five trophies in a single season (1951–1952).[279][280][281] Barcelona is the only club to have played in every season of European competitions since they started in 1955 counting non-UEFA competition Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.[282][283] On 18 December 2009, alongside being the only Spanish club to achieve a continental treble, Barcelona became the first ever European football team to win six trophies in a calendar year (Sextuple).[284][285] In January 2018, Barcelona signed Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool for €120 million, the highest transfer fee in club's history.[286][287] In August 2017, Barcelona player Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record transfer fee of €222 million.[288][289] In 2016, Barcelona's La Masia was ranked second by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) as the most top-level players producing academy in the world.[290] The club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm.[32] The club shared Barcelona's coat of arms, as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one.[291] In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.[292] The blue and garnet colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900.[293] Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and garnet design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel.[294][295] Since 1998, the club has had a kit deal with Nike. In 2016, the deal was renewed until 2028 for a record €155 million per year. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime if Barcelona fail to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[302][303] In 2023, Barcelona became the revenue leader from the sale of kits and merchandising in Europe with a turnover of €179 million.[304][305] Although Spanish clubs first began displaying sponsor names on their shirts in 1981,[306] Barcelona held off having a name across the front of the shirt until 2006, when the club signed an agreement to have UNICEF's name on their front.[307][308] Unlike traditional deals, this was not to have paying money to the club, but instead to have the club raise money for UNICEF. In 2011, the club signed its first commercial shirt sponsorship deal, when it reached an agreement with Qatar Foundation.[309] Throughout its history, the club has had various official songs. The anthem in use today is \"Cant del Barça\" (The Song of Barça), composed in 1974 on the occasion of the club's 75th anniversary. Authors Josep Maria Espinàs and Jaume Picas composed the lyrics in Catalan, while the music was composed by Manuel Valls.[316][317] The song was first performed on 27 November 1974 at Camp Nou before the match between FC Barcelona and the East Germany national team by a 3,500-man choir led by Oriol Martorell. On November 28, 1988, in celebration of the club's centenary, the song was performed by Catalan singer-songwriter Joan Manuel Serrat at the end of the festival at Camp Nou. Since the 2008–09 season, el Cant del Barça has been featured on the official Barcelona jerseys. On the occasion of the club's 124th anniversary and with the start of preparations for the 125th anniversary, the club presented a new anthem version recording faithful to the essence of the original score and lyrics composed in 1974, with a better quality and enhanced orchestration and vocals. Composed by the Vallès Symphony Orchestra, the Orfeó Català choral society and the Cor Jove youth choir, it is the current official version.[318][319] El Cant del Barça is turned on before Barcelona games take place at Camp Nou, especially during matches against Real Madrid and just before the start of the meeting. The song is also often played for supporters and fans to cheer, chant and celebrate the victory. Barcelona initially played on different fields, one of the first to represent a fixed venue was the Camp de la Indústria. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.[320] In 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.[321] After the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games.[321][322][323] The club began to make plans for a new stadium.[321] The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.[321] In 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu.[324][325][326] In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline.[327] It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.[328] In December 2021, a record 88% of the club members voted in favor of the Espai Barça project to revamp the club's sporting facilities, being the first online referendum in FC Barcelona history.[329] Originally projected to have been completed in 2021, renovation work on Camp Nou began on 1 June 2023 and it is now aimed to finish by the end of 2026, with an estimated €1.5 billion net funding.[330][331][332] During the renovation period, Barcelona will move for the entire 2023–24 season to Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Montjuïc, expecting to return in November 2024, with the stadium still under construction.[333] There are also other facilities, which include:[334] Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.[336] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

                "content": "EPL Advertisement live Updated 2m ago Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here While Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, speaking to BBC Match of the Day, said: \"A very good week. It is always weird to play the same opponent twice in three days. To score five goals away from home in this league is never easy. \"You could see in the days before and after he (Gabriel Jesus) was ready. I had no doubts. When a player is in that momentum he has to play. \"Some of the goals were really good from different faces. It was really positive. When he(Declan Rice) came on he gave us something else in the game. He grabbed the game and gave us control. \"We are in a really good moment. We have not lost in 10 matches, we have won five out of seven and we deserved to win all of them. We are coping with a lot of things. The team is adapting and fighting every game.\" Advertisement Getty Images Mikel Arteta says Bukayo Saka will have tests to determine the extent of a hamstring injury picked up during Arsenal's 5-1 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday. The 23-year-old forward was forced off 24 minutes into the first half at Selhurst Park. Saka clutched the back of his right leg after attempting a cross from the byline and immediately signalled to the Arsenal dugout that he was unable to continue. Asked for an update on Saka, who was later seen leaving Selhurst Park on crutches, Arteta said: \"He felt something in his hamstring. He could not continue. He will have to be assessed. We are pretty worried about that one.\" Saka had started in all but one of Arsenal's 17 Premier League games so far this season, missing the 2-0 defeat at Bournemouth in October through injury. The England international is now a doubt for a crucial festive period that sees Arsenal play three games in nine days. GO FURTHER Mikel Arteta admits concern over Bukayo Saka hamstring injury: ‘We are pretty worried’ Getty Images Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner told Sky Sports after the match: \"It's crazy when I compare the performance in the first half to the Emirates (in the Carabao Cup). It was far better today but we were 3-1 down and there we had the lead. \"We defended the box terrible, they punished us. If you want to beat a team like Arsenal everything has to be almost perfect. It was not good enough today. In the box too many times we watched their players. \"When you concede five it is unlikely you get a point! But we had big chances in the second half and then they scored and the game was over. We lost the belief to come back again. We gifted them the goals. \"From the first 60 minutes we can take a lot of positives. We have to defend the box but everything else one of our best performances. Of course, we will learn from it. We have to learn that when you give the top teams a crumb, they take the whole cake!\" Speaking to Sky Sports after the match, Arsenal goalscorer Gabriel Jesus said: \"Obviously the first goal was very important early. The way we started, the full team was really ready to play well and fight. \"I am very happy with the goals as a number nine, I know the pressure is always on to score. I’m the type of guy that wants to work hard. I know my qualities, I know I can score. I put two in the net and missed one I will be dreaming of. \"When I play with a smile on my face everything is different so I am trying to keep my mind strong and just help the team. I understand I have to be more in the box to finish the action. It is great to be back in the team playing more. \"I am happy to get more chances but it is up to me to put myself in the right places to score. It is Arsenal, it is a huge club and I know the pressure for the number nine to score is there.\" Getty Images The home supporters will be feeling Grinch-like, I'm sure, on their way home. Advertisement Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi, speaking to Premier League Productions after the match, said: \"We're disappointed. It's not nice to lose that way. Heads are down and we have to go again. There's moments we create for ourselves every single game, today we didn't take them and they did. \"But I think tonight it was about both boxes. When we look back on it we didn't defend well and a top team like Arsenal will punish you. We have to go again, look at the areas we can improve and take this game with a pinch of salt.\" \"We should have done better with the goal they scored when it was two versus two, but we didn't follow our men on the second phase. Other than that I thought we actually dealt with their set pieces quite well.\" Getty Images They're definitely enjoying themselves! Gabriel Jesus has scored five goals in his last two games for Arsenal in all competitions (all vs Crystal Palace this week). That's as many as he had in his previous 45 appearances for the Gunners. Getty Images Arsenal (won eight, drawn two) are the first team to remain unbeaten in Premier League London derbies across a full calendar year since Chelsea in 2005. It’s the first time the Gunners have done so since 2004. Advertisement Gabriel Jesus had scored two Arsenal goals in the whole of 2024 before his hat-trick against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday but made it five in four days with two in a 5-1 Premier League victory at Selhurst Park. Ismaila Sarr had equalised for Palace in a frantic opening — the goals coming after 6, 11 and 14 minutes — before Kai Havertz added a third, Gabriel Martinelli and Declan Rice grabbing the fourth and fifth. An apparent hamstring injury for Bukayo Saka in the first half when running at pace was the main worry for Arsenal from the game. And below, The Athletic’s Jordan Campbell breaks down the key talking points. GO FURTHER Crystal Palace 1 Arsenal 5 – Is Jesus the answer? How worrying is Saka’s injury? Arsenal have scored five or more goals in six different away games in all competitions in 2024, the most ever by an English top-flight club in a single calendar year. Getty Images Palace will want to move on quickly after that. Sure they'll take plenty of lessons from it but probably a good thing that they play again relatively soon. Just a weird game but not a great performance. Arsenal's last four away games: Not bad! Getty Images That's it! Arsenal win 5-1 in south London to record their second win against Crystal Palace in four days. A match to forget for Palace. Advertisement 90+5' Crystal Palace 1-5 Arsenal Into the fifth and final minute of stoppage time. Ref Simon Hooper gives another free-kick to Arsenal for a minuscule foul. This has been a bit of a miserable evening for Palace but there are genuinely some positives to take. They've created chances and threatened Arsenal. Given they were the league's second lowest scorers not so long ago, that is encouraging. They have scored in each of their last seven games in all competitions. Ismaila Sarr has been excellent again. Getty Images Declan Rice was presumably brought on to bring structure and solidity to the midfield, but he's produced a lovely finish there to set the seal on this victory.",

                "title": "Crystal Palace 1-5 Arsenal: Three Gabriels drive Gunners glory - NBC Sports",
                "content": "It was all about the Gabriels for the Gunners on Saturday, where Gabriel Jesus scored twice, Gabriel Martinelli chipped in another, and Gabriel Magalhaes recorded an assist and led possession from the back line in a 5-1 Arsenal win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Sunday’s trip to south London to face Crystal Palace felt like the rejuvenation of their Premier League title hopes after a tough couple of weeks for the Gunners. Yet an injury to Bukayo Saka looms over the good vibes. WATCH FULL REPLAY Declan Rice came off the bench to produce a goal and an assist in the win, while Kai Havertz also scored in the big win. Arsenal moves onto 33 points, a point back of Chelsea and three behind Liverpool. The Gunners have played two more games than the Reds and one more game than the Blues. Ismaila Sarr scored for Palace, who were sent back to earth by Arsenal in the League Cup at midweek and now in the Premier League as well. Their 16 points are four above the bottom three. No one’s saying that an oft-injured star delivering five goals in two games should stop Arsenal from going into the transfer market for help at center forward in January, but maybe the Gunners can play it a little safer with who joins their crew rather than pay through the nose to start 2025. Think back to the 2022-23 when Jesus arrived in North London from Manchester City and inspired many to consider him the final piece to Arsenal’s title challenge. It’s easy to call that short-sighted now, but Jesus also has not been healthy since then. If — and it’s a huge if — Jesus can fire forward with vigor, then he’s perfectly suitable to serving as the No. 9 for Arsenal. The Gunners still must address the situation and shouldn’t hesitate if they find a top target at a price they’d pay most windows, but they can also feel a little bit less desperate and express that to would-be sellers looking for Premier League dollars. And if you disagree with all of that, you can at least acknowledge that the 27-year-old Jesus — who also played a role in the third, fourth, and fifth Arsenal goals — should be front-and-center in each of the next few games as Arsenal look to chase down Chelsea and Liverpool. (from fotmob.com) Crystal Palace vs Arsenal player ratings (from fotmob.com) Crystal Palace vs Arsenal player ratings (from fotmob.com) Arsenal host Ipswich Town at 3:15pm ET Friday, then go to Brentford on New Year’s Day for a 12:30pm kickoff. Palace go to Bournemouth at 10am ET on Boxing Day (Thursday), then host Southampton at 10am Sunday in two big games that will help determine whether this season is about a relegation scrap or a fight for midtable. Kick off time: 12:30 pm ET Saturday (December 21)Venue: Selhurst Park — LondonTV Channel: USA NetworkStreaming: Watch live on NBCSports.com Gabriel Jesus 6', 15', Ismaila Sarr 12', Kai Havertz 38', Gabriel Martinelli 60', Declan Rice 84' The North Londoners are just toying with their southern rivals. Rice spins and fires off good work from Jesus and Riccardo Calafiori, his shot spinning across goal and inside the far corner. Minutes are here for ex-Arsenal man Eddie Nketiah in place of Daichi Kamada, while minutes later Oliver Glasner removes Will Hughes and Jefferson Lerma for Justin Devenny and Cheick Doucoure. 4-1 into the final quarter-hour. Trossard cues up Jesus for the hat trick but Henderson blocks his shot. Rice lines up the rebound and his shot is deflected past Henderson by the plant foot of a just-onside Martinelli. Declan Rice and Riccardo Calafiori enter for Kai Havertz and Myles Lewis-Skelly. 3-1 Arsenal, 59'. Palace counter attack with style. Jean-Phillipe Mateta smashes a shot toward Arsenal’s goal and Raya flies to parry it into the air. Sarr is on the doorstep to bid at the low-speed rebound, and nods it to Raya’s right. The Spaniard dives to collect it before it can reach the goal line. Still 3-1 Arsenal, now in the 54th minute. Both teams have been open and taken their fair share of shots — 8-7 to Palace at the moment — but Arsenal have delivered more of the true dangerous stuff. Jesus’ brace gives him five goals in two games going back to the midweek League Cup triumph over these same Eagles. I guess we can wait to see if his hot streak exists outside of Palace opposition, but his finishing is a breath of fresh air for Arsenal. The Gunners have 60% possession and should get all three points, but Saka’s injury looms over the proceedings. Gabriel Martinelli beats Mitchell on the right wing, and rescues the ball off the end line with a cross to the heart of the box. Jesus rises high to head toward goal but clips the post. Havertz is there to push the ball over the line. The Eagles center back gives the ball away to Gabriel Jesus, who dodges a desperation slide from Chris Richards to appear 1v1 with Dean Henderson. But Palace’s goalkeeper is not called into action, as ex-Wolfsburg star Lacroix races back to make a sliding denial of Jesus inside the 18. Still 2-1 Arsenal. 38'. A worrying moment for the Gunners, who lose a man with five goals and 10 assists in 16 Premier League appearances this season. Bukayo Saka limps off on his own power after just 25 minutes, replaced by Leandro Trossard. We’ll have updates as soon as we hear from the Gunners or Mikel Arteta. Raya saves the day this time. Mateta is 1v1 with the Arsenal keeper and denied by the Spaniard, with Saliba clearing the rebound to trigger a Gunners counter that comes to nothing. Martinelli’s corner (of course) toward the back post falls for Thomas Partey, Back to goal, Partey lays the ball into the path of Gabriel Jesus for a hammered finish. Arsenal back in front, and it’s glorious for the Gunners if Jesus is going to get back to his best in their shirt. He’s in-form, and Palace are level. Tyrick Mitchell takes the ball on the left wing and drives toward goal, snapping a quick-release shot inside Raya’s far post. David Raya plays with the ball inside his six and he’s under pressure. He forces a short pass to Thomas Partey, and Palace slide in and nearly push the ball home off the press. Oh he’s been waiting for this, and Gabriel Jesus cleans up a loose ball in style. Great start for the Gunners. Underway, with Palace in their blue and red home tops and Arsenal in teal/sky blue and purple. Henderson, Clyne, Richards, Lacroix, Guehi, Mitchell, Lerma, Hughes, Kamada, Sarr, Mateta Raya, Timber, Saliba, Magalhaes, Lewis-Skelly, Partey, Havertz, Odegaard, Saka, Martinelli, Jesus Mikel Arteta’s side has draw their last two PL games and failed to capitalize on leaders Liverpool also drawing twice and having a game postponed. Now, Arsenal sit 3rd in the table after red-hot Chelsea surged past them and to within two points of the summit. Arteta celebrated five years in charge at Arsenal on Friday, with the lone trophy of his tenure coming in his first (partial) season, the 2019-20 FA Cup. After finishing 2nd to Manchester City the last two years, many thought this would be the year the young Gunners broke through — especially with City tearing apart at the seams — but they have been far too inconsistent and only won half of their 16 games thus far (8W-6D-2L). If they don’t score from a set piece (23 since the start of last season - 5 more than any other side in Europe) and Bukayo Saka doesn’t put the team on his back, Arsenal have struggled mightily to consistently generate scoring chances. Speaking of which, Crystal Palace’s attacking struggles appear to be a thing of the past now after Oliver Glasner’s side blew rivals Brighton away in a 3-1 victory last weekend and nearly beat Man City before that. Now they’re five games unbeaten (2W-3D-0L) after winning just 1 of their first 11 games to start the season. Ismaila Sarr is looking right at home back in the PL after signing from Marseille in the summer. The Senegalese winger had 2 goals and an assist against Brighton and has played a part in 5 goals in as many games. Palace have lost five straight to Arsenal, including Wednesday’s League Cup quarterfinal. OUT: Adam Wharton (groin), Daniel Munoz (suspension), Rob Holding (undisclosed), Matheus Franca (groin) | QUESTIONABLE: Chadi Riad (fitness) OUT: Ben White (knee), Takehiro Tomiyasu (knee) | QUESTIONABLE: Oleksandr Zinchenko (undisclosed) Perhaps Gabriel Jesus’ hat trick in the League Cup will spark life in someone other than Saka. Palace will try to play a bit more being at home, which should give Arsenal a bit more time and space themselves — if they dare take it. Crystal Palace 1-2 Arsenal. A Division of NBCUniversal.

                "content": "Sport | Football Crystal Palace vs Arsenal – LIVE! Arsenal have returned to winning ways in the Premier League after beating Crystal Palace for the second time in a week. Gabriel Jesus - after scoring a hat-trick when the two sides met in the Carabao Cup quarter-final on Wednesday night was rewarded with a start and that decision was vindicated twice inside the opening 15 minutes as he scored a brace - either side of Ismaila Sarr’s equaliser - to end his Premier League goalscoring drought that had stretched all the way back to January. The Brazilian was inches away from completing a first-half hat-trick when his brilliant header came back off the post, though Kai Havertz was on hand to convert the rebound to give the visitors a two-goal cushion at the break. The Gunners had David Raya to thank for twice keeping out efforts from Sarr and also denying Jean-Philippe Mateta early in the second half. Gabriel Martinelli added a fourth on the hour mark before Declan Rice netted his first Premier League goal of the season to complete the rout and now Arsenal will sit back and hope for a favour from Everton and Tottenham on Sunday. The one negative was the injury to Bukayo Saka in the first-half. Holding his hand up instantly as soon as he crossed the ball, he headed straight down the tunnel for treatment with a suspected hamstring issue. Crystal Palace vs Arsenal FC latest news Live updates William Saliba 5 A rare off-night for the Frenchman, who was sloppy. Backed off Sarr for his goal and Mateta caused him problems, too. Gabriel 7 Grabbed an assist for Jesus’ first goal and then hit the crossbar with a header. Played a stunning pass to help create the fourth goal. Myles Lewis-Skelly 7 Given a second Premier League start in a row with Riccardo Calafiori only fit enough for the bench. Another promising performance and the 18-year-old looks a genuine option at left-back now. Click here for the Arsenal player ratings! Comfortable in the end for the Gunners as they beat the Eagles for the second time this week. 90 min: Five additional minutes have been signalled here at Selhurst Park. 84 min: IT’S FIVE! Declan Rice gets in on the act as he scores his first Premier League goal of the season. That’s the cue for more changes as Gabriel Jesus and Jurrien Timber are replaced by Ethan Nwaneri and Mikel Merino. Arsenal's midfield has tightened up a lot since Rice came on. Havertz looked good going forward, but perhaps one of the sacrifices of playing him there is you lose the solidity Rice or Merino bring as the left No8 in this system. 80 min: Double change for Palace as Kporha and Schlupp replace Clyne and Mateta. 79 min: Nathaniel Clyne picks up a yellow card after catching Riccardo Calafiori on the ankle. The challenge certainly left the Arsenal defender in pain and is receiving treatment. 77 min: Gabriel Martinelli’s goal has really taken the sting out of the game. Prior to the strike, Palace were looking dangerous. 74 min: Problem for Crystal Palace here as Marc Guehi is struggling. Looks like the issue is his right shoulder. Oliver Glasner will not want to lose his captain. 71 min: Gabriel Martinelli puts Leandro Trossard through but Mitchell does well to get back at the Arsenal forward. The Gunners then recycle the ball and end up winning a corner as Gabriel Jesus’ header is deflected behind.

                "content": "Travis Michael Kelce (/ˈkɛlsi/ ⓘ KEL-see;[a] born October 5, 1989) is an American professional football tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Chiefs in the third round of the 2013 NFL draft and later won Super Bowls LIV, LVII, and LVIII with the team. He played college football for the University of Cincinnati Bearcats football program. Considered one of the greatest tight ends of all time,[11][12] Kelce is a nine-time Pro Bowler and a seven-time All-Pro, with four first-team and three second-team selections. He holds the NFL records for most consecutive and most overall seasons with 1,000 receiving yards by a tight end: seven.[4] He holds the record for most receiving yards by a tight end in a single season with 1,416 in 2020, despite playing in only 15 games.[5][13] During the 2022 season, Kelce became the fifth NFL tight end to reach 10,000 career receiving yards and reached the milestone faster than any tight end in NFL history.[4] Kelce was named to the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team.[14][15] During the 2023 season, he surpassed Jerry Rice in career playoff receptions en route to Super Bowl LVIII, his fourth Super Bowl appearance in five seasons. Outside of football, Kelce has appeared on reality and scripted television, including being the namesake of the dating show \"Catching Kelce\" on E!, hosting the March 5, 2023, episode of Saturday Night Live, and in advertisements. He co-hosts the podcast New Heights with his brother Jason, covering topics from football to popular culture. The show was ranked as the 8th most popular show in the US on Apple Podcasts in 2024.[16] Kelce's relationship with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift has drawn massive media coverage and stimulated viewership and revenue for his team and its league. Kelce was born on October 5, 1989, in Westlake, Ohio. His father, Ed Kelce, is a former sales representative in the steel industry, and his mother, Donna, is a former bank executive. Kelce's older brother Jason played center for the Philadelphia Eagles for 13 seasons.[17] Kelce attended Cleveland Heights High School in his hometown of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, where he played football, basketball, and baseball.[18] He was a three-year letter winner as quarterback for the Tigers. As a senior in 2007, he ran for 1,016 yards and 10 touchdowns and threw for 1,523 yards, 21 touchdowns, and eight interceptions. His 2,539 yards of total offense garnered him All-Lake Erie League honors.[19][20] Considered a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, Kelce accepted a scholarship offer from the University of Cincinnati over offers from Akron, Eastern Michigan, and Miami (OH).[21] He joined his brother, Jason Kelce, who was the starting left guard for the Bearcats. After redshirting in 2008, he appeared in 11 games in 2009, playing at tight end and quarterback out of the Wildcat formation. He tallied eight rushes for 47 yards and two touchdowns and had one reception for three yards.[22] He was suspended for the 2010 season after testing positive for marijuana, a violation of team rules.[23][24] Returning for the 2011 season, he played tight end, recording 13 catches totaling 150 yards and two touchdowns.[25] In 2012, his last collegiate season, he set personal season highs in receptions (45), receiving yards (722), yards per receptions (16.0), and receiving touchdowns (8). Kelce earned first-team all-conference honors[26] and in March 2013, was named the College Football Performance Awards Tight End of the Year.[27] Kelce graduated in 2022 with a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies degree,[28] he received his diploma during an April 2024 podcast event at the Fifth Third Arena with his brother Jason.[29] Kelce was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round (63rd pick overall) of the 2013 NFL draft.[33] The Chiefs had hired Andy Reid as their new head coach during the off-season. Reid was familiar with Kelce, having drafted and coached his brother, Jason Kelce, in 2011 during his time as the head coach of the Eagles.[34][35] On June 6, 2013, the Chiefs signed Kelce to a four-year, $3.12 million rookie contract that also included a signing bonus of $703,304.[36] Kelce injured his knee in the preseason. The injury was later diagnosed as a bone bruise.

Some NFL games that Swift attended broke viewership, ticket sales, and merchandise sales records:[263] a Chiefs–Chicago Bears game drew the most television viewers of the weekend;[264] a Chiefs–New York Jets game averaged 27 million viewers, making it the most-watched Sunday-night television show since Super Bowl LVII;[265] and a Chiefs–Buffalo Bills game on January 21, 2024, became the most-watched NFL divisional playoff game ever and the most-watched program on any network since Super Bowl LVII.[266] The Chiefs–Baltimore Ravens AFC Conference Championship Game was the most watched AFC Championship game of all time.[267] When the Chiefs advanced to Super Bowl LVIII, some referred to the game as the \"Taylor Swift Bowl\".[268][269][270][271] One widely cited estimate by a sports marketing company said the Kelce–Swift relationship had so stimulated ticket sales, viewership, and merchandising that the Chiefs franchise had gained $331.4 million in value in six months.[272] In June 2024, Kelce joined Swift onstage at her Eras Tour concert in Wembley Stadium, dancing in a top hat and tails during her performance of \"I Can Do It with a Broken Heart\".[273] Kelce plays golf during the offseason.[274] He has participated in several celebrity tournaments, including the American Century Championship, at which he won the long drive contest in the 2023 edition.[274][275] In 2023, he participated in The Match VIII, teaming up with his Chiefs teammate Patrick Mahomes against Golden State Warriors teammates Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Mahomes and Kelce won.[276] Kelce owns homes in the Kansas City area[277] and a condo in Orlando, Florida.[278] He is also an avid car collector.[279]",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs Missed last two Chiefs road games Despite Taylor Swift's absence from Travis Kelce's last two NFL games, the couple is reportedly doing just fine. Kelce has never expected Swift to be present for every game, and an old interview from 2016 has resurfaced to support this, revealing that he's comfortable with his partner not attending all his matches. In the interview, Kelce was promoting his reality show \"Catching Kelce,\" where he eventually met his ex, Maya Benberry. During the conversation, he shared that while having a supportive partner is important to him, he doesn't expect them to attend every single game, as long as they cheer him on when they do make it to the stands. \"If you're dating a professional athlete, I do not believe, at least for me, that you have to go to all the games,\" Kelce said. \"I mean, there's 8 home games, 8 away games, plus playoffs. I don't even expect my parents and my friends to make every single game.\" This was back when the NFL played a 16-game schedule. Now, there's an added game. \"I need her to cheer when we're doing awesome, just to make sure that that look is being presented to everyone.\" Swift attended Kelce's first two home games of the season in Kansas City but was not present for the Chiefs' recent away games in Atlanta and Los Angeles. Despite her absence, TMZ sources close to the couple confirm that their relationship is still going strong, with no signs of tension over her decision to miss a few matchups. \"If she is going to a place that isn't Arrowhead, there are security concerns,\" a Page Six source said. \"She has worked with Arrowhead so many times, they feel at ease and comfortable. Going to all kinds of different stadiums, you need to send a team in advance.\" © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "title": "Russell Wilson - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Russell Carrington Wilson (born November 29, 1988) is an American professional football quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL). He previously played 10 seasons for the Seattle Seahawks and two seasons for the Denver Broncos. With the Seahawks, Wilson was named to the Pro Bowl nine times and helped Seattle win their first Super Bowl championship in Super Bowl XLVIII. He is regarded as one of the greatest dual-threat quarterbacks of all time.[1] Wilson played college football and baseball for the NC State Wolfpack from 2008 to 2010 before transferring to the Wisconsin Badgers in 2011, where he set the single-season FBS record for passer rating and led them to a Big Ten title and the 2012 Rose Bowl. He also played minor league baseball for the Tri-City Dust Devils in 2010 and the Asheville Tourists in 2011 as a second baseman. The Seattle Seahawks selected Wilson in the third round (75th overall) of the 2012 NFL draft. He tied the rookie record for most passing touchdowns and was named Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year.[2] Wilson then led the Seahawks to consecutive Super Bowl appearances, winning Super Bowl XLVIII and losing Super Bowl XLIX after Wilson was intercepted at the goal line by Malcolm Butler. Wilson holds the record for most wins by an NFL quarterback through nine seasons and is one of five quarterbacks with a career passer rating over 100.[3] In 2019, he signed a four-year, $140 million contract extension with the Seahawks, becoming the highest-paid NFL player at the time. In 2020, he became the third quarterback in NFL history to throw 30 touchdowns in four consecutive seasons.[4] Wilson was traded to the Broncos in 2022 and later signed a five-year, $245 million extension. His time with the Broncos was marred with disappointment, with the Broncos having the league's worst scoring offense in 2022. Wilson was benched near the end of the 2023 season and was released in the offseason, later signing a one-year deal with the Steelers. Noted for his philanthropy, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won the 2019 MLS Cup. Wilson was born at The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati,[5] and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. His parents are Harrison Benjamin Wilson III, a lawyer, and Tammy Wilson (née Turner), a nurse director.[6][7][8] He has an older brother, Harrison IV, and a younger sister, Anna.[9] Wilson started playing football with his father and brother at the age of four, and played his first organized game for the Tuckahoe Tomahawks youth football team in sixth grade.[6][10] Wilson's great-great-grandfather was enslaved to a Confederate colonel and was freed after the American Civil War.[11] Wilson's paternal grandfather, Harrison B. Wilson Jr., was a former president of Norfolk State University who played football and basketball at Kentucky State University, and his paternal grandmother, Anna W. Wilson, was on the faculty at Jackson State University.[12] Wilson's maternal grandfather was noted painter A. B. Jackson.[13] According to genetic admixture analysis, Wilson is 62% African, 36% European, 1% West Asian, and 1% Central Asian.[14][15][16] His European family lineage has been traced back to 524 A.D. to Saint Arnulf of Metz via Charlemagne.[17][18][19][20][21] Wilson has also said he has some Native American ancestry, although he did not explicitly say which tribe he came from.[22][23] Wilson's father played football and baseball at Dartmouth and was a wide receiver for the San Diego Chargers preseason squad in 1980. Wilson's brother, Harry, played football and baseball at the University of Richmond, and his sister Anna played basketball at Stanford.[24][25][26][27][28] Wilson's father died of complications from diabetes on June 9, 2010, at age 55,[24] the day after Wilson was drafted by the Rockies.[29] Wilson attended Collegiate School, a preparatory school in Richmond, Virginia.[30] As a junior in 2005, he threw for 3,287 passing yards and 40 passing touchdowns and rushed for 634 rushing yards and 15 rushing touchdowns.[31] He was named an all-district, all-region, and all-state player. Wilson was twice named the Richmond Times-Dispatch Player of the Year.[32] As a senior, he threw for 3,009 passing yards, 34 passing touchdowns, and seven interceptions. In addition, he rushed for 1,132 yards and 18 touchdowns.[33] That year, he was named an all-conference and all-state player as well as conference player of the year. He was featured in Sports Illustrated for his performance in the state championship game win. Wilson also served as his senior class president.[34] During his time in high school, Wilson attended the Manning Passing Academy, a summer football clinic run by multiple NFL MVP winner and eventual Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning. Due to this encounter, Manning recognized Wilson many years later when the latter had flown to Denver to discuss the prospect of getting drafted by the Denver Broncos, where Manning had recently signed.[35] Wilson was also a member of the Collegiate School basketball and baseball teams.[36] Sources: Wilson committed to North Carolina State University on July 23, 2006.[37] He also received a football scholarship offer from Duke University.[38] Wilson redshirted during the 2007 season at NC State.[39] In 2008, Wilson initially split time at quarterback with senior Daniel Evans and junior Harrison Beck.[40] However, Evans and Beck saw no regular season action after Week 2 and Week 5, respectively. Thereafter, Wilson led the team to a 4–3 record in the regular season which NC State finished out on a four-game winning streak.[41] During a 30–24 win over East Carolina, Wilson threw for 201 yards and three touchdowns.[42] He threw for two touchdowns in each of the last six games in the regular season.[43] In the 2008 PapaJohns.com Bowl against Rutgers, Wilson threw for 186 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 46 yards before halftime. Late in the first half, he scrambled to the Rutgers' four-yard line, where he was tackled and suffered a knee sprain. With Wilson sitting out the remainder of the game, his replacements threw a combined total of three interceptions with NC State, eventually losing 29–23.[44][40] Over the course of the season, he completed 150 of 275 attempts for 1,955 yards and 17 touchdowns with just one interception. He also recorded 116 carries for 394 yards and four touchdowns.[43] The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) named him the first-team All-ACC quarterback. It was the first time in conference history that a freshman quarterback was named to the first team.[45] Prior to the 2009 season, Wilson was named quarterback of the pre-season all-ACC football team on July 12. On September 19, Wilson broke Andre Woodson's all-time NCAA record of 325 consecutive pass attempts without an interception against Gardner–Webb.[46] The 379-pass streak ended in a game against Wake Forest on October 3.[47] Wilson held the record until November 10, 2012, when it was broken by Louisiana Tech quarterback Colby Cameron.[48] Wilson was named honorable mention All-ACC in 2009.[49] Wilson finished the 2009 regular season with 3,027 passing yards, 31 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions as the team finished with a 5–7 record.[50][51] Wilson led the 2010 Wolfpack to a 9–4 season that included a 23–7 win over West Virginia in the 2010 Champs Sports Bowl.[52][53] He led the ACC in passing yards per game (274.1) and total offensive yards per game (307.5).[54] He was named second-team All-ACC and runner-up for ACC Football Player of the Year.[49] In May 2010, Wilson graduated from NC State in three years with a BA in communication, and took graduate-level business courses in the fall semester during the 2010 football season.[55][56][57][58][59] In January 2011, Wilson announced that he would report to spring training with the Colorado Rockies organization.[60] NC State head coach Tom O'Brien expressed reservations with Wilson's decision, saying \"Russell and I have had very open conversations about his responsibilities respective to baseball and football. While I am certainly respectful of Russell's dedication to baseball these last several years, within those discussions I also communicated to him the importance of his time commitment to NC State football.\"[61] O'Brien and his staff reached out to NFL coaches and general managers on Wilson's behalf, but he failed to receive an invitation to the 2011 NFL Scouting Combine.[62] On April 29, 2011, O'Brien announced that Wilson was granted a release from his football scholarship with one year of eligibility left.[63] On June 27, 2011, Wisconsin head coach Bret Bielema said that Wilson committed to Wisconsin for the 2011 season.[64] In the season opener against UNLV, Wilson passed for 255 yards and two touchdowns in a 51–17 victory. He also rushed for 62 yards, including a 46-yard touchdown run.[65] In the next three games, Wilson threw for three passing touchdowns in each game, victories over Oregon State, Northern Illinois, and South Dakota.[66][67][68] Following a 48–17 victory over previously undefeated #8 Nebraska, Wilson recorded a receiving touchdown in the 59–7 victory over Indiana.[69][70] Wilson helped lead the Badgers to a 6–0 start and a #4 ranking in the AP Poll.[71] The Badgers dropped their next two games, road losses to Michigan State and Ohio State.[72][73] Wilson and the Badgers reeled off four consecutive wins to end the regular season. Wilson was efficient during the winning streak, passing for nine touchdowns to no interceptions while rushing for two touchdowns.[74] At the end of the regular season, Wilson was named first team All-Big Ten by both the coaches and media. He also won the Griese-Brees Big Ten Quarterback of the Year award.[75] In the inaugural Big Ten Championship Game on December 3, Wilson threw for three touchdowns and led the Badgers to a 42–39 win over the Michigan State Spartans. Wilson was named the game's Grange-Griffin MVP.[76] In December 2011, Wilson was named a third team All-American by Yahoo! Sports, and finished ninth in Heisman Trophy voting with 52 points.[77][78] In the 2012 Rose Bowl against the Oregon Ducks on January 2, 2012, Wilson had 19 pass completions on 25 attempts for 296 yards, 18 rushing yards, and three touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) as the Badgers lost by a score of 45–38.[79] Wilson finished the season with 33 passing touchdowns, which set the single season record at Wisconsin and was the second-most in Big Ten history behind Drew Brees during the 1998 season at Purdue (39).[80] Wilson also set the single season FBS record for passing efficiency (191.8).[81] On January 28, 2012, Wilson completed his college football career at the 2012 Senior Bowl.[82] After transferring to the University of Wisconsin, Wilson earned a master's degree in educational leadership and policy analysis.[83] On January 16, 2012, Wilson began training for the NFL Scouting Combine at the IMG Madden Football Academy in Bradenton, Florida.[84][85] Prior to the 2012 NFL draft, Wilson had been projected by NFL scouts and analysts to be a middle-round pick.[86] In February 2012, former NFL quarterback and director of the IMG Madden Football Academy Chris Weinke said of Wilson, \"If he was 6–5, he'd probably be the No. 1 pick in the draft.\"[84] On April 11, 2012, ESPN Monday Night Football analyst Jon Gruden said, \"The only issue with Russell Wilson is his height. That might be the reason he's not picked in the first couple rounds.\"[87] Wilson was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the third round (75th overall) of the 2012 NFL Draft,[91] the sixth quarterback selected.[92] The Seahawks received significant criticism for their selections in the draft, and Wilson in particular, as they had just signed free agent Matt Flynn.[93] Two weeks later, Wilson signed a four-year, $2.99 million contract with the Seahawks on May 7, 2012.[94] Wilson made his preseason debut against the Tennessee Titans on August 11, 2012, and had his first preseason start on August 24 against the Kansas City Chiefs.[95][96] Two days later on August 26, 2012, Wilson was named the starting quarterback for the first regular season game after competing with Matt Flynn and Tarvaris Jackson for the position.[97] On September 9, 2012, Wilson made his regular season debut in a 20–16 road loss to the Arizona Cardinals. He had 18 completions on 34 passing attempts for 153 yards, one touchdown, and one interception.[98] In the third regular season game on Monday night, the Seahawks won 14–12 over the Green Bay Packers on a controversial Hail Mary touchdown pass to Golden Tate.[99] The contentious nature of the replacement officials' decision on the play was widely considered to have been the tipping point that led to an agreement being reached to end the referee lockout.[100][101] Wilson earned Rookie of the Week honors for his performance in a 28–7 victory over the New York Jets on November 11; he completed 12 of 19 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns, and rushed for 34 yards on seven attempts.[102] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week and FedEx Player of the Week for his performance in a 23–17 road win over the Chicago Bears in overtime on December 2.[103] In a 50–17 victory over the Buffalo Bills in Toronto on December 16, Wilson had 205 passing yards, one passing touchdown, nine rushes, 92 rushing yards, and a career-high three rushing touchdowns.[104] He earned NFL Offensive Rookie of the Month honors for December 2012 after the Seahawks went 5–0 and he had a passer rating of 115.2.[105] Wilson finished the 2012 regular season ranked fourth in the NFL in passer rating (100.0), beating the previous rookie record set by Ben Roethlisberger in 2004 (98.1), since broken by Robert Griffin III in 2012 (102.4) and Dak Prescott in 2016 (104.9).[106] He threw for 3,118 yards and 26 touchdowns, tying Peyton Manning's record for most touchdowns thrown by a rookie,[107] and rushed for 489 yards and four touchdowns. Wilson's scrambling mobility and ability to extend plays outside the pocket with his legs earned numerous comparisons to Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton.[108][109][110] Wilson led the Seahawks to the postseason in his rookie year, with both games on the road in January. He made his postseason debut in the NFC Wild Card Round against the Washington Redskins, passing for 187 yards and rushing for 67 yards as the Seahawks rallied for a 24–14 comeback victory.[111] In the Divisional Round against the Atlanta Falcons, Wilson threw for 385 yards and rushed for 60 yards, and his team had a 28–27 lead with 31 seconds to go, but the Falcons managed to kick the winning field goal.[112] Wilson was selected as an alternate for the 2013 Pro Bowl, filling in for Matt Ryan of Atlanta.[113] At the Pro Bowl in Hawaii on January 27, Wilson completed eight of ten passes for 98 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a 147.1 rating.[114] At the end of the season, Wilson earned a bonus of $222,000 through the NFL's Performance-Based Pay program.[115][116] He was ranked 51st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.[117] The Seahawks began the 2013 season with the first 4–0 start in franchise history, before losing to the Indianapolis Colts in Week 5.[118] The Seahawks then went on a 7-game winning streak, including a 41–20 victory over the Minnesota Vikings where he posted a career-high 151.4 passer rating and culminating in a 34–7 victory over the New Orleans Saints in Week 13 in which Wilson threw three touchdown passes and earned his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week award.[119][120][121] Over the next three weeks, the Seahawks suffered divisional losses to the San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals (the loss to the Cardinals was Wilson's first home loss), but defeated the St. Louis Rams in Week 17 to finish the season with a 13–3 record, the NFC West title, and the No. 1 seed in the playoffs.[122] Wilson finished the season with 26 touchdown passes, nine interceptions, and a 101.2 passer rating, becoming the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era to post a 100+ passer rating in each of his first two seasons.[123] Wilson was named to his second Pro Bowl on December 27, 2013.[124] In the Divisional Round, the Seahawks defeated the New Orleans Saints by a score of 23–15.

Wilson threw three first-half interceptions while completing only two passes to his own team as the Seahawks fell behind 16–0 at halftime.

Although the Seahawks led 24–14 heading into the fourth quarter, the Patriots scored two consecutive touchdowns to take a four-point lead with 2:02 remaining.

The Vikings missed a short field goal in the last minute, allowing the Seahawks to advance to the Divisional Round to face the 15–1 Carolina Panthers.[159] Down 31–0 at the half, Wilson helped lead a furious comeback attempt, but the Panthers won 31–24, denying Wilson and the Seahawks their third consecutive in the NFC Championship and a shot at a third consecutive Super Bowl appearance.

However, Wilson drew two minor injuries: his ankle during Week 1 against the Miami Dolphins after getting stepped on by defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh,[164] and his left knee against the 49ers during Week 3 after a takedown by linebacker Eli Harold.[165] The injuries hampered Wilson's trademark mobility, and many speculated that he would be rested in order to properly recover.[166] Regardless, Wilson started all 16 games in the season. On November 20, against the Philadelphia Eagles, he had a 15-yard touchdown reception on a pass from Doug Baldwin on a trick play.[167] Wilson also played the worst game of his career in 2016, throwing 5 interceptions in a 38–10 loss to the Green Bay Packers during Week 14.

D. McKissic, the third of his game, Wilson tied Eli Manning in 2011 for the most fourth quarter touchdowns in a single season with 15.[180] He went 20 for 31 for 227 yards and three touchdowns in that game, earning him NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[181] On December 19, 2017, Wilson was named to his fourth Pro Bowl.[182] The Seahawks ended the season with a 9–7 record, ending Wilson's streak of five consecutive seasons with double-digit wins and a playoff appearance.

Wilson out-dueled the season's eventual MVP Patrick Mahomes to lead the team to a 38–31 victory.

                "content": "By Miguel Angel Fernandez Castro December 19, 2024 08:55AM EDT December 19, 2024 08:55AM EDT By Miguel Angel Fernandez Castro Russell Wilson prepares for the most important game of the season as the Pittsburgh Steelers visit the Baltimore Ravens. Although they have already secured their spot in the playoffs, a win would grant them the AFC North title. However, after the latest loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, experts don’t believe in Mike Tomlin’s team, and they are considered heavy underdogs. The Ravens are currently six-point favorites. Therefore, if the Steelers want to prove they are true Super Bowl contenders, it’s time to show it with a victory against their most hated rival. Wilson sent a message to all his teammates to make that happen. The Steelers have already clinched a playoff spot, but their next goal is the divisional title to secure at least one home game in the Wild Card round. Russell Wilson knows his team can bounce back after the setback in Philadelphia. “I think the most important is we got to focus on now. We don’t have time to even think about last week. I think the most important thing coming out of it though is that we’ve got to get ourselves the best chance to win. When we put ourselves in good situations, go and capitalize on them. We’re going to have to play our best football. It’s going to be a great game.” see also NFL News: Lamar Jackson sends clear message to Mike Tomlin and Steelers about struggles against Pittsburgh The last Super Bowl the Pittsburgh Steelers won was on February 1, 2009, when they defeated Kurt Warner and the Arizona Cardinals with a score of 27-23 in Tampa. The first step to boost their chances this season is to get that victory at Baltimore. With all his experience, Russell Wilson knows this type of games need a different approach. A big warning of what’s ahead. see also NFL News: Mike Tomlin makes something clear to referees after many controversial calls against Steelers “First of all, we got to be able to calm the nerves early and the excitement. We have to be able to play and think clearly, efficiently and effectively. But yet play with an edge. I think that’s really important. We’ve got to do the fundamental things. This is a playoff a matchup. There’s going to be highs and there’s going to be lows. We just have to stay neutral. It’s a four quarter game for a reason. We’re going to battle our way through it.” Miguel Angel Fernandez Castro is a sports writer and analyst at Bolavip US, specializing in NFL, MLB, NBA, College Football, Soccer, Tennis, and Golf.

Growing up in Richmond, Virginia, Russell developed a love for football at a young age. After high school, Russell went played collegiate football at North Carolina State and the University of Wisconsin where he set numerous records and garnered national acclaim. His success led him to be drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in 2012. In his ten seasons with the team, Russell led the Seahawks to more wins than any other quarterback in team history, including a victory in Super Bowl XLVIII (2013). In 2014, he led Seattle to a second straight Super Bowl berth as a two-time NFC Champion (2013, 2014). He has been recognized as one of the league’s top quarterback with nine NFL Pro Bowl selections to date. Russell recently completed his 10th season with the Seahawks and he holds the NFL record for most regular season wins by a QB in his first nine seasons (98) and the second-highest passer rating in NFL history. In Spring 2022, Russell signed with the Denver Broncos and started his first season with the team in Fall 2022. He is currently the quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Off the field, Russell has demonstrated a deep commitment to community service and cause work. In 2014, Russell founded The Why Not You Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to creating real and lasting change in the world by motivating and empowering today’s youth. In addition to financially supporting organizations aligned with the Foundation’s mission, Russell and his wife work to extend the Foundation’s impact by making weekly visits to Seattle Children’s Hospital where he lifts the spirits and brings joy to the hearts of patients and their families. In the fall of 2021, Russell and Ciara celebrated the grand opening of the first Why Not You Academy, a tuition-free charter public high school they founded alongside educational leaders Garth Reeves and Scott Canfield. Why Not You Academy serves systemically underserved students just South of Seattle by providing an innovative and tailored learning experience. In 2020, Russell co-hosted the ESPY Awards with Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe. He led the show with a moving speech about the fight for racial equality in response to movement for Black lives across the world. He was recognized with NFL’s prestigious Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in 2021 which honored his longstanding commitment to giving back. He was also awarded the Bart Starr Award for his service, during the 2022 Super Bowl weekend. In the preceding year, he collaborated with Feeding America and Wheels Up to donate 10 million meals to families experiencing food insecurity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Russell’s leadership, passion and business acumen have resulted in assembling an impressive and diverse portfolio of business ventures. He has landed major endorsements and global ambassadorships with companies including Nike, Microsoft, Wilson, Alaska Airlines, Bose, Amazon, Verizon and Fantatics and he is the lead investor in a Juice Press franchise and TruFusion in Seattle. In 2016, Russell launched a men’s lifestyle apparel line, Good Man Brand, which is sold by major department stores including Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, in addition to having a partnership with Amazon Fashion. The brand’s ethos is drawn from traits Russell found in the good men in his life and the clothing aims to bring out the best in its customers by helping them look good and feel good, so they can live life, work hard and help others. In 2020, Russell expanded his fashion empire with Ciara and together they created The House of LRC, based upon the principles of Love, Respect, and Care. The House of LR&C includes the already established Good Man Brand, Human Nation, a line that promotes the ideas of community, inclusivity, and sustainability, and Lita, an accessible, luxury line for women. As an extension of his work on the field, Russell and the late famed mental conditioning coach Trevor Moawad founded Limitless Minds, a business coaching consultancy dedicated to optimizing performance and enriching culture within some of the world’s top organizations and elite performers. Russell also established the Russell Wilson Quarterback Academy as a springboard to develop quarterback prospects using unique and cutting-edge curriculum based on his own experiences and knowledge. The quarterback school exists as an extension of the Russell Wilson Passing Academy, a summer football camp for children of all ages. Since its inception in 2012, the RWPA has held camps in nine cities and worked with more than 9,000 children. Continuing his commitment creating opportunities for kids to play football, he was recently named the Chairman of NFL Flag and helped found the Russell Wilson NFL Flag league in Seattle. Russell and Ciara also recently announced Why Not You Productions, their production company focused on scripted and unscripted film, television, and digital content projects. Projects through the shingle will focus on inspiring and aspiring narratives and human interest stories. Russell also heads Seattle-based West2East, a brand management, creative content and production company.

                "content": "The Boise State Broncos football program represents Boise State University in college football and competes in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) as a member of the Mountain West Conference. The Broncos play their home games on campus at Albertsons Stadium in Boise, Idaho, and their head coach is Spencer Danielson. Established in 1933, The Broncos have achieved numerous on-field successes, including 22 conference championships, 6 division titles in the Mountain West Mountain Division, and 2 national championships, one in junior college in 1958 and the other in Div 1 FCS in 1980. They have had 7 undefeated seasons (1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1958, 2006, and 2009), and 9 playoff appearances, including a first round bye as the #3 seed in the College Football Playoff in 2024. The program has the longest current streak of winning seasons in college football (FBS Level) with 27 and is 3–0 in the Fiesta Bowl with wins in 2007, 2010, and 2014. As of the end of the 2023 season, the Broncos' all-time winning percentage of .725 is the sixth highest among NCAA FBS football teams, while their 491 total wins ranks 105th.[3] Originally a junior college, Boise State first fielded a football team in 1933 under head coach Dusty Kline.[4] That team compiled a record of 1–2–1 (.375).[4][5] Kline was succeeded by Max Eiden.[5] Under Eiden, the Broncos posted a record of 11–17–1 (.397) from 1934 to 1937.[5] Eiden was succeeded by Harry Jacoby, who coached the team from 1938 to the middle of the 1941 season before being called into Army service. The remainder of the 1941 season was coached by George \"Stub\" Allison, who posted a record of 2–1 (.667).[5] The Broncos did not compete in intramural football from 1942 to 1945 due to having a reduced male student population during World War II.[5] Following the war, Jacoby would return to coach the Broncos for one more season in 1946, posting a final record of 14–15–2 (.484). After a year as an assistant, Lyle Smith was promoted to head football coach of Boise Junior College in 1947. Smith saw incredible success as head coach, winning his first 31 games in a row as head coach. In 1950, the team moved into a new 10,000-seat stadium. With the outbreak of the Korean War, Smith, still undefeated as a head coach, was recalled to the Navy and was only able to coach in the first three games of the 1950 season.[6][7] George Blankley assumed the head coaching duties for the remainder of 1950 and the entire 1951 season in Smith's absence and compiled a 16–2 (.889) record. Smith returned as head coach in 1952 and stretched his winning streak all the way to 37 games before suffering his first defeat. In 1954, Smith was a leading candidate for the vacant job at his alma mater Idaho, but withdrew his name from consideration, content at Boise.[8][9] Boise won thirteen conference titles in football under Smith and the NJCAA National Football Championship in 1958.[10] Smith's final record is 150–25–6 (.845).[5] Coach Smith never had a losing season as the head coach. Boise State's football program moved up to four-year status in 1968 under new head coach Tony Knap and competed as an NAIA independent for two seasons.[11][12] The Broncos were accepted into the NCAA in October 1969,[13] and a month later into the Big Sky Conference, effective the following July.[14] The Broncos began NCAA competition in 1970 in Division II (\"College Division\" prior to 1973) in a brand new Bronco Stadium.[15] Knap and the Broncos won three consecutive Big Sky titles from 1973 to 1975 and compiled a record of 71–19–1.[5] Knap was succeeded by Jim Criner in 1976, a defensive assistant the previous season under Dick Vermeil at UCLA, the Rose Bowl champions. BSU won the Big Sky again in 1977, and in 1978, the Broncos and the Big Sky moved up to the new Division I-AA (renamed FCS in 2006). A scouting violation late that season at NAU resulted in probation and compromised an excellent 10–1 season in 1979, undefeated in conference at 7–0;[16] the Broncos were ineligible for the Big Sky title and I-AA playoffs.[17][18][19] Off probation in 1980, BSU won its first national title, taking the I-AA national championship over defending champion Eastern Kentucky in Sacramento. A runner-up to Idaho State in the Big Sky in 1981, BSU hosted Eastern Kentucky in the I-AA semifinals, but lost, 17–23. Criner departed after the 1982 season to accept the head football coach position at Iowa State;[20] his overall record at BSU was 59–21–1 (.735).[5] Lyle Setencich was promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach of Boise State following Criner's departure. Under Setencich, Boise State posted a 24–20 record in four seasons.[21] Setencich's final season in 1986, the first season of blue turf, saw the first losing campaign (5–6) for the Broncos football program in four decades, winning just one road game and losing the final two home games. He lost all four rivalry games against Idaho and resigned following the season.[21] Skip Hall, previously an assistant coach under Don James at Washington, was hired after Setencich's resignation.[22] In Hall's second season in 1988, the Broncos returned to the Division I-AA playoffs, their first appearance since 1981. Hall's best season was in 1990, when Boise State advanced to the national semifinals, falling in a high scoring game against Big Sky rival Nevada, the conference champion whom the Broncos had defeated a month earlier in Boise. Hall lost all six against Idaho; he resigned after six seasons, with a 42–28 (.600) record.[5][22] The Broncos turned to Portland State head coach Pokey Allen to lead the Boise State football team after Hall resigned. In Allen's second season, the Broncos returned to the championship game in 1994.[23] After 26 years in the Big Sky, BSU joined the Big West Conference in 1996 and moved up to Division I-A (now FBS). The Broncos had an interim head coach for part of 1996 as Allen battled cancer.[24] Allen died due to the cancer in December 1996.[24] Head coach Houston Nutt made the step up to NCAA Division I-A the next year when Boise State hired him away from Murray State to take over the program.[25] Two years after making the Division I-AA finals in 1994, Boise State's first year in Division I-A had been difficult and was looking for a recruiter and motivator to jump start their program following Allen's death. Nutt's team posted a 5–6 record in 1997,[26] playing at the Division I-A level with its Division I-AA players. Nutt's team beat rival Idaho on the road in overtime for the first BSU win in Moscow since 1981. Additionally, Boise State almost pulled off an upset against Wisconsin of the Big Ten. Nutt resigned as head coach after just one season to accept the head football coach position at Arkansas.[27] In three seasons under head coach Dirk Koetter, who previously served as Oregon's offensive coordinator,[28] the Broncos were 26–10, won two Big West championships and moved to the Western Athletic Conference effective in 2001. In his three winning seasons at Boise State, Koetter won ten or more games twice, with two bowl wins. Koetter departed the Broncos after the 2000 season for Arizona State in the Pac-10.[29] Dan Hawkins was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach on December 2, 2000.[30] In 2004, Hawkins was honored with his second Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Coach of the Year title in three years. Through the 2005 season, he compiled a 53–11 record as Boise State's head coach, including a 37–3 record in WAC competition with four straight WAC titles. Only Walter Camp, George Washington Woodruff and Bob Pruett had more total wins in their first five years of head coaching. He holds a 31–game WAC winning streak, the longest in conference history.[31] One of his first hires at Boise State was Chris Petersen as his offensive coordinator; Petersen was a quarterback at UC Davis while Hawkins was an assistant coach, and was the wide receivers coach at Oregon under head coach Mike Bellotti. After five seasons at the helm of the Broncos football program, Hawkins left for Colorado of the Big 12 Conference.[32] He had three top 25 finishes, won ten or more games three times, and won two bowl games. Following Hawkins' departure, offensive coordinator Chris Petersen was promoted to head coach.[33] At Boise State, Petersen won two Paul \"Bear\" Bryant National Coach of the Year Awards, voted on by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association.[34] He is the first coach to receive this award twice, which debuted in 1986 (it has since been awarded twice to Nick Saban and three times to Dabo Swinney). Under Petersen, Boise State recorded two undefeated seasons, three undefeated regular seasons, and reached the Bowl Championship Series twice. The 2006 season was capped with a memorable upset of Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl, while the 2009 team defeated TCU in the Fiesta Bowl to finish at 14–0 and were fourth in both major polls. They were just the second team ever to go 14–0 in the history of major college football. Petersen brought Boise State football its highest ranking during the 2010 season. The team rose to second in the Associated Press poll during weeks 7, 8, and 9, and No. 2 in the Coaches' Poll, as well as earning the No. 3 slot in the first BCS ranking.[35] After 2010, Boise State joined the Mountain West Conference.[36] In May 2011, Boise State Athletics was cited by the NCAA for \"lack of institutional control,\" for one major violation in women's tennis and several minor violations in four sports, including football. While the football program's violations were minor (student athletes provided fellow recruits with meals and beds while visiting campus), the football program suffered serious penalties nonetheless.[37] The Boise State football program was given three years' probation, lost three scholarships a year, and had its number of Fall practices reduced.[38] As a result of the NCAA violations, Gene Bleymaier, the athletic director who brought blue turf to Boise State in 1986 and promoted Petersen 20 years later, was asked to resign, and ultimately fired when he refused.[39] Despite President Bob Kustra's firing of Bleymaier, boosters continued to support him. Just two years later, the new football facility was named in his honor.[40] Between 2008 and 2011, the Broncos went 50–3 to become the first FBS team to win 50 games over a four-year span. With the 50–3 record, quarterback Kellen Moore became the winningest quarterback in FBS history, passing former Texas quarterback Colt McCoy (45 wins). On December 7, 2011, it was announced that the Broncos would join the Big East Conference as football-only members in July 2013, in a division with Memphis, SMU, Houston, San Diego State, and Temple.[41] However, the following year Boise State announced they had decided to stay in the Mountain West Conference, leaving the Big East without ever playing a game in the conference. Petersen accepted the head coaching position at the University of Washington of the Pac-12 Conference on December 6, 2013.[42] The vacancy was created when the Huskies' Steve Sarkisian left to take the head coaching position at USC.[43][44] Petersen finished his eight seasons as head coach of Boise State with a record of 92–12 (.885), with three top 10 finishes, seven seasons with ten or more wins, six top 25 finishes, two Fiesta Bowl titles, five bowl wins, and five conference titles. He was at BSU for a total of 13 years, the first five as offensive coordinator under Hawkins.[45] Assistant head coach Bob Gregory was named interim head coach for Boise State's bowl game.[46] On December 11, 2013, Arkansas State head coach Bryan Harsin returned to his alma mater as Petersen's replacement.[47] Harsin had been an assistant for the Broncos under Petersen and was co-offensive coordinator at Texas under Mack Brown.[47] In his first season in 2014, they went 10–2 in the regular season and won the Mountain West Championship Game, defeating Fresno State 28–14. This was Boise State's first outright Mountain West Conference championship. The Broncos faced the Arizona Wildcats in the Fiesta Bowl and won 38–30 for a 12–2 record and were ranked 15th in both major polls. Boise State shared the Mountain division title in 2016, going 10–3 with wins over Washington State and Oregon State. BSU was 11–3 in 2017 and won their second Mountain west conference championship under Harsin with a 17–14 win over Fresno State in the Mountain West Championship Game. Boise State capped the season with a Las Vegas Bowl win over Oregon and climbed to 22nd in both final polls. In 2018, Boise State was 10–3 overall; they won the Mountain Division championship and beat three teams that won ten or more games (Troy, Utah State, and Fresno State) and were ranked in both final polls. In 2019 Boise State went 12–2 won the opener at Florida State went 8–0 in the Mountain West conference play for the first time in the regular season, won the Mountain Division and won the conference championship 31–10 vs Hawaii and finished ranked in both final polls. Under Harsin, Boise State is 69–19 (.784) through 2020, with at least nine wins per year, a 3–2 record in bowl games, 1 Fiesta Bowl title, Have been ranked in the top 25 in the polls at some point in every season, won three conference titles, five division titles, and have been in the AP final poll four times. On December 22, 2020, Harsin resigned to become the head coach at Auburn.[48] He finished at Boise State with a seven-year record of 69–19. On January 8, 2021, Boise State hired Oregon defensive coordinator Andy Avalos as their new head coach.[49] Avalos, a former player and assistant coach for the Broncos, signed a five-year contract worth $7.75 million.[50] Being on the verge of the team's first losing season since 1997, it was announced on November 12, 2023 that Avalos was being let go.[51] The remainder of his contract would be bought out, an amount near $3 million.[52] He led the Broncos to a 2022 Mountain West Championship Game (L 28–16 to Fresno State) and the 2022 Frisco Bowl, where the Broncos defeated North Texas 35-32. Avalos ended his career as head coach with a record of 22–14 in three seasons. On December 11, 2023, Avalos was hired as defensive coordinator by Texas Christian. [53] After Andy Avalos was let go with two games remaining in the 2023 regular season, Defensive Coordinator Spencer Danielson was announced as the interim head coach for the remainder of the season. Danielson was elevated to full-time head coach after winning the next three games, including the MWC Championship Game at UNLV. Danielson's first game as full-time head coach was against UCLA in the LA Bowl. The Broncos lost 22-35 and finished the season 8-6, with Danielson finishing with a record of 3-1. Head coaching records since Boise State became a four-year school in 1968. NAIA (1968–69), NCAA Division II (1970–77), Division I-AA (1978–95), Division I-A/FBS (1996–present) In 1980, The Big Sky Conference introduced overtime for all their games. This eventually set a precedent which lead to the elimination of all tied contests across the league by 1996. Boise State claims two national titles in the Junior College Division and at the NCAA Division I FCS. § – Conference co–champions † – Division co–champions, did not play in MW Championship Game. Prior to the 2023 season, the Mountain West did away with divisions and established the two top teams with the best in-conference record would play each other for the conference championship. Since joining the Mountain West, Boise State has won five conference championships, which started with the 2012 team, who went 7–1 to tie with Fresno State and San Diego State. The Mountain West held their first Championship Game the following year; Boise State has reached the Championship Game eight times and won five, with each the most among all schools in the conference. The Broncos have appeared in 22 official D-I-A bowl games with a record of 13–8, including two wins in BCS bowl games and one win in a New Year's Six bowl. They also appears in the Division II 1973 Pioneer Bowl, 1971 Camellia Bowl and 1980 Camellia Bowl. Their appearance in the 2018 First Responder Bowl was ruled a no contest after being canceled due to inclement weather. On December 5, 2021, Boise State received a bid to play Central Michigan in the Arizona Bowl. However, On December 27, 2021, Barstool Sports (the title sponsor of the bowl) founder David Portnoy announced the withdrawal of the Broncos from the bowl due to COVID-19 issues within the program. Through the 2024 season, Boise State has a streak of 27 straight seasons of bowl eligibility, which is the longest active streak in the country.[54] † CFP/New Year's Six/BCS game The Broncos were members of Division I-AA for eighteen seasons, from its inception in 1978 through 1995. They appeared in the I-AA playoffs five times with a record of 8–4, and were I-AA national champions in 1980. The Broncos appeared in the Division II playoffs three times, with an overall record of 1–3; all three losses were to the eventual national champions. In 1977, Boise State (9–2) was undefeated in the Big Sky (6–0) and won another title. Due their regular season not ending until November 26 at Idaho, the same day as the first round of the Division II playoffs, BSU was replaced by runner-up Northern Arizona, who lost 35–0 at home. The Broncos had one appearance in the NCAA College Division postseason, with a victory in the West regional final in the Camellia Bowl in 1971.[55] No semifinals or finals were played in the College Division from 1964 through 1972, a poll followed the four quarterfinals. Since 1970, Boise State has played its home games in Albertsons Stadium (known as Bronco Stadium until May 2014), which enjoys a reputation as one of the most difficult places in the country for opposing teams to play. The stadium is well known for its blue artificial surface, first installed in 1986, making it the first college stadium field to be any color other than traditional green, as well as the only college to have a non-green field for 22 years (1986–2008). \"The Blue,\" as it is called by fans, is one of the most distinguishing and enduring symbols of Boise State football. Boise State holds a trademark on any non-green field, not just blue. Therefore, anyone (high school, college, or otherwise) must apply for a license from Boise State before installing a football field any color other than green. Boise State is one of 7 college football programs in the United States to have a non-green playing surface. Other schools with non-green fields are as follows: (FBS) Eastern Michigan University (gray), Coastal Carolina University (teal), (FCS) Eastern Washington University (red), the University of Central Arkansas (grey and purple), (Division II) the University of New Haven (blue), (NAIA) Lindenwood University (red and grey). Hosei University in Tokyo, Japan also has a blue football field. Boise State recently approved the proposal for a blue field at Luther College (Division III). As of December 7, 2019, the Broncos are 128–9 (.934) at home since the 1999 season. The Broncos won 47 straight home conference games from 1999 to 2011 and were undefeated at home in conference play during their 10 years in the WAC (40–0). The Broncos are 122–7 (.946) in regular season home games since 1999, and had a winning streak of 65 regular season games from 2001 to 2011. Their current home winning streak stands at 0. In 2011, citing a \"competitive advantage,\" the Mountain West Conference banned Boise State from wearing their all-blue uniforms for home conference games as a condition of joining the conference.[56] When questioned about the ban, Mountain West Commissioner Craig Thompson confirmed that either the jerseys or pants could be blue, provided that the other be white or orange.[57] After Boise State decided to not join the Big East Conference and remain in the Mountain West the uniform restrictions were lifted beginning in the 2013 season. The NCAA considered a rule that would have required a team's uniform, either jersey or pants, to contrast the playing surface. The rule would have banned Boise State's all blue uniforms at home and most other teams from wearing all green uniforms as well. The NCAA eventually decided against instituting the rule. In 2012, Boise State granted special permission and an international trademark to Hosei University in Tokyo, Japan, for use of the blue field turf for their football field, Tomahawks Field.[58][59] BSU has had a rivalry with Fresno State University since joining the WAC. The series is 17–9 all time in favor of Boise State. In 2001, the series became a WAC match-up, christened with Boise State's upset over No. 8 Fresno State 35–30. In 2005, the series became the Battle for the Milk Can, and No. 20 Fresno State ended Boise State's 31-game winning streak against WAC opponents with their 27–7 victory. After being played as a non-conference game in 2011, the series continued as a conference game in 2012. The winner of the game receives the Milk Can. Although Fresno State has five all-time wins over Boise State, only two wins have come since they have played each other every year since 2001. In the 2014 season, Boise State played Fresno State twice, winning both times, the second one coming in the Mountain West Championship, which Boise State won for the first time. Fresno State was looking to repeat as champions. They met twice in 2017 in back-to-back weeks as they ended the regular season with a game in Fresno, which Fresno won, before meeting the next week in the Mountain West Championship in Boise, which Boise won. In 2018, Boise State upset No. 16 Fresno State 24–17 to end Fresno's seven game winning streak. Three weeks later, the Bulldogs avenged their regular season loss by defeating Boise State 19–16 in overtime in a snow covered Mountain West Championship Game. The rivalry is no longer an annual affair following the expansion of the MW to 12 football members in 2013. At that time, Boise State and Fresno State were placed in separate football divisions (respectively, Mountain and West). As part of the new scheduling arrangement, all cross-divisional games rotate in a four-year cycle, with two years of play followed by two years off. This in turn means that the game was not played in 2015 or 2016. Boise State had a 40-year in-state rivalry with the University of Idaho, which began with a Bronco victory in the first meeting in 1971. They met every year through 2010, and with the exception of four years (2001–2004), the matchup was a conference game. The rivalry was dominated by streaks as Idaho won 12 straight years from 1982 to 1993, while Boise State won the most recent 12 games between 1999 and 2010, mostly by large margins. BSU leads the rivalry with a series record of 22–17–1 (.563). After Boise State's move to the Mountain West Conference in 2011, Boise State has refused to play Idaho home and home in football. As a response, Idaho has refused to play Boise State at ExtraMile Arena for men's basketball. As of 2021, no future games for football or men's basketball have been scheduled; with Idaho having returned to FCS football in 2018, the football rivalry is unlikely to resume in the foreseeable future. 2024 Boise State has a long-standing rivalry with Nevada. Boise State leads the series 30–13. Boise State and Nevada have been conference rivals in the Big Sky Conference, the Big West Conference, the WAC, and the Mountain West. However, the series is no longer an annual affair after the 2013 expansion, as Nevada was placed in the opposite division from Boise State. They play each other only twice every four years. The last game was in 2018 with the next game coming in 2021. The series was played as a non-conference game in 2011 as the teams met in Boise during Nevada's last year in the WAC. Nevada split the WAC championship with Boise State in 2005 as both teams finished 7–1 in conference play. Boise State beat Nevada in the last game of the season in 2006, giving Boise State a berth into their first BCS bowl. In 2007, in one of the highest scoring games in NCAA Division I football history, Boise State defeated Nevada 69–67 in four overtimes. Recently, the conference championship has been decided by the Wolf Pack and Broncos' late-season games. In 2010, Nevada defeated No. 3 Boise State 34–31 in overtime, ending the Broncos' BCS National Championship hopes. The rivalry between the two schools felt as if it had been rekindled after Nevada's win, since Boise State had won the past 10 games dating back to 1998. Boise State and Nevada have played one time in the postseason in the 1990 I-AA semifinal. Nevada won the game in triple overtime 59–52, and would go on to lose in the final. Announced schedules as of September 10, 2024.[60][61] Previously called the Quarterback of the Year Award, this accolade differs from Sammy Baugh Trophy in that it goes to top quarterback, rather than the top passer. Its name was changed to its current identity in 2012, honoring two-time winner Kellen Moore, who became the FBS all-time leader in wins by a quarterback after going 50–3 as the starter at Boise State.",

The Hall of Fame is not only home to the history of Boise State’s successful athletes and teams, it is the only public entrance to view the home of Boise State football and the famous blue turf.* Boise State Football has a long history of success starting with the Junior College days and the National Championship team of 1958, coached by the father of Bronco Football, Lyle Smith. Now named Lyle Smith Field in Albertsons Stadium, the turf field was actually the typical, non-interesting green before getting its proud moniker after the 1985 season. Installed in the summer of 1986, THE BLUE was the idea of Athletic Director Gene Bleymaeir and was the first non-green, artificial football field in the country. What outsiders initially considered a gimmick, calling it “Smurf Turf’ after the popular, amiable and blue cartoon characters, THE BLUE soon became nationally associated with Boise State as a symbol for the football program’s blue-collar work ethic. Opponents don’t find it so friendly either. With the closing of the 2018 season, Boise State football holds a home record of 182-39 (14 Conference Championships) since THE BLUE was installed prior to the 1986 season. The program has lost only nine times on its home field since the start of the 1999 season. You can view the turf by entering through the Allen Noble Hall of Fame in Southwest corner of Albertsons Stadium. Visit THE BLUE, one of the most visited sites in Idaho, and take a photo from the view of our Hall of Fame patio, one of the most popular selfie spots in the state, while learning more about the history of Boise State Athletics. You can see THE BLUE Monday through Friday from 10 am – 4 pm.* Metered Parking available in the west lot in front of the Bronco Shop.

                "content": "Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown (born June 4, 1997) is an American professional football wide receiver for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at College of the Canyons and Oklahoma and was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of the 2019 NFL draft. He has also played for the Arizona Cardinals. Brown was born on June 4, 1997, in Hollywood, Florida. He played Pop Warner football in the same Florida league with Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, though the two were on different teams.[1] Brown attended South Broward High School in Hollywood, where he also ran track. As an 11th grader Brown ran the 100 meters in a time of 11.53 seconds at the Florida High Schools Athletic Association's 4A District 13 regional championship track meet.[2] He transferred to Chaminade-Madonna College Preparatory School where in addition to playing football he also ran track, improving his 100-meter time to 10.90 seconds and posting a personal-best time of 21.94 seconds in the 200 meters at the Florida High Schools Athletic Association's 2A District 15 regional championship track meet.[3][4][5] After not receiving any scholarships from Division 1 schools, Brown signed with the College of the Canyons for the 2016 season. Because California Junior colleges do not offer sports scholarships, Brown worked at Six Flags Magic Mountain to make ends meet.[6] After a year at College of the Canyons, Brown received several Division 1 scholarship offers, committing to Oklahoma.[7] During his first year at Oklahoma, Brown played all thirteen games, starting eight, and had a team high 1,095 receiving yards, becoming the 8th all time receiver in single season yards. He also posted 265 yards against Oklahoma State, an Oklahoma record for receiving yards in a single game.[8] On January 2, 2019, Brown announced that he would forgo his final year of eligibility to declare for the 2019 NFL draft.[9] Brown was selected 25th overall by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of the 2019 NFL Draft.[10] He was the first wide receiver selected.[11][12][13] He signed his rookie contract on June 7, 2019.[14] Brown made his regular season debut against the Miami Dolphins in Week 1, recording four receptions, 147 receiving yards and two touchdowns.[15] Despite playing only 14 snaps, Brown became the first player in NFL history to score two touchdowns of 40 yards or more in his first game.[16] Brown caught eight passes for 86 yards in a Week 2 win against the Arizona Cardinals. Brown missed Weeks 6 and 7 due to injury.[17] In Week 12 against the Los Angeles Rams, Brown caught five passes for 42 yards and two touchdowns in a 45–6 win.[18] In Week 15, Brown caught his seventh touchdown in a 42–21 win over the New York Jets, which tied the Ravens franchise record for most receiving touchdowns by a rookie.[19] Brown finished 2019 as the Ravens' second leading receiver behind tight end Mark Andrews.[20] In his playoff debut, Brown led both teams with seven catches for 126 receiving yards in a 12–28 Divisional Round loss to the Tennessee Titans.[21] Brown recorded five receptions for 101 receiving yards in the 38–6 victory over the Cleveland Browns in Week 1.[22] In Week 8 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Brown recorded one catch for a three yard touchdown during the 24–28 loss.[23] After the game, Brown posted a later deleted tweet saying \"What's the point of having souljas when you never use them (Never!!)\" due to his lack of involvement in the Ravens' offense.[24] In Week 12 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Brown recorded 4 catches for 85 yards, including a 70 yard touchdown reception from Trace McSorley, during the 14–19 loss.[25] In Week 14 against the Browns, he had three drops, but also had a game-saving 44-yard touchdown reception on 4th and 5 with 1:51 left in the game. He finished the game with two catches for 50 yards as the Ravens won 47–42.[26] He was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the team on December 16, 2020,[27] and activated three days later.[28] Brown finished the regular season with 58 receptions for 769 yards and eight touchdowns.[29] In the AFC Wild Card Round against the Titans, Brown had seven receptions for 109 yards as the Ravens won 20–13.[30] In 2021, Brown changed his jersey number from #15 to #5 following a change of the NFL's jersey number rules.[31][32] In Week 2 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Brown had six receptions for 113 yards and a touchdown. It was his third 100-yard regular season game of his career and his first since Week 1 of the 2020 season. The Ravens would rally to win the game 36–35.[33] In Week 5 against the Indianapolis Colts, Brown caught a career-high nine receptions for 125 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-winner, as the Ravens again rallied to win in overtime 31–25.[34] In the 2021 season, Brown had 91 receptions for 1,008 receiving yards and six receiving touchdowns.[35] On April 28, 2022, on Day 1 of the 2022 NFL draft, Brown and the Ravens' third-round pick were traded to the Cardinals for the 23rd pick in the first round.[36] Brown said he was unhappy with the Ravens' offensive system and had asked to be traded.[37] The trade also reunited Brown with his college quarterback Kyler Murray.

                "content": "Hey, we're free to read into this whatever we want. When it comes to Hollywood Brown, we're choosing hope. We've been choosing hope for quite some time now. Ever since the Chiefs convinced Brown to sign on the dotted line (is it really dotted?) back in the spring as a free agent wide receiver signing a one-year deal, we've been filled with hope for what the veteran pass catcher would bring to the Chiefs offense. On Tuesday, Brown decided to post something to social media but instead of choosing clarity, he went with the ol' cryptic athlete angle. The only thing given to fans on Tuesday afternoon was a clock emoji and it was an old-fashioned alarm clock at that. ⏰ So what does this mean? Well, we're hoping (there's that word again) that it means \"time\" as in \"it's almost time\" as in \"it's almost time to welcome Hollywood back to the field\" as in \"it's almost time to welcome Hollywood Brown back to the field after suffering a sternoclavicular injury on the first play of the preseason.\" Yes, that's right, after months of dreaming of the pairing of Brown with Patrick Mahomes, of watching the two build offseason chemistry with private workouts of their own, of watching the trust and timing develop on the field at OTAs, the football gods frowned on the Chiefs offense and dealt Brown an injury on his very first catch in the preseason. It was ridiculous. It was unfair. After sitting out the first couple of weeks, the Chiefs eventually put Brown on injured reserve when it was clear he needed surgery and significant time to heal. This clavicle injury was worse than the one suffered by Tyreek Hill a few years before, where only. a handful of games were missed. In the ensuing weeks, it's been rumored that Brown could return by season's end instead of just forgetting about him completely. Those rumors typically focus on a potential playoff push for the Chiefs, but Brown is now posting in mid-November. Perhaps this insinuates something is soon or that he's anxious to return. Then again, it's also possible that Brown loves clocks or that it's time to wake up or that he simply sat on his phone wrong. My mom has literally called me twice this week saying both times that it was clicking the wrong button on her phone. But we choose hope on this day, hope that the Chiefs might just have themselves someone to stretch the field in all the ways we pictured six months ago before our hearts were broken by so many injuries. © 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Kansas City Chiefs find themselves AFC West champions and atop the AFC at 12-1 on the season entering Week 15. As they gear up for the final four weeks of the regular season, they could soon get a boost on offense. On Friday, the team is opening the practice window for wide receiver Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown, according to the MMQB. This comes after NFL Media reported that Brown had received final clearance to begin practicing, which paves the way for the wideout to play before the end of the regular season. With the practice window open, the Chiefs will have 21 days to move Brown onto the active roster, or he'll revert to injured reserve for the remainder of the season. Brown has been on injured reserve throughout the regular season after dislocating the sternoclavicular joint in his shoulder. The injury occurred on the opening drive of Kansas City's preseason opener this summer as Brown hauled in an 11-yard reception on the play he was injured. As the NFL Media report noted, Brown was in Colorado on Thursday, meeting with his surgeon, and received positive news. These latest updates jive with what CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reported in late November. At the time, Jones relayed that it's possible Brown could be back on the field in time for Kansas City's Christmas Day matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers. \"He's getting close,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid told reporters of Brown's status on Wednesday, via Chiefs Wire. \"He's chomping at the bit to get back out there, but he's got to visit with the doctor to make sure he gets clearance there.\" Brown, a 2019 first-round pick of the Baltimore Ravens, signed a one-year deal with the Chiefs back in March after spending the previous two seasons with the Arizona Cardinals. At the time he signed on, the 27-year-old was expected to give the defending Super Bowl champions a speedy deep threat to help stretch the offense. While they didn't get that for most of the regular season, Brown could help jolt the offense as they look to make another deep run this postseason. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs The team's doctors have cleared the star receiver to return to practice. Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown is poised for a dramatic comeback. After nearly four months recovering from a shoulder injury, the star receiver is reportedly ready to return just as Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs prepare for a crucial stretch in the season. The Chiefs, while maintaining an impressive record, have faced challenges this season, particularly with injuries to key players like Brown, running back Isiah Pacheco, and receiver Rashee Rice. Their absence has tested the depth of Kansas City's offense. Fortunately, the tides are turning. Pacheco has already returned to action, and now all eyes are on Brown, whose imminent comeback could reinvigorate the Chiefs' aerial attack and bolster their confidence ahead of the playoffs. Related: The Chiefs announced that their medical staff cleared Brown to return to practice on Monday. He has been designated to come off injured reserve and was listed as a limited participant in Friday's session. NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported that Brown is expected to complete his recovery by Saturday. While this timeline ruled him out for Week 15 against the Cleveland Browns, Rapoport confirmed that Brown should make his on-field return in Week 16 against the Houston Texans. Brown signed a one-year, $7 million deal in the offseason to strengthen the Chiefs' receiving corps, which had leaned heavily on veteran tight end Travis Kelce in 2023. His return comes at a pivotal moment as Kansas City eyes postseason dominance. The Chiefs face a challenging close to their regular season. In Week 16, they host the Texans, leaders of the AFC South. Week 17 takes them to Pittsburgh to battle the AFC North-leading Steelers, and they close the season against divisional rivals, the Denver Broncos. While Kansas City has already clinched the AFC West, securing the top seed in the AFC-and home-field advantage in the playoffs-is still at stake. Hollywood Brown's return could be the early Christmas miracle the Chiefs need to solidify their path to the Super Bowl. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

                "content": "The North Dakota State Bison football program represents North Dakota State University in college football at the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision level and competes in the Missouri Valley Football Conference. The Bison play in the 19,000-seat Fargodome located in Fargo. The Bison have won 17 national championships and 37 conference championships. They have won nine NCAA Division I AA FCS National Championships between 2011 and 2021. The Bison hold the record for most overall NCAA national championships and the record for the most consecutive championships with five titles between 2011 and 2015 for Division I FCS. Since 2011, the North Dakota State Bison have a record of 149–12 (.925) which included a record 22-game playoff win streak, making them the most successful college football program in Division I FCS this decade. The Bison are 202–39 (.838) since moving to Division I in 2004. Since 1964, the Bison have had only three losing seasons and an overall record of 551–136–4 (.800) through that 58-year span, one of the best in all of college football. Among FCS programs, North Dakota State has more all-time program wins than any non-Ivy League program, over 750. Of all teams established after 1894, only Oklahoma has won a higher percentage of its games than NDSU. The team also holds the record for the longest winning streak in the Football Championship Subdivision, which stands at 39 consecutive games spanning from 2017 to 2021.[4] In the final AP Football Poll of the 2013–14 season; after their third consecutive National Championship, North Dakota State finished with 17 votes which ranked them at #29 in all of D-I football, the highest end-of-season ranking of any team in the history of FCS football. After defeating 13th-ranked (FBS) Iowa in 2016, the Bison earned 74 votes and a #27 ranking in the entire D-I field, overtaking their previous record to become the highest-ranked FCS team of all time.[5] Collectively, the Bison have won 37 conference championships, and 17 national championships. They were selected as NCAA College Division II champions by polling three times (1965, 1968, 1969), won the NCAA Division II National Football Championship five times (1983, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1990), and have won the NCAA Division I Football Championship nine times in eleven seasons (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021).[6] The 2019 Bison are the first of any Division I team since 1894 Yale to finish 16–0. From 2012 to 2014, the Bison had a formerly FCS record of 33 straight wins (which is tied for the third longest in modern NCAA history). They subsequently had a 39-game winning streak that ran from 2017 to 2020.[7] The Bison fielded their first team in 1894 and were originally known as the NDAC Farmers.[8] From the early 1900s to 1921, the nickname of the school then known as North Dakota Agricultural College was the Aggies. The first coach for the new NDAC football team was Henry Bolley, who also fielded the first football program at Purdue University in 1887 and was their first Quarterback. He challenged the University of North Dakota to a football match in 1890, but did not have enough players until 1894, the first official year of football at NDSU. In 1902, Eddie Cochems, known as the father of the forward pass was hired as head coach of the Bison where he experimented building an offense around his new technique; which subsequently became legal in the 1906 college football season; Cochems went 9–1 in his two-year stint as head coach. The college hired famed Michigan halfback Paul Magoffin, the first player to ever catch a forward pass in 1907, as head coach, but he left for the head coaching position offered to him by George Washington University a year later. The 1918 season was canceled due to the outbreak of the Spanish Flu in conjunction with the first World War. The 1943 and 1944 seasons were also canceled due to World War II and the shortage of eligible players. Keeping with their Michigan favoritism, the NDAC hired Stanley Borleske in 1919 to coach the football, basketball, and baseball teams. After six years of on and off coaching. and a 36–36–7 record, Borleske left for Fresno State but is largely credited with developing the Bison mascot. It was well known he was not a fan of the \"Aggies\" mascot, wanting something 'strong and fierce' he came up with the 'Bison' which remains the mascot today. He also coined the term \"Thundering Herd\" which is still a common reference to the NDSU Bison Football fanbase.[8] In 1921, NDSU became a charter member of the now-defunct North Central Conference, which they remained affiliated with for 82 years until 2003. Their primary rival during this time were the University of North Dakota Fighting Sioux (now the Fighting Hawks) whom they competed with to win the Nickel Trophy. As members of Division II, they won 8 national championships with an overall record of 347–94–4 having only two losing seasons from 1964 to 2003. In 2004, all North Dakota State athletic teams moved to Division I. From 2004 to 2007, the Bison were members of the Great West Football Conference. Since 2008 they have been affiliated with the Missouri Valley Football Conference. Since moving to Division I, their primary rival are the South Dakota State University Jackrabbits whom they compete with each year for the Dakota Marker. The team's former head coach was Craig Bohl, who led the Bison from 2003 to 2013, holds the school record for most wins by a head coach, going 104–32 in his tenure at NDSU. Bohl's successor Chris Klieman went 69–6 in his five seasons (2014–2018). During the Bison's successful run to the 2018 FCS title, Klieman was named as the successor to the retiring Bill Snyder as head coach at Kansas State, though both schools agreed that Klieman would remain at NDSU while the Bison were involved in the FCS playoffs. Bison defensive coordinator Matt Entz took over as head coach following that season's championship game.[9] The NDSU Bison are the only FCS program to ever be ranked higher than #34 in the AP National Football Poll. After the 2011 championship game, the Bison became only the third team in FCS history to receive votes in the final AP Top 25 with 2, putting them at #32 overall (FCS Record); the others being Appalachian State who receive 5 votes after their third consecutive FCS Championship in 2007 and ended at #34 and James Madison University after their 2010 upset of then #13 Virginia Tech.[10] After the 2012 season, the Bison again broke the barrier and became the first-ever FCS team to breach the poll twice by receiving 1 vote and ending at #36 in the nation. Due to the overwhelming support and attention NDSU got during this run, ESPN announced that it would host its ESPN College GameDay program in downtown Fargo on September 21, 2013. The Bison ended up beating Delaware State 51–0 later that day. The Bison finished the 2013 regular season with an undefeated 11–0 record, their first perfect season since 1990. The Bison became the first FCS team to ever finish the regular season ranked on the AP Poll at #34 with 1 vote. The 2013 team also had a perfect 15–0 season, becoming the first program to do that since Marshall in 1996. They won their third consecutive national championship, tying an FCS record. A majority of the starters played in all 3 national championship games and went 43–2 in their three-year stint, a number unrivaled in Division I FCS football. The Bison only lost 2 games in the three-year span by a combined 6 points. After the 2013 season, the Bison were ranked #29 in the National Division I AP Poll, tallying a massive 17 votes, far beyond what any other FCS team had ever received. They later outdid themselves when they defeated Iowa in 2016, putting the Bison 27th in the AP Poll with 74 votes, the highest ranking of any team in FCS history. Through 2013, the Bison outscored their opponents by a combined 581–169 (+412) on the season. Only two other teams in FCS history have had a larger point spread through a season, 1996 Marshall (+448) and 1999 Georgia Southern (+485). Unlike the Marshall and Georgia Southern teams, NDSU's defense held their opponents to just 127 points in the regular season (11.5 ppg) and just 11 points on average through the playoffs that year. NDSU won its playoff games with an average margin of victory of 32.75 points, which just falls behind the 1996 Marshall team, which averaged a 34-point spread. In 2013, the Bison tallied three shutouts, and held nine teams to 10 points or less, including a streak of nine consecutive quarters without allowing a point. The offense was known for a ground-and-pound strategy, which wore opponents down and controlled the time of possession. The team averaged over 34 minutes of possession per game, while allowing an average of just 250 yards of opposing offense. In the 12 playoff games they played from 2011 to 2013, they allowed an average of 9.3 points per game, an FCS record. The only playoff loss the seniors experienced in their four-year career was the 38–31 overtime loss at eventual champion Eastern Washington in 2010 in the FCS quarterfinals. The span of seasons that followed for NDSU in the years after that overtime loss are easily the best and most dominant years Division I football has seen from a single team.[11] After the 2013 season, following three consecutive national titles Head Coach Craig Bohl was hired away to lead the Mountain West's Wyoming Cowboys.[12] Bohl finished his time at NDSU having successfully transitioned the program from Division II to Division I and built into the premier FCS powerhouse in the nation that continues today.[13] He finished at NDSU with a career record of 104–32. Following Bohl's departure, defensive coordinator Chris Klieman was promoted to head coach. In 2014, after beating their 5th consecutive FBS team, Iowa State, and their subsequent game against Weber State; which was their 26th straight victory, ESPN again announced they would bring College GameDay back to downtown Fargo on September 13, 2014 to cover the Bison's amazing run for the second straight year. The visit marked first time the show has ever visited the same FCS school twice and only the sixth time they have visited a non-FBS school since 1993. The Bison won an FCS record 33 straight games from 2012 to 2014, which is also the third longest in the history of Division I NCAA football. From 2010 to 2014, the Bison did not lose a single road game, a span of 22 games. They also had a winning streak of 26 home games (2012–2015) and have a record streak of 22 wins in the FCS playoffs. The Bison have won 16 straight home openers since their 1999 loss to Ferris State and are 21–1 in home openers since the Fargodome opened in 1992. 2015 would start with a surprise loss to #13 Montana broadcast nationally on ESPN; however, the season would extend both the MVFC run and National Championship run to five consecutive titles culminating in a 37–10 national title game against Jacksonville State. After this season, quarterback Carson Wentz was selected second overall by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2016 NFL draft. 2016 brought about one of the high points in Bison football history when, in week three, NDSU defeated #13 ranked Iowa on the road. Despite the impressive win, 2016 would be the worst season for the team since 2010. Not only would the team have the fewest wins since 2010 (12), they also lost the Dakota Marker for the first time since 2009. Ultimately the season would bring about the end of the Bison's historic title run with a semifinal loss against the eventual champion James Madison Dukes. 2017 would be a return to form for NDSU, only two games all season were decided by one possession, the best mark since the 2013 season. On December 15, NDSU became the only team in FCS history to make 7 consecutive semifinal appearances in the playoffs. In the title match the Bison would get revenge for the previous season defeating James Madison 17–13 in Frisco. The 2018 season would arguably top the 2013 season as the best in school history. NDSU went 15–0 for the second time in school history and had only one game all season decided by less than one touchdown (the Dakota Marker match up against #3 South Dakota State). NDSU captured their seventh title in eight years, defeating Eastern Washington 38-24 on January 9, 2019.[14] It was also Chris Klieman's fourth title in five years. The 2018 Bison defeated opponents by an average score of 41.5 – 12.6, good for a score differential of 28.9 points. The season saw quarterback Easton Stick finish his college career with a record of 49–3, the highest win total for any quarterback in FCS history.[15] Right before the semifinal matchup against South Dakota State Klieman was hired by former Bison athletic director Gene Taylor to lead the Kansas State Wildcats, he was allowed to finish the season with NDSU. On March 4, 2019, President Donald Trump hosted the NDSU football team at the White House. They were served fast food, as was FBS champion Clemson.[16] Easton Stick presented a number 45 NDSU football jersey to Trump.[17] The visit was orchestrated by Senator John Hoeven.[18] On December 13, 2018, NDSU announced defensive coordinator Matt Entz would replace Chris Klieman as head coach.[19] The Bison started the 2019 season with 57–10 victory over Butler in front of record-breaking \"home\" crowd of 34,544 at Minneapolis's Target Field. 2019 saw the first game against in-state rival North Dakota since 2015. The Bison were victorious over the Fighting Hawks 38–7 in front of the largest Fargodome crowd (18,923) since NDSU hosted Northern Iowa for Homecoming in 2015 (18,954).[20] On October 20, 2019, it was announced that ESPN would be bringing their College GameDay program to Brookings, South Dakota to cover the Dakota Marker featuring #3 South Dakota State and #1 North Dakota State. The Bison defeated SDSU 23–16. On January 11, 2020, NDSU won another FCS title after defeating James Madison University 28–20, and also became the first Division I team since 1894 Yale to finish 16–0, their second undefeated season in a row.[7][21] On May 2, 2021, the NDSU Bison, under Entz, ended a three-championship win streak by losing 24–20 to Sam Houston State University in the quarterfinals of the 2020 FCS playoffs. This is the first time since 2010 that the NDSU Bison did not make the semifinals.[22] On May 13, 2021, former Bison QB Trey Lance was drafted with the 3rd overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft by the San Francisco 49ers after leaving the team before the Spring season began.[23] On October 2, 2021, the NDSU Bison played in-state rival North Dakota (UND) in Grand Forks for the first time since 2003, with NDSU and UND, respectively, ranked 5th and 10th at the time. The Bison won this matchup, 16–10.[24] On November 6, 2021, the 22nd edition of the battle for the Dakota Marker ended with a SDSU victory, 27–19.[25] NDSU was ranked 2nd at the time and SDSU ranked 9th. This marked the first time SDSU had won multiple games in a row in the Marker series since 2016–17 when the Jacks won back-to-back marker games against the Bison. On January 8, 2022, the Bison played the Montana State Bobcats for the FCS championship. They ended up winning, 38–10, as FB Hunter Luepke ran for three touchdowns in the first half. On January 8, 2023, the Bison lost the 2023 NCAA Division I Football Championship Game to rival South Dakota State, 21–45. This was NDSU's first loss in a Division I championship game, and only their third at any level.[26] On September 2, 2023, the Bison hosted Eastern Washington in Minneapolis, Minnesota for the first ever college football game to be played at US Bank Stadium. NDSU would go on to win the game, 35–10.[27] On October 15, 2023, the Bison fell to their in-state rival UND for the first time in over two decades. [28] The 2023 season was the first fall season since 2010 that the Bison were unseeded heading in to the playoffs. They then became just the fourth unseeded team to reach the FCS semifinals since the playoffs added byes. On December 10, 2023, North Dakota State announced that Entz would be leaving Fargo for the vacant USC linebackers position coach job. He was allowed to finish the 2023 playoff run at NDSU.[29] The Bison would fall at Montana later in the week in double overtime. On December 17, 2023, North Dakota State announced that Wyoming offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Tim Polasek would take over as the next head coach of the Bison.[30] Polasek had previously coached for the team from 2006–12 and 2014–16. On October 19, 2024, the Bison defeated the top-ranked, arch-rival, South Dakota State Jackrabbits to reclaim the Dakota Marker for the first time since 2019.[31] This ended NDSU's losing streak to SDSU, as well as protected their Missouri Valley Football Conference league game winning streak record at 19. On November 23, 2024, the Bison fell to fellow Dakota school, South Dakota, in consecutive regular seasons for the first time in the Division I era.[32] North Dakota State have won 17 national championships: three as a member of the College Division (precursor of Division II), five as a member of Division II, and nine as a member of Division I FCS. The Bison have been the runner-up four times (1967, 1981, 1984, and 2022) and have appeared in a total of 20 national championship games. North Dakota State has won 35 conference championships, 24 outright and 13 shared; North Central Conference (26), Great West (1), Missouri Valley (11) † Co-champions (2004–present) North Dakota State has appeared in a total of 15 NCAA Division I Football Championship playoffs, all of which have been consecutive. The Bison have an overall record of 49–5 in postseason play since becoming eligible in 2008, including a record streak of 22 consecutive playoff wins from 2011 to 2016. The Bison have won more Division I FCS playoff games than any other program (past or present). NDSU has won 9 national championship games, lost 1 and have advanced to the quarterfinal round in every playoff they have appeared in. Every playoff game NDSU has lost (5) has been to the eventual national champion that year, excluding 2023 in which Montana went on to fall to South Dakota State in the title game. Montana State (1964–2003) North Dakota State appeared in 23 NCAA Division II playoffs from 1964 to 2003. During this stretch NDSU compiled a 347–94–4 record winning almost 80% of their games for four decades and claiming eight championships along the way. NDSU appeared in seven out of ten championship games from 1981 to 1990; including appearing in four straight championship games, an unrivaled number in D-II as they posted a 111–16–2 (.875) mark from 1981 to 1990. While this is a startling record, from 1964 to 1973 the Bison went 90–12–1 (.887) which included a 35-game unbeaten streak. The Bison are 25–16 against Northern Iowa (UNI) all time.[33] Both Chris Klieman and Matt Entz spend time on the UNI defensive staff before getting hired away to NDSU. Kleiman, in particular, played football at Northern Iowa and spent two separate stints on the Panther coaching staff. The two schools played every season from 1954 to 1979 as members of the North Central Conference. The schools were reunited in 2008 when NDSU moved to the Missouri Valley Football Conference. Northern Iowa won the first three battles, with the 2009 edition marked by a sideline fight between the two sides.[34] In the early 2010s North Dakota State–UNI was regularly one of the highest-profile games of the season, and the two considered each other to be top rivals.[35] In 2011 the #3 ranked Bison hosted #2 UNI in front of a near-capacity crowd of 18,886. The herd won the matchup 27–19 in a game sometimes regarded as the start of the NDSU dynasty. Two seasons later NDSU would again host UNI in a top-five matchup, the Herd won the game by a narrow margin of 24–23, by far the closest matchup of the 2013 season. The following year the Panthers would be the team to end NDSU's record-breaking 33-game winning streak, thoroughly thrashing the three-time defending champions 23–3. The 2015 edition of the rivalry was one of the most interesting in the series, and is considered one of the greatest games in NDSU history. The game was announced as homecoming before the season, the day started with SportsCenter's \"On the Road Show\" broadcasting live from the Fargodome. The #3 Bison trailed nearly all game before Carson Wentz hit future Green Bay Packers receiver Darrius Shepherd (who didn't play most of the first half due to injury) in the endzone for the game-winning touchdown with less than a minute remaining.[36] Recently the rivalry has cooled as the Bison have won six straight in the series, with the 2018 and 2019 edition being won by a combined score of 102–45.[37] Tim Polasek is the 32nd and current head coach of the Bison, and he takes over after the team lost to Montana in the semifinals of the 2023 FCS playoffs. He succeeded Matt Entz, who was named to the open Linebackers/Assistant Coach position at USC.[38] Entz concluded his five seasons as head coach (2019–2023) with a 60–11 record and two FCS national championships, as well as two MVFC titles. Craig Bohl holds the record for most wins in school history with 104 in his 11-year career averaging over 9.5 wins per season. Ron Erhardt holds the record for most conference titles won with 6, followed by Rocky Hager and Chris Klieman with 5 each. The Bison have played in the Fargodome since it opened in 1993. It holds 18,700 for football games and over 19,000 including standing room only tickets, making it the largest stadium in Fargo. The record attendance at the Fargodome is 19,108 when the Bison played Missouri State on October 12, 2013. The Bison have only lost one playoff game in the history of the Fargodome. The tremendous crowd noise caused by the Fargodome's steel roof disrupts many opposing offenses and creates one of the best home field advantages in college football Football records in the Fargodome In 2011, the Fargodome was ranked as the 49th-best stadium in all of college football.[39] The article cites, \"There aren't many indoor venues in college football, but the few that do exist at the non-FBS level are very unfriendly to any visiting team. That effect is only amplified in a playoff atmosphere.\" The Fargodome is routinely ranked as one of the loudest college football stadiums in the country. In 2016, Stadium Journey ranked the Fargodome as the #2 Best FCS stadium to experience a game in[40] On December 10, 2011 in a game against Lehigh, the crowd noise was measured at 111 decibels, comparable to when the New Orleans Saints play in the Superdome. During the 2011 playoffs, the decibel level spiked past 130 decibels several times but was not an official measurement.[41][42] On December 14, 2012 in an FCS semifinal game against Georgia Southern, the crowd noise exceeded the 115-decibel mark and was known to be one of the loudest games in NDSU history. The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead conducted an informal study of Fargodome crowd noise from the press box during a playoff semifinal game, December 2013. The readings showed a high of 111 decibels following a late touchdown by quarterback Brock Jensen. The decibel meter consistently read 102–106 throughout that game, according to The Forum. NDSU to study decibel levels at playoff football game During the 2013 Furman playoff game, the crowd noise was measured at 115 decibels.[43] During the 2015 playoffs against Montana, the crowd noise measured 120 decibels, the Bison beat the Grizzlies 37–6, avenging their season-opening loss in Missoula. The record for the loudest indoor stadium crowd was set in 2013 at the Sacramento Kings' former home of Sleep Train Arena at 126 decibels. Due to the notorious noise, the Fargodome is sometimes referred to as the \"Thunderdome\". An example of this loudness can be found when the Bison offense advances the ball and gets a \"first down\". The announcer says over the loud speaker, \"With that carry/pass, thats another Bison\", in which the crowd loudly responds in unison \"FIRST DOWN...AH MOVE THE CHAINS\". Although an announcer declaring a \"first down\" is not unique to the Fargodome, the audience's response along with the prompt to move the chains is fairly unique to the Fargodome. This tradition was started back in the days when the team played in Dacotah Field. The crowd would do the traditional chant after every Bison first down and it was carried over to the FargoDome when the team played its first game in the new facility. Prior to the Fargodome, the team played at Dacotah Field from 1910 to 1992, an outdoor stadium dealing with the very harsh winters in Fargo. The following is table of all the games North Dakota State has played against a Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) school since they began reclassification to become a FCS school. The list below covers North Dakota State All-Americans since the 2004 season when the program joined the FCS. This list uses six total selectors, the Associated Press (AP), STATS FCS (once they began coverage in 2015), HERO sports (once they began coverage in 2016 and stopped in 2023), TSN (who began FCS coverage in 2006 and stopped in 2014), the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), and the Athletic Directors Association (ADA).[62] This list is in progress. Announced schedules as of August 8, 2023.[63][64][65]",
