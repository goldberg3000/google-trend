He quickly joined the Nationals’ Dominican Academy and immediately began to immerse himself in English by using the Rosetta Stone language-learning software lessons. Soto initially practiced English for one hour a day, five days a week. After the Dominican Academy, Soto joined the Nationals’ Class A affiliate, the Hagerstown Suns. He met Suns catcher Tres Barrera, who was born in Texas to Mexican parents. Soto told Barrera that he only wanted the two of them to converse in English. Barrera told the Washington Post that he remembered how Soto would go to a McDonald’s near the Hagerstown ballpark every day to practice his English by ordering from the menu. When Soto was called up to the Nationals, he told manager Dave Martinez, “No Spanish, only English.” Soto himself also recalled the role that his mother played in his English lessons. “I remember her telling me that if I wanted to be a star, I had to know the language in the country I wanted to play in,” he reflected. “She was right.

                "title": "Juan Soto: Nationals outfielder, mastering English in addition to MLB",
                "content": "WASHINGTON — Juan Soto figures he was probably 12 years old when he returned home one day, after completing three levels of English courses, and told his mom he was done. He didn't want to learn the new language anymore. He didn't need to learn it anymore. \"She tells me if I want to be a baseball player, I have to learn,\" Soto recalled. \"I said, ‘No, I just have to play baseball.'\" But as Soto kept just playing baseball, his perspective changed. The Washington Nationals signed him to a contract in 2015 and gave him a $1.5-million signing bonus. They shipped the then-16-year-old Dominican outfielder to their academy in Boca Chica, a complex about an hour east of his hometown of Santo Domingo and a few miles from the beach. He started to think of English not as a chore, but as another skill to be mastered on his way to the big leagues. \"If you want to be a superstar,\" Soto told USA TODAY Sports, \"you’ve got to be ready in every spot.\" All things Nationals: Latest Washington Nationals news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more. Soto, now 20, has emerged as one of baseball's bright young stars over the past year – and one of the main reasons the Nationals felt comfortable letting Bryce Harper walk in free agency. But beyond his patience at the plate and ability to crush fastballs, he has most impressed teammates and staff with the dedication he's put into English – not just learning the language, but perfecting it. \"He was first to graduate at the (Dominican) academy, speaking English,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez told USA TODAY Sports. \"He’s very adamant about fitting in and being a part of this culture, as well as back at home.\" According to statistics provided by MLB, more than 25 percent of players on Opening Day rosters this season hailed from Spanish-speaking countries, including more than 100 players from the Dominican Republic alone. Some players prefer to stick to their native tongues. Others work to pick up conversational English, to better communicate with their teammates and fans. Few pick it up as quickly as Soto has. \"It’s tough, definitely. It’s really tough,\" said Venezuelan-born pitcher Anibal Sanchez, who explained that he spoke zero English when he first joined the Boston Red Sox organization in 2001. \"When I came to the U.S., as soon as I got out of the plane, they asked me where I was from. And the answer was my name. The guy started laughing at me, but it is what it is at that point.\" Sanchez said he's taken online classes with a private teacher even in recent years to improve his English. For Soto, the process really started when he signed with the team less than four years ago – though he admits he did have a slight head start, thanks to his mom. When he arrived in Boca Chica, the staff gave Soto a log-in for Rosetta Stone and required him, like other prospects at the academy, to study English for at least one hour a day, five days per week. Soto met that daily requirement – and then some. \"Everybody goes to sleep and all this stuff, and I stayed awake and said ‘oh, let’s do some English,'\" Soto said. \"I started working. I (did) like two hours, one (more) hour every day. That’s why I finished really fast.\" The following year, when Soto graduated to the Gulf Coast League – the lowest rung of the minors – he used it as an opportunity to pick up more real-world experience. He spoke with his American teammates often, and found a safe learning space at a nearby McDonald's, where employees didn't judge him for saying the incorrect word or phrase. Soto became so articulate so quickly that by the time the Nationals called him up last spring, at 19, he was already able to conduct interviews in English. \"I didn’t even know we’ve got to talk with the media every day. So I was like… Wow,\" Soto said with a smile. \"I was a little nervous, but every word I said, I was like ‘Oh, I can do it in English.’ So I started doing it in English since the first day.\" Octavio Martinez, the Nationals' translator, flanked Soto during interviews with reporters when he was called up. And he's still on hand now, in case Soto misses a word or doesn't understand a question. But Martinez said he's rarely needed. \"I’m definitely very impressed – the fact that at such a young age, he’s able to comprehend it so well,\" Martinez said. \"I think the biggest thing is just his confidence, which shows on the field. He’s so confident. It’s the same thing with him talking to the media – he’s confident in what he’s going to say.\" Now, even two months into his second big-league season, Soto is the fourth-youngest player in the majors. He finished second in National League Rookie of the Year voting last season and has already racked up six home runs and 22 RBI this year, despite spending the past eight days on the injured list with back spasms. (He is eligible to return Saturday.) Soto said he's still working on his English every day, mostly by talking with teammates. The language has become important to him on the field, and even more so beyond it. He wants to be able to communicate with reporters in interviews, but also feel comfortable interacting with fans who might approach him at a restaurant and ask for an autograph. \"You’ve got to be comfortable to talk with them, and they’ve got to be comfortable with you talking, to ask everything they want,\" Soto explained. \"That’s why (stars) are stars. They’re good in every spot.\" Contact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.",

                "title": "San Francisco 49ers 38, Chicago Bears 13: Grades",
                "content": "SANTA CLARA -- The San Francisco 49ers just kept their season alive with a 38-13 statement win over the Chicago Bears. Here are the 49ers' grades for this performance. One of the best performances of Brock Purdy's career. He hit 80 percent of his throws, completed passes to seven different receivers, threw for 325 yards and 2 touchdowns and posted a passer rating of 145.4. Finally, he stopped forcing passes to Deebo Samuel, who has been killing the 49ers' offense all season (more on him in a minute). Instead, Purdy threw six passes to George Kittle and eight passes to Jauan Jennings. Those are the two best receivers on the team and they should have been featured consistently this year. Last week, Kittle caught just one pass. Afterward, Purdy said his progressions didn't take him to Kittle. With all due respect, screw your progressions, Brock. Find your best players. And that's exactly what he did today. He's growing up. And now he has four more games to show he's worth a multi-year contract that will make him one of the highest-paid players in the NFL. No offense to Christian McCaffrey, but the 49ers are better without him this season. In four games with him, they averaged just 15 points per game. In 9 games without him, the 49ers are averaging 27.6 points per game. And that's because the 49ers get all of their playmakers involved when McCaffrey is out. Today, Isaac Guerendo started the first game of his career and scored two touchdowns. He also had a 30-yard run, a 27-yard catch and a 23-yard catch. He's a big play waiting to happen and he should have had a role in the offense all season. Unfortunately for the 49ers, he left the game with a foot injury after 15 carries. Perhaps he couldn't handle such a big work load. His replacement, Patrick Taylor Jr., gained just 25 yards on 7 carries. The 49ers need Guerendo to play this Thursday against the Rams. Two targets, one catch, three yards. But hey, at least he didn't fumble at the goal line like last week. Jauan Jennings was outstanding -- seven catches for 90 yards and 2 touchdowns. He deserves another contract extension. He already has outperformed the two-year deal the 49ers gave him this offseason. His counterpart, Deebo Samuel, was terrible once again -- three targets, two catches, 22 receiving yards plus five carries for a measly 13 rushing yards. The 49ers averaged just 4.4 yards per play when they handed the ball or threw it to Samuel, and a whopping 7.9 yards per play when they handed it or threw it to anyone else. The 49ers should have traded Samuel this past offseason. Instead, they restructured his contract in a way that will make him incredibly difficult to trade or release this coming offseason. Oops. One of the best games of George Kittle's career. He had six catches for 151 yards. Last week, he had one catch for 7 yards. Afterward, he told the media he hardly ran any routes and that he was open the few times he didn't have to block. Message received. Suddenly, Kyle Shanahan was calling all kinds of exotic screens and play-action passes for Kittle. Shanahan should do that every week. Kittle is the greatest tight end in franchise history and somehow he's still in his prime. They didn't block particularly well in the run game, but they didn't have Trent Williams, Aaron Banks or Ben Bartch and they still gave up just one sack. That's impressive. Yetur Gross-Matos sacked Caleb Williams three times, Leonard Floyd sacked him twice and Maliek Collins sacked him once. The 49ers needed these three to step up while Nick Bosa is out and they did. They held Bears running back D'Andre Swift to just 38 rushing yards and gave up zero rushing touchdowns. And next week, they most likely will get Dre Greenlaw back. Good news. They gave up two touchdown passes and a quarterback rating of 116.9, but they also gave up just 134 yards through the air. Plus Talanoa Hufanga returned from a wrist injury and the 49ers defense improved dramatically with him on the field. The 49ers need to find a way to re-sign him this offseason. He's the biggest playmaker in their secondary even when he's playing with just one hand. Jake Moody didn't miss any field goals but he kicked two kickoffs short of the 20-yard line, which is a penalty. He needs to go this offseason. Finally, Kyle Shanahan did the things we've been begging him to do all season: he stopped playing Kyle Juszczyk so much and instead mostly used one-back formations, he spread the ball around on offense and he called lots of screens and play-action passes which gave Brock Purdy plenty of easy throws. Where was this Kyle Shanahan all season? It seems like McCaffrey's knee injury may have brought the best out of Shanahan because he finally accepted that McCaffrey won't save him and the team this season and that he needs to build an offensive identity without him. And the offensive identity is a diverse, balanced attack featuring Kittle and Jennings, not Samuel and McCaffrey. If only Shanahan had this epiphany in September, the 49ers might not be 6-7. Now let's see if he can keep it up this Thursday against the Rams, who beat the Bills today. The Bears are sorry team that has lost seven games in a row while the Rams have won five of their past seven. The 49ers will need another a-plus performance from Shanahan to win.

                "title": "49ers Rout the Bears at Levi's® Stadium; Five Takeaways from #CHIvsSF",
                "content": "Team Reporter The San Francisco 49ers returned home after a couple of tough road games to host the Chicago Bears (4-8). For a third-straight week, the team was without a couple of key starters in defensive lineman Nick Bosa (hip/oblique) and left tackle Trent Williams (ankle), and Sunday marked back-to-back games without starting left guard Aaron Banks (concussion). Despite missing important personnel, the red and gold took control of this game early and never surrendered the lead, routing the Chicago Bears 38-13. Here are five takeaways from the Bears-49ers game: The Rookie Running Back Gets First-Career Start With both Christian McCaffrey and Jordan Mason landing on the Injured Reserve list in Week 14, rookie Isaac Guerendo was tasked with leading the 49ers ground game versus the Bears. San Francisco's fourth-rounder wasted no time making his presence known, hauling in a 23-yard catch on the opening drive and coming down with a 27-yard reception on the third drive to set up his own one-yard score on the next play. He punched in a second touchdown, a four-yarder to open up the fourth quarter and extend the lead 31-13. JJ Finds the End Zone First Wide receiver Jauan Jennings recorded the third multi-touchdown game of his career in Week 14. Jennings caught seven passes for 90 yards and two touchdowns on Sunday afternoon. His second target of the day was a seven-yard touchdown pass to the left corner of the end zone to cap off the 49ers five-play, 70-yard opening drive. To get the fans really hyped, Jennings celebrated with a Levi's® Leap (leaped into the crowd in the north end zone). He added another score midway through the second quarter, connecting with Purdy in the red zone for a 16-yard catch-and-run TD. He added a little Jennings flare by diving in for pay dirt. Defensive Line Breakdown Bears quarterback Caleb Williams entered Sunday as the most sacked QB in the league, and the 49ers defensive line added another four to the count in Week 14. Yetur Gross-Matos, Leonard Floyd and Maliek Collins all got home on Williams for a combined loss of 30 yards. The first four sacks of the day came on third downs and helped the 49ers defensive unit force three-and-outs on four of the Bears five offensive possessions in the first half. The D-line added another splash play in the third quarter when Evan Anderson recovered the ball that came out of Williams' hand behind the line of scrimmage. San Francisco was able to take over at their own 38-yard line, and Guerendo punched in a four-yard score on the ensuing drive. Gross-Matos struck again in the fourth quarter in back-to-back plays for a total loss of eight yards on the second to last of Chicago's offensive possessions. The People's Tight End Continues to Climb the Charts Tight end George Kittle finds himself in a new exclusive club after logging six catches for 151 yards against the Bears. It was actually following his third catch of the day, a 23-yarder to open up the second quarter that Kittle joined Hall of Fame tight end Antonio Gates and tight end Travis Kelce as the third tight end in NFL history to register 500-plus catches and 7,000-plus yards in his first eight seasons. His 151 yards on the day also made him San Francisco's current receiving yards leader. Injuries of the Game The San Francisco 49ers dropped their Week 13 matchup 35-10 to the Buffalo Bills. The San Francisco 49ers dropped their Week 12 matchup 38-10 to the Green Bay Packers. The San Francisco 49ers dropped their Week 11 matchup 20-17 to the Seattle Seahawks.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) After weeks of shaky play, the San Francisco 49ers got back to their old form with one of the most dominant first halves in years. Brock Purdy threw for 325 yards and two touchdowns and the 49ers bounced back from two blowout losses to beat Chicago 38-13 on Sunday and spoil interim coach Thomas Brown's debut for the Bears. “We just got back to being us, honestly,” linebacker Fred Warner said. “The product we were putting on the field the last couple weeks just wasn’t us. We knew that. We had a great opportunity this week to come out at home and right those wrongs and get back to playing our style and what we do best.” The 49ers (6-7) had been outscored by 53 points the past two weeks in losses at Green Bay and Buffalo that left their playoff hopes teetering with several stars such as Christian McCaffrey, Nick Bosa and Trent Williams sidelined by injuries. That prompted coach Kyle Shanahan to have Purdy and cornerback Deommodore Lenoir address the team at a meeting Saturday night that resonated with the team. “The message was we need to play with more of a sense of urgency and play desperate,” tight end George Kittle said. “Because you just hadn't really sensed that.” But San Francisco delivered a performance more reminiscent of a year ago when the Niners went to the Super Bowl, handing the Bears (4-9) their seventh straight loss after outgaining them by 315 yards on the way to a 24-0 halftime lead. Purdy delivered his third 300-yard passing game of the season with two TDs to Jauan Jennings, fill-in back Isaac Guerendo gained 128 yards from scrimmage and scored on two TD runs and Kittle had six catches for 151 yards. That helped deliver the highest-scoring game of the season for the 49ers. “I think we just all executed, did our job and kept it simple,” Purdy said. “I think guys weren’t overthinking anything. Just whatever was called we trusted in Kyle and executed.” The defense did the rest with strong pressure from the four-man line that led to rookie Caleb Williams getting sacked seven times. The Bears were looking for an emotional boost from the first in-season firing of a head coach in franchise history after letting Matt Eberflus go following a late-game clock mismanagement on Thanksgiving at Detroit. Instead they came up on the short end of one of the most lopsided first halves in recent memory. Chicago was outgained 319-4 in the first half for the ninth-largest discrepancy since 1991, managed only one first down and trailed by 24 points at the break. The Bears allowed Purdy and the San Francisco offense to move down the field with little resistance with the Niners scoring three TDs and one field goal on their first five possessions. Chicago couldn't move the ball at all on offense, generating minus-3 yards passing thanks to four sacks and losing 37 yards on five failed third down attempts. “We got our ass kicked today,” Williams said. “There’s no way around it. We got it handed to us. Offense, defense special teams, we have to come out and be better.\" Williams managed to throw two touchdown passes to Rome Odunze in the second half, but it was too late to get the Bears back into the game. Williams finished 17 for 34 for 134 yards and lost a fumble, but had his seventh straight start without an interception. Williams’ 56 sacks this season are the most for any Chicago quarterback since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. Bears: Returner DeAndre Carter (hamstring) left in the first quarter and didn't return. ... RB Travis Homer (head) left the game in the second half. 49ers: Guerendo left the game in the fourth quarter with a foot injury. Shanahan said the team would know more about the severity on Monday. ... LG Ben Bartch (high ankle sprain) left the game in the first half and didn't return. Bartch was starting in place of the injured Aaron Banks and the Niners were forced to use third-stringer Spencer Burford the rest of the way.

They're only two games out of first place in their division while the Bears are all but dead. They've lost six games in a row and just fired their head coach last week. They have every excuse to mail it in this week on the road. But I expect them to play harder than the 49ers. Every team plays harder than the 49ers season. Every week, they get pushed around in the trenches. And since 2020, they're 0-5 when both Nick Bosa and Trent Williams don't play. I expect the 49ers offense to struggle on the ground because Isaac Guerendo isn't built to carry a big workload. In the passing game, I expect Brock Purdy to continue to throw short passes and scramble -- his arm seems injured. And on defense, I expect the 49ers to continue to struggle to stop the run. Rookie quarterback Caleb Williams should be able to scramble whenever he wants. FINAL SCORE PREDICTION: 49ers 16, Bears 20. 1:23 The Bears win the coin toss and defer. The 49ers will receive the opening kickoff. 1:30 On 1st and goal from the 7, Brock Purdy completes a touchdown pass to Jauan Jennings running a crossing route toward the back left pylon. Earlier in the drive, Purdy completed a checkdown pass to Isaac Guerendo who ran for 23 yards, then Purdy completed a play-action screen pass to George Kittle who ran for 33 yards. Excellent opening script from Kyle Shanahan. 49ers 7, Bears 0. 1:36 On 3rd and 7 from the Bears 26, Caleb Williams completes a 4-yard pass to backup running back Travis Homer, and the Bears go 3 and out. The 49ers defense is flying to the football and tackling. Where has this team been all year? 1:46 On 3rd and 5 from the 49ers' 49, Brock Purdy gets hit as he throws an incomplete pass over the middle. Through two drives, Isaac Guerendo has just 9 rushing yards on 3 carries. After the punt, the Bears take over at their 6-yard line. 1:51 On 3rd and 10 from the Bears 18, Caleb Williams steps up in the pocket and moves right into Yetur Gross-Matos who records the sacks. After the punt, the 49ers take over at their 36. 1:52 49ers left guard Ben Bartch has an ankle injury and his return is questionable. His replacement is Spencer Burford. 1:57 On 2nd and 6 from the Bears 28, Purdy takes a hit as he throws deep off his back foot to Guerendo who makes a stumbling catch and gets tagged down at the 1-yard line. Then on the next plays he dives into the end zone for the touchdown. The 49ers are so much better without Christian McCaffrey this season because Kyle Shanahan actually spreads the ball around. 49ers 14, Bears 0. 2:03 On 3rd and 7 from the Bears 33, Leonard Floyd sacks Caleb Williams and the Bears go 3 and out. After the punt, the 49ers take over at their 29 with 5 seconds left in the first quarter. 2:20 On 3rd and 4 from the Bears 16, Purdy throws a touchdown pass to Jauan Jennings who ran a slant and was wide open. That was a 12-play drive that took 7:24 off the clock. George Kittle already has 106 receiving yards. The 49ers should have been featuring him like this all season. 49ers 21, Bears 0. 2:24 On 3rd and 5 from the Bears 35, Maliek Collins sacks Caleb Williams. Williams is incredibly indecisive and he hasn't scrambled yet. After the punt, the 49ers take over at their 26. 2:37 On 3rd and goal from the 10, Purdy scrambles for 5 yards, and the Jake Moody makes a 23-yard field goal with 1:50 left in the first half. 49ers 24, Bears 0. 2:44 On 3rd and 2 from the Bears 48, Leonard Floyd sacks Williams and the Bears go 3 and out again. Then they punt, Brock Purdy takes a knee and the first half ends. What a half for the 49ers. 3:11 On 3rd and goal from the 4, Charvarius Ward gives up a touchdown catch to Rome Odunze near the back pylon. Then the Bears go for 2, and tight end Cole Kmet drops a pass in the end zone. 49ers 24, Bears 6. 3:18 On 3rd and 8 from the 49ers' 32, Brock Purdy air mails a deep pass intended for Ricky Pearsall and the 49ers go 3 and out. They ran the ball one time during that series and gained 7 yards. Bad play calling. After the punt, the Bears take over at their 35. 3:29 On 2nd and 8 from the 49ers 30, the ball slips out of Williams' hand as he attempts to pump fake and Evan Anderson recovers at the 49ers 38. 3:37 On 1st and goal from the 4, Guerendo sprints up the middle untouched for his second touchdown of the game. Good thing the 49ers buried him during their 3-game losing streak. 49ers 31, Bears 6. 3:44 On 2nd and 7 from the 49ers 14, Ji'Ayir Brown gives up a touchdown catch to Rome Odunze. Brown is playing in place of Talanoa Hufanga because the game essentially is over. 49ers 31, Bears 13. 4:00 Isaac Guerendo has a foot injury and his return is questionable. 4:04 On second and goal from the 3, Patrick Taylor Jr. dives into the end zone for the touchdown. 49ers 38, Bears 13. 4:10 On 3rd and 10 from the Bears 30, Yetur Gross-Matos sacks Caleb Williams for the second time in this series and the Bears go 3 and out. After the punt, the 49ers take over at midfield. This game is over. Stay tuned for their grades. 4:13 Brandon Allen just threw an interception. Hilarious. Download and follow The Cohn Zohn Podcast.

Ones that have won playoff games, though admittedly not in a while. The longtime Pittsburgh Steelers defensive tackle, now well into his dotage in his 14th season, can't quite remember having a group like the one that he plays on now. “We have a complete team,” Heyward said. A team that began the season riddled with question marks now finds itself steamrolling toward Christmas with everything on the table. Russell Wilson threw for 158 yards and two touchdowns, Heyward recorded two sacks and the Steelers beat the Cleveland Browns 27-14 on Sunday even with leading receiver George Pickens watching from the sideline while missing the first game of his career due to a groin injury. While it took Wilson and the rest of the offense time to get going with the productive if volatile Pickens out of the mix, Wilson found his footing in the second half by connecting on touchdown passes to Pat Freiermuth and Van Jefferson as the Steelers (10-3) moved two games ahead of Baltimore for the AFC North lead with four weeks to go. Two weeks after a messy pratfall in the snow, Pittsburgh avoided being swept by the Browns for the first time since 1988 by taking advantage of the countless opportunities mistake-prone Cleveland (3-10) provided. Jameis Winston threw two interceptions, Dustin Hopkins missed two makeable field goals when the outcome was still in doubt and a series of ill-time flags added up to the Browns reaching double-digit losses for the 18th time since the franchise returned in 1999. “I don’t believe the Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Cleveland Browns,” Winston said. “I believe the Cleveland Browns beat the Cleveland Browns.” While Winston avoided the pick-6s that have dogged him throughout his career - including last week in Denver - but did little after hitting Jerry Jeudy for a 35-yard touchdown in the first quarter that gave the Browns an early lead. Winston finished 24 of 41 for 211 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. Nick Chubb ran for 48 yards in his return to Pittsburgh after a devastating knee injury on the same field 15 months ago forced him to miss more than a year. Yet the Steelers kept Myles Garrett relatively in check after the defensive star racked up three sacks in Cleveland's snowy upset on Nov. 21, and Pittsburgh's defense provided the spark that brought the offense to life. The surge began when Winston's screen pass intended for Chubb landed in the hands of 6-foot-4, 309-pound Steelers defensive tackle Keeanu Benton, who lugged his first career interception 11 yards. Najee Harris bulled over from 1 yard out five plays later to give the Steelers a lead they wouldn't relinquish. “That's what good teams do this time of year,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said. “Somebody makes a play, the other side of the ball backs it up. That's what we're trying to do.” Cleveland had chances to keep the Steelers within sight, but Hopkins saw a 38-yard field goal at breezy Acrisure Stadium late in the first half sail wide left, then had a 43-yarder drift wide right early in the third quarter. “I need to find a good swing,” said Hopkins, who has an NFL-high nine misses. “The swing has been tough to find this year.” The Steelers scored on the ensuing possession when Wilson executed a perfect run-pass option by faking the ball to Jaylen Warren, rolling right and finding Jefferson wide-open in the end zone from 10 yards out to make it 20-7. Pittsburgh's Elandon Roberts stuffed Jerome Ford for a 5-yard loss on fourth down to end Cleveland's next possession, and Wilson connected with Freiermuth down the seam. The tight end stumbled into the newly painted yellow end zone to send the Browns back to Cleveland with a loss, just like they have during every regular season visit since 2004. It also sets the stage for a daunting finishing stretch for the Steelers, who face Philadelphia, Baltimore and Kansas City over the next three weeks, with two of the games coming on short rest. While Pittsburgh has quieted much of the noise that surrounded the team after a massive offensive overhaul in the offseason - led by the acquisition of Wilson - the Steelers understand the real test is still to come. “Why not test us before the playoffs, get a feel?” Freiermuth said. “They're all playoff teams we're playing, so it'll be great.” Browns: CB Mike Ford Jr. was placed in the concussion protocol in the first quarter.

                "title": "Browns lose to Steelers after numerous errors in Pittsburgh",
                "content": "PITTSBURGH — The Browns couldn't get out of one franchise house of horrors with a win last Monday night when they threw away a potential win at the Denver Broncos. They had another chance to exorcise decades of disappointment in another place Sunday afternoon. Turns out, history is really hard for the Browns to shake. Cleveland went into Pittsburgh on Sunday and continued what has now turned into more than two decades of misery in the Steel City. The Browns were officially eliminated from playoff contention as they lost their 21st consecutive regular-season game in Pittsburgh with a 27-14 loss to the Steelers. The loss prevented the Browns (3-10) from achieving their first series sweep of the Steelers since 1988. Instead, it's the 16th time in 33 seasons the teams have split the season series, the same number of times Pittsburgh has swept the series in that span. The Browns were only down 13-7 at halftime. Kicker Dustin Hopkins missed a 38-yard field goal with less than 30 seconds remaining in the half that could've pulled them closer, which was made even worse when he missed a 43-yarder to open the third quarter. Pittsburgh (10-3) opened up a 27-7 lead through three quarters. Quarterback Jameis Winston was 24-of-41 passing for 211 yards with two touchdowns, two interceptions and a 68.2 passer rating. The Browns turned the ball over three times, compared to just once by the Steelers. Here's how the Browns' latest trip to the Steel City unfolded this afternoon: The Browns cornerback Greg Newsome II appeared to injure his left leg on the muffed punt late by teammate Kadarius Toney. He eventually walked to the locker room before the game ended. The Steelers' Cordarrelle Patterson was stripped by Browns defensive end Isaiah McGuire and the ball was recovered by Myles Garrett at the 50. Two plays later, quarterback Jameis Winston overthrew wide receiver Elijah Moore and the ball was intercepted by Pittsburgh's James Pierre with 3:57 remaining. The Browns pulled within 27-14 of the Steelers with 7:19 remaining. Quarterback Jameis Winston threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to tight end David Njoku, who he went up and got it over a Steelers defender in the front right corner of the end zone. The Browns had a third and 1 from the Steelers 16 on the first play of the fourth quarter. However, a false start and a sack by Cameron Heyward, with a post-play unnecessary roughness penalty on Browns offensive tackle Germain Ifedi, eventually left Cleveland with fourth and 24 from the Pittsburgh 39. The Browns are down 20 heading into the final 15 minutes of the game in Pittsburgh The rout is on for the Steelers. Pittsburgh opened up a 27-7 lead with 3:51 remaining in the third quarter when quarterback Russell Wilson found tight end Pat Freiermuth on the seam route for a 20-yard touchdown. The Browns were about a yard shy of the first down at the Pittsburgh 49. Instead of sneaking the ball with quarterback Jameis Winston, they tried a sweep with running back Jerome Ford, who was dropped for a 5-yard loss by Pittsburgh's Elandon Roberts. The game is starting to get away from the Browns. The Steelers turned the second Dustin Hopkins missed field goal into a 20-7 lead when quarterback Russell Wilson found a wide-open Van Jefferson in the end zone for a 10-yard touchdown with 8:37 remaining in the third quarter. Dustin Hopkins missed another field goal that could've help the Browns get a little closer. This time, he pushed a 38-yard field goal wide right with 12:40 remaining in the third quarter, The Browns got a spark to open the second half. Jerome Ford returned the second-half kickoff 56 yards to the Pittsburgh 39. The Browns failed to close the gap at the end of the first half. They will get the ball to start the second half. The Steelers have a 127-124 edge in total yards. Dustin Hopkins missed wide left on yet another sub-50-yard field goal attempt. This one was a 38-yarder he pushed left with 23 seconds left in the half. Pittsburgh's best true drive of the game got bogged down after an offensive pass interference call on wide receiver Mike Williams. That ultimately forced them to kick a 54-yard field goal by Chris Boswell, to push the lead to 13-7 with 4:21 remaining in the half. Pittsburgh capitalized on the interception, capping five-play drive with a 1-yard touchdown run by Najee Harris with 11 minutes remaining in the half. A big play on the drive was a 16-yard pass interference penalty against cornerback Greg Newsome II on a third-and-7 play from the Browns 28. Browns quarterback Jameis Winston threw his first interception of the game with just over 13 minutes remaining in the first half. Steelers defensive lineman Keeanu Benton stepped in front of a screen pass intended for running back Nick Chubb and intercepted it, returning it to the Browns 31. The Browns took a 7-3 lead into the second quarter over the Steelers. Cleveland has a 69-45 edge in total yards. The Browns offense managed to, with some help from a questionable roughing the passer penalty against Pittsburgh's Alex Highsmith, get to the Steelers 41. It had to punt from there, with the ball being downed at the Steelers 10. Mike Ford Jr. returned to the field on the punt. He was cleared on his head evaluation. Special teams ace Mike Ford Jr. is questionable to return for the Browns. Ford was being evaluated for a head injury. Jameis Winston avoided the pressure, as well as getting completely across the line of scrimmage, to throw a 35-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jerry Jeudy. The pass, plus Dustin Hopkins' point-after kick, gave the Browns a 7-3 lead with 5:50 remaining in the first quarter. Winston got near the line of scrimmage, the Steelers 35, but released the ball before crossing the line. Special teams ace Mike Ford Jr. jogged to the locker room with 9:32 remaining with trainers in tow for the Browns. Ford had been taken originally to the medical tent with the NFL independent spotter going in with him after the Cleveland punt to end its first possession. There's been no immediate update on Ford's injury or status. Chris Boswell put the Steelers on the board with a 30-yard field goal with 9:32 remaining in the first quarter. That capped Pittsburgh's second drive, which started at the Cleveland 36 after a Calvin Austin 11-yard punt return. Here's the first 11 out on the field for the Browns offense: Here's the first 11 out on the field for the Browns defense: The Browns won the coin toss and deferred their choice. The Steelers elected to take the ball to open the game. So all of the pregame back-and-forth ended up being for nothing. Pittsburgh made wide receiver George Pickens inactive after the he sustained a hamstring injury during the week. Pickens and Browns cornerback Greg Newsome II were at a verbal back-and-forth during the week. The feud goes back to the teams' previous meeting on Nov. 21 in Cleveland. Newsome II was engaged with Pickens on the Steelers' final desperation Hail Mary, trying to prevent Pickens from being able to, at the very least, tip the ball to a teammate. Pickens clearly took exception and initially grabbed Newsome by the helmet and dragged him through the end zone and beyond the back line. Pickens threw Newsome down as he ripped off his helmet near the front of the stands. The two scuffled briefly before being separated, although the bad blood to carried into the postgame locker room, where Newsome called Pickens a \"fake tough guy\" while Pickens blamed the loss entirely on the snow. Asked by reporters in Pittsburgh if he planned to talk to Newsome before the game Sunday, Pickens said, \"I don't even know who that is.\" Then, asked about his postgame comments regarding the Browns not being a good team and only winning because of the snow, he replied, \"I just go by their record.\" Newsome was asked shortly after Pickens' comments for his thoughts. He responded. \"Nah, because the only way you would take something that somebody says disrespectful is if you actually care about that person,\" Newsome said Friday. \"So I don't care what he has to say or anybody has to say. So I don't take it as disrespectful because I don't care about the dude at all.\" Kickoff is at 1 p.m. Tickets for Sunday's game on StubHub can be purchased on StubHub from $108 before fees. It's a perfect mostly sunny December afternoon for football in Pittsburgh, with the temperature at kickoff expected to be a high near 47, according to the National Weather Service. Southwest wind 9 to 15 mph, with gusts as high as 25 mph. Cleveland fell to 3-9 on the season with a 41-32 loss to the Denver Broncos on Monday Night Football in Denver. Quarterback Jameis Winston set a career high and Browns franchise single-game passing record with 497 yards, but his four touchdowns were offset by three interceptions, two of which the Broncos returned for touchdowns. Wide receiver Jerry Jeudy also had a career-high 235 receiving yards in his first game back in Denver. The Steelers improved to 9-3 by beating the Cincinnati Bengals 44-38 last Sunday in Cincinnati. Quarterback Russell Wilson threw for 414 yards and three touchdowns in the win. So what should we expect from the Browns this afternoon against the Steelers? Click here to see what our writers project as the score of today's game. Today is the 148th all-time regular-season or playoff meeting between the Browns and the Steelers, which dates back to 1950. Here's a look at the series between Cleveland and Pittsburgh. Offensive tackle Jedrick Wills Jr., who has missed four of the last five games after hyperextending his right knee in Week 7 against the Cincinnati Bengals, was one of two players the Browns placed on injured reserve on Saturday. They did the same with defensive tackle Maurice Hurst II, who suffered injuries to his ankle and foot in last Monday night's loss to the Denver Broncos. Both Wills and Hurst would only be eligible to return for the season finale at the Baltimore Ravens. That would mean both will end their second consecutive season on injured reserve. For Wills, especially, it likely means the end of his Browns' career. He's a free agent after this season, having played this season on his fifth-year option. Wills' fifth season with the Browns, who took him No. 10 overall in the 2020 draft, has been marred by injuries. He didn't start practicing until Sept. 4 as he recovered from arthroscopic knee surgery he underwent last December. Hurst is making his second injured reserve appearance this season. He had an ankle injury in the season opener against the Dallas Cowboys that led to a four-game stint on the injured list. The defensive tackle did play in the previous seven games. He recorded 16 tackles and 0.5 sacks. The corresponding moves helped the Browns take care of another position of need, wide receiver. They signed both wide receivers Kadarius Toney and Michael Woods II from the practice squad to the 53-man active roster. Toney and Woods gives the Browns six wide receivers on the 53-man roster. The problem with that is that only two of the other four — Jerry Jeudy and Elijah Moore — aren't listed on the Browns injury report for Sunday's game as either out (Cedric Tillman) or questionable (Jamari Thrash). The Browns avoided using up Toney's three standard elevations by signing him to the roster. He had been elevated for the Week 11 loss at the New Orleans Saints, where he played six offensive snaps and losing seven yards on one rushing attempt, as well as last Monday night's loss at the Denver Broncos, where he played another six snaps and gained three yards on one rushing attempt while also being targeted on one pass attempt. Where Toney could potentially find steady work is in the return game. The former first-round draft pick had previous returned punts for both the New York Giants and Kansas City Chiefs. Woods was the other game-day elevation for the Denver game, his first elevation of the season. He has been on the Browns' practice squad all season after the 2022 sixth-round pick missed all of last season with an Achilles injury. The third-year pro made the most of his opportunity against the Broncos, which included a career-high 66 offensive snaps. He had three catches for 43 yards — all of which converted third downs on scoring drives — on five targets in Denver. The Browns also elevated wide receiver James Proche II from the practice squad to the gameday roster for Sunday's game at the Pittsburgh Steelers. They did the same for recently-signed defensive tackle T.Y. McGill to add depth to another position where they'll have another player — Sam Kamara — out for Sunday besides Hurst. Proche appeared in four games earlier this season for the Browns before being waived in Week 6, along with another 10 games last season with the team. He was re-signed in Week 7 to the practice squad. McGill was one of two defensive tackles, along with Michael Dwumfour, signed to the practice squad on Friday. The 10-year veteran has appeared in 58 career games with the Colts (2015-16), Browns (2017), Chargers (2018 and 2019), Eagles (2018 and 2020), Vikings (2021) and 49ers (2022-24), with 46 career tackles, 5.5 sacks and two forced fumbles. He appeared in one game with the 49ers this season. Chris Easterling can be reached at ceasterling@thebeaconjournal.com. Read more about the Browns at www.beaconjournal.com/sports/browns.

J. Spiller along with coaches John Heisman, Jess Neely, Frank Howard, and Danny Ford. Clemson is one of the founding members of the ACC and holds 22 ACC titles, the most of any member. Its 28 total conference titles, including six consecutive ACC titles from 2015 to 2020, are the most of any ACC school. Clemson's most recent ACC title came in 2024, against SMU. Clemson's streak of eleven consecutive 10-win seasons from 2011-2022 ranked second in active streaks behind the Alabama Crimson Tide, coming to an end after Clemson's 2023 season where they finished with a 9-4 record.[8][9] Among its eight undefeated regular seasons, Clemson has been crowned national champion 3 times. Clemson was named poll-era national champion and finished with its third perfect season with a win over Nebraska in the 1982 Orange Bowl. Clemson was the National Championship Finalist Runner-up with a 14–1 record in 2015 before winning the National Title over No. 1 Alabama in college football's first National Championship rematch in 2016, and again in 2018. The Tigers have 46 bowl appearances, 20 of which are among the New Year's Six Bowls, including nine during the \"Big Four\" era. Clemson has 34 finishes in the final top 25 in the modern era and it finished in either the Associated Press final poll or the coaches' final poll a combined 59 times since 1939. The Tigers play their home games in Memorial Stadium on the university's Clemson, South Carolina campus. The stadium's nickname, \"Death Valley\" was coined in 1948 by Presbyterian College head coach Lonnie McMillan after his teams were routinely defeated there. Memorial Stadium is among the largest stadiums in college football. Walter Riggs, often regarded as the \"father of Clemson football,\" brought the sport to Clemson from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama (now Auburn University). The team's first game, played on Halloween 1896, resulted in a 2–1 record for the inaugural season. Riggs influenced the choice of the team mascot and colors. The Tigers’ early success included their first undefeated season in 1900 under coach John W. Heisman, who led the team to a 19–3–2 record. Heisman’s coaching set a precedent for excellence and innovation. During the mid-20th century, the program experienced substantial growth under Frank Howard, who coached from 1940 to 1969. Howard's tenure saw Clemson win two Southern Conference championships and six ACC championships. Known for his colorful personality and imaginative storytelling, Howard integrated various offensive formations. His legacy includes the tradition of rubbing \"Howard's Rock\" before home games and the naming of the playing field at Memorial Stadium as \"Frank Howard Field\" in 1974. The late 20th century and early 21st century saw the football program navigate through challenges and successes under multiple head coaches. Danny Ford led the Tigers to their first national championship in 1981, achieving an undefeated season. Ford's era was marked by NCAA sanctions due to recruiting violations, which impacted the program's reputation and success. Ken Hatfield, Ford’s successor, focused on cleaning up the program's image but faced criticism from fans, leading to his resignation. Subsequent coaches, including Tommy West, struggled to achieve consistent success until the hiring of Tommy Bowden in 1999, who maintained bowl eligibility every season, but failed to secure an ACC championship. The modern era is defined by the leadership of Dabo Swinney, who became head coach in 2008. Swinney revitalized the program, leading the Tigers to multiple ACC championships and two national titles in 2016 and 2018. His tenure has been characterized by significant achievements, including the establishment of Clemson as a perennial contender in the College Football Playoff. Swinney’s ability to recruit and develop talent, combined with strategic hires like offensive coordinator Chad Morris and defensive coordinator Brent Venables, has sustained Clemson’s success. Notably, under Swinney, Clemson became the first team since 1897 to finish a season 15–0. In 2022, Clemson defeated Syracuse 27–21, extending the Tigers' home winning streak to 38, a new ACC record. Clemson claims three national championships. In 1981 they finished as the only undefeated team with a 22–15 victory over the No. 4 Nebraska Cornhuskers in the 1982 Orange Bowl, and were named the national champions[10] by all major four consensus selectors [11] (AP, Coaches, FWAA, and NFF). In 2016 and 2018 they won the College Football Playoff, defeating Alabama in the CFP National Championship Game both times. † Other selectors for 1981 included Berryman, Billingsley, DeVold, FACT, FB News, Football Research, Helms, Litkenhous, Matthews, National Championship Foundation, New York Times, Poling, Sagarin, and Sporting News[12]†† Other selectors for 2016 include A&H, BR, CCR, CFRA, DuS, MCFR, SR, W††† Other selectors for 2018 include A&H, BR, CCR, CFRA, CM, DuS, MCFR, SR, W Clemson won the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1900 and 1902 (tied 1903 and 1906) along with the Southern Conference title in 1940 and 1948.[13] Their 22 ACC titles (20 outright, 2 tied) are the most ACC football championships.[citation needed][when?] In 1965, South Carolina violated participation rules relating to two ineligible players and was required to forfeit wins against North Carolina State and Clemson.[14] North Carolina State and Clemson were then declared co-champions.[15] † Co-champions In 2005, the Atlantic Coast Conference divided into two divisions of six teams each and began holding an ACC Championship Game at the conclusion of the regular football season to determine the conference champion. Clemson won its first outright ACC Atlantic Division championship in 2009. In 2012 and 2016, Clemson was co-champion of the Atlantic Division. On August 18, 2011, Georgia Tech vacated their 2009 ACC Championship Game victory over Clemson due to NCAA violations. The game is considered by the NCAA and ACC to have no winner.[16] Clemson was selected as the one seed in the second College Football Playoff and defeated the fourth seed Oklahoma on December 31, 2015, in the 2015 Orange Bowl. They lost to the Alabama Crimson Tide in the championship game on January 11, 2016. Clemson was selected to the third College Football Playoff as the second seed and defeated the third seed Ohio State on December 31, 2016, in the 2016 PlayStation Fiesta Bowl. The Tigers defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide in the national championship games in both 2017 and 2019. Clemson has a 6–4 record in playoff games through the 2019 season. Clemson has ended their football season ranked 38 times in either the AP or Coaches Poll.[17] Clemson had 12 consecutive 10-win seasons from 2011 to 2022. Before the streak came to an end in 2023, it was the 2nd longest active streak behind Alabama with 16.[17] † AP Poll began selecting the nation's Top 20 teams in 1936. Only the Top 10 teams were recognized from 1962 to 1967. The AP Poll expanded back to the Top 20 teams in 1968. In 1989, it began recognizing the Top 25 teams. ‡ UPI/Coaches Poll began selecting its Top 20 teams on a weekly basis in 1950 before expanding to the nation's Top 25 teams in 1990. Clemson holds a 27–23 record in bowl games through the 2022 season.[18] This is a list of Clemson's 16 most recent bowl games. The two southern schools have long, decorated histories in the sport of college football.[33] They first met on the football field on November 29, 1900.[34] Clemson won the inaugural matchup by a score of 35–0.[35] The Crimson Tide and Tigers met again in 1904 and 1905, with Clemson winning both games.[36] Beginning with the next meeting between the two squads in 1909, Alabama won the next thirteen matchups against Clemson.[36] The Tide posted the biggest margin of victory in the rivalry in 1931, beating the Tigers by a margin of 74–7.[37][38] In the first seven games of Alabama's 13-game streak, Clemson only score seven total points and was shut out in six of the seven games.[36] After a 56–0 shutout Alabama victory in 1975, the squads didn't meet again until 2008, when they squared off on opening weekend in Atlanta, Georgia.[39] The Tide emerged victorious with a 34–10 victory.[40] The last four matchups between the squads have had national championship implications and have greatly re-intensified the rivalry. The teams squared off in the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship in Glendale, Arizona, resulting in Alabama emerging with a thrilling 45–40 victory.[41] The next year, the teams again found themselves doing battle in the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship in Tampa, Florida, with Clemson emerging with a last-second 35–31 victory and their first win over the Crimson Tide since 1905.[42] Once again the teams met in the 2018 Sugar Bowl semifinal in New Orleans, Louisiana with a trip to the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship game on the line.[43] Alabama won by a score of 24–6 following two costly Clemson interceptions in the second half.[44] Their most recent meeting was in the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship. This time, Clemson dismantled the No. 1-ranked Crimson Tide in a 44–16 rout to win its third national title. Alabama leads the series 14–5 through the 2023 season.[45] These old rivals (which are often called sister schools) first played in 1899, but until 2010, had not faced each other in the regular season since 1971. Along with snapping a 14-game losing streak to the Tigers of the Plains, Clemson also snapped Auburn's 17-game winning streak coming off of the 2009–2011 seasons after a home-and-home series in the 2010–11 seasons. The Georgia Dome then hosted the Auburn–Clemson rivalry the following year in the 2012 Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game. Clemson defeated Auburn 26–19 riding on a 231-yard performance by Andre Ellington. This game was notable due to Sammy Watkins' absence, having been suspended the first two games due to a drug-related arrest in May 2012. Auburn leads the overall series 34–15–2 through the 2018 season.[46] The O'Rourke–McFadden Trophy was created in 2008 by the Boston College Gridiron Club to honor the tradition at both schools and to honor the legacy of Charlie O'Rourke and Banks McFadden, who played during the leather helmet era. The club plans to make this an annual presentation. Clemson first met Boston College on the football field in the 1940 Cotton Bowl Classic, the first ever bowl game for the Tigers and Eagles. Over the next 43 years, the teams met a total of 14 times. In 2005, Boston College joined the ACC and the Atlantic Division. Since then, the game has been played on an annual basis with Clemson winning the last 11 meetings. As of 2022 the Tigers lead the series 21–9–2.[47] Between 1999 and 2007 the ACC Atlantic Division matchup between Clemson and Florida State was referred to as the \"Bowden Bowl\" to reflect the father-son head coach matchup between Bobby Bowden (Father, FSU) and Tommy Bowden (Son, Clemson). Their first meeting, in 1999, was the first time in Division I-A history that a father and a son met as opposing head coaches in a football game. Bobby Bowden won the first four matchups extending FSU's winning streak over Clemson to 11 dating back to 1992. Since 2003, Clemson is 11–6, including a 26–10 win in Clemson over then-No. 3 FSU. Also during this time the Tigers recorded a 27–20 win in Tallahassee in 2006 which broke a 17-year losing streak in Doak Campbell Stadium. 2007 was the last Bowden Bowl game as Tommy resigned as head coach in October 2008. No. 3 Clemson pulled off a thriller in Tallahassee in 2016, 37–34, over the No. 12-ranked Seminoles. In 2018, No. 2 Clemson defeated Florida State in Tallahassee 59–10, which tied the Seminoles' worst loss margin in history. This marked a 2nd time the Tigers have beaten the Seminoles by more than 17-points. Clemson did it again in 2019, beating FSU 45–14. FSU has defeated Clemson by more than 17-points nine times. The most lopsided contest occurred in 1993, with the FSU squad winning 57–0. As of 2022, Florida State leads the overall series 20–15.[48] Before the dissolution of divisions in ACC Football as of 2023, the annual Clemson-Florida State game often decided which team would represent the Atlantic Division in the ACC Championship. However, under the ACC's new scheduling system, Clemson and Florida State are designated as permanent rivals and will continue to compete for the title every year. Because of the new ACC scheduling system, there is a chance these rivals could face each other a second time in the ACC Championship. The Bulldogs and the Tigers have played each other 64 times beginning in 1897, with the 64th meeting played in 2014. Clemson's only regular-season losses of the 1978, 1982, and 1991 campaigns all came at the hands of Georgia \"between the hedges\", whereas Georgia's only regular-season setback during the three years of the Herschel Walker era came in Death Valley during Danny Ford's 1981 national championship run. During the two programs' simultaneous glory days of the early 1980s, no rivalry in all of college football was more important at the national level.[49] The Bulldogs and Tigers played each other every season from 1973 to 1987, with Scott Woerner's dramatic returns in 1980 and the nine turnovers forced by the Tigers in 1981 effectively settling the eventual national champion. No rivalry of that period was more competitive, as evidenced by the critical 11th-hour field goals kicked by Kevin Butler in 1984 and by David Treadwell more than once later in the decade. Despite blowouts in 1990 by the Tigers and in 1994 and 2003 by the Bulldogs, the series typically has remained very competitive with evenly matched games. Most recently, Georgia defeated Clemson 10–3 in the 2021 Duke's Mayo Classic with neither team scoring an offensive touchdown; Georgia went on to win the national title in 2021. The Bulldogs maintains a 43–18–4 lead in the series.[50] Clemson's rivalry with Georgia Tech dates to 1898 with the first game being played in Augusta, Georgia.[51] Notably, both programs share the privilege of having John Heisman as a former coach. It was played in Atlanta for 44 of the first 47 match-ups, until Georgia Tech joined the ACC. When the Yellowjackets joined the ACC in 1978, the series moved to a more traditional home-and-home setup beginning with the 1983 game. When the ACC expanded to 12 teams and split into two divisions in 2005, Clemson and Georgia Tech were placed in opposite divisions but were designated permanent cross-divisional rivals so that the series may continue uninterrupted. In the new system without divisions, they remain as such. The two schools are 127 miles apart and connected to each other by Interstate 85. This distance is slightly closer than that between Clemson and traditional rival South Carolina (137 miles). Georgia Tech leads the series 50–35–2 with Clemson winning the last 8 in a row.[52] The yearly conference and divisional match-up with NC State is known as the Textile Bowl for the schools' similar missions in research and development for the textile industry in the Carolinas. The first meeting of the two schools occurred in 1899. Clemson has won 18 out of 23 contests since 2000. It is a particularly bitter rivalry amongst fans and students of both schools, even though it is not as competitive as the vitriol would suggest. Clemson holds a 60–30–1 series advantage through the 2023 season. NC State has won 2 out of the last 3 games in the rivalry.[53] The Clemson–South Carolina rivalry, which dates back to 1896, is the largest annual sporting event in terms of ticket sales in the state of South Carolina. From 1896 to 1959, the Clemson–South Carolina game was played on the fairgrounds in Columbia, South Carolina and was referred to as \"Big Thursday.\" Beginning in 1960, an alternating-site format was implemented using both teams' home stadiums. The annual game has since been designated \"The Palmetto Bowl.\"[54] The last eight contests between the programs have been nationally televised (4 on ESPN, 4 on ESPN2). Clemson holds a commanding 73–43-4 lead in the series through the 2022 season.[55] It is often considered one of the most heated rivalries in all of college football, on a similar level to the Auburn-Alabama and Ohio State-Michigan rivalries, respectively.[56] In 1951, the College Football Hall of Fame opened in South Bend, Indiana. Clemson has had 3 players and 4 former coaches inducted into the Hall of Fame.[57] The NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the Associated Press (AP), American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), The Sporting News (TSN), and the Walter Camp Football Foundation (WCFF) to determine if a player is regarded as a Consensus or Unanimous All-American. To be selected a Consensus All-American, a player must be chosen to the first team on at least three of the five official selectors as recognized by the NCAA. If a player is named an All-American by all five organizations, he is recognized as a Unanimous All-America. Clemson players have been honored 28 times as Consensus All-Americans, and 6 times as Unanimous All-Americas.[70][71] † Unanimous All-American On July 23, 2002, in celebration of the Atlantic Coast Conference's 50th Anniversary, a 120-member blue ribbon committee selected the Top 50 football players in ACC history. Clemson led all conference schools with the most players selected to the Golden Anniversary team.[72] Each of Clemson's honorees are All-Americans and former NFL players. The nine selectees from Clemson are: Source ESPN[when?] [17][73] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ACC temporarily added Notre Dame as a member for just the 2020 season. Wins and losses to Notre Dame in 2020 count toward standings and all-time records.

                "title": "Jets vs. Dolphins Game Recap 12/8/2024",
                "content": "Senior Reporter Locked in yet another close contest late Sunday against the Dolphins, the Jets were unable to flip the script as the Miami erased the Jets' two fourth-quarter leads to force overtime. Owning an 0-6 record in games decided by 6 points or fewer entering Week 14, the Jets never touched the ball in the extra session and dropped a 32-26 OT decision as Tua Tagovailoa hit TE Jonnu Smith from 10 yards out for the game-winner. Despite QB Aaron Rodgers passing for 300-plus yards for the first time in 35 games, the Jets (3-10) lost their fourth consecutive contest and their first win at Miami since 2014 proved elusive. The 'Fins (6-7) won for the fourth time in five games and kept their playoff hopes alive. Anders Carlson's 42-yard field goal with 52 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter gave the Jets a 26-23 lead that stood for 45 seconds until Jason Sanders had an emphatic answer from 52 yards out. Then Miami won the coin toss before the start of overtime and Smith had 3 catches for 44 yards on the final possession. \"We have to find a way to finish and close these things out,\" said interim head coach Jeff Ulbrich. \"We have to be at our best when our best is required and we're not getting that accomplished and I have to look at myself first.\" Rodgers turned back the clock as the Jets had 100-yard efforts from Garrett Wilson (7-114) and Davante Adams (9-109-1TD). And with star RB Breece Hall (knee) inactive, rookie backs Isaiah Davis and Braelon Allen had a combined 28 touches for 148 yards. But Tagovailoa passed for 331 yards, Tyreek Hill had 10 catches for 115 yards and Jaylen Waddle added 9 grabs for 99 yards. \"It's very frustrating,\" Adams said. \"Been right there and have had opportunities whether it's the offense to go down and finish it off or if it's the defense to close it out. And we just haven't finished the game.\" With the Jets trailing by 15-13 at halftime in a seesaw affair, Rodgers stayed hot at the outset of the third quarter. Wilson won up the visiting sideline with a double move and Rodgers was on the money with a 42-yarder to the Miami 26. Then after Rodgers converted the Jets' second fourth down with a 15-yard short pass to Davis, he rifled a 3-yard pass to Adams as the Green & White grabbed a 20-15 advantage. Carlson pushed the lead to 8 points, 23-15, with a 40-yard field goal but the 'Fins had an answer. Tagovailoa deadlocked things at 23, not only hitting Hill for a TD on fourth-and-4 but following it up with a successful 2-point attempt to Waddle. See all of the best game photos from the Week 14 game in Miami. There were seven combined possessions, four lead changes and 28 points in the first half. Sanders' 57-yard rocket shot at the end of the second quarter was the difference as Miami had a 15-13 lead at the break. Rodgers (11 of 17 for 152 yards) and Tagovailoa (15 of 18 for 165 yards) were effective and efficient out of the gate. Miami had the slight yardage edge (204 to 195) as neither team had much success on third down (Jets 1 of 4 and Miami 0 of 3) and the Green & White were just 1 of 3 in the red zone. \"We had chances, a lot of chances,\" Rodgers said. \"We just have to look at the offense. That's what we can control. We have to score touchdowns in the red zone. … We had our chances to get to 30 today – didn't do it and that's why we lost.\" Allen and Davis made immediate impacts on the Jets' first two drives. Allen, a fourth-round pick from Wisconsin, had a 7-yard run on the offense's first play and later added a pair of catches for 22 yards on a possession that ended on Carlson's 28-yard field goal. After the Jets kept their second possession alive with a fourth-down conversion from Rodgers to Wilson that covered 35 yards, Davis exploded through a hole on the left side of the offensive line for a 17-yard TD. Carlson's extra point gave the Jets a 10-9 lead and Davis, a fifth-round pick from South Dakota State, had his first NFL rush TD and second score in as many weeks. Using another explosive play through the air, Rodgers flipped the field late in the second stanza with a 34-yard connection to Adams. That same pair also accounted for the first third-down conversion of the game on a 10-yard hook-up on a third-and-6 helped set up Carlson's 30-yarder with 52 seconds remaining in the second quarter. Amassing 9 first downs on their first 14 plays, the 'Fins gained 104 yards on their first two drives while taking a 9-3 lead. The Dolphins culminated their 8-play, 70-yard opening drive with RB Devon Achane's 2-yard scoring run. The Jets were penalized twice on the possession as DT Javon Kinlaw was flagged for unnecessary roughness after Waddle's 20-yard catch-and-run and CB D.J. Reed was flagged for pass interference on a third-and-goal snap from the Miami 1. Sanders followed up a missed extra point with a 39-yard field goal at the beginning of the second quarter. The Jets outgained the Dolphins (402 to 375), almost doubled Miami in rush yards (83 to 44) and held the 'Fins to 1 of 9 on third down. They also didn't turn the ball over but another close one went the other way. \"There are some teams that might relent a little bit, that might relax a little bit, might start thinking about the offseason and might start thinking about their own thing,\" Ulbrich said. \"I haven't felt that from that locker room at all. They have absolutely stayed together, they continue to fight and it's a great testament to them.\" Jetcetera The second-quarter TD pass from Aaron Rodgers to Davante Adams was their 79th, moving the pair into fourth place as a duo … The Jets were charged with 10 penalties for 83 yards while the Dolphins had 49 yards marked off their 8 infractions. … LB Jamien Sherwood had 18 tackles (13 solos) while CB Brandin Echols, who got the start in place of CB Sauce Gardner (hamstring), had 10 stops. … The Jets rush defense held RB De'Von Achane to 24 yards on 14 carries. ….

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Miami Dolphins and New York Jets combined to make NFL history on Sunday. During Miami's win over New York, not only did the Dolphins keep their faint playoff hopes alive with their overtime win, but the two teams ended up giving us a final score that's never been seen before in NFL history. The Dolphins sent the game to overtime when Jason Sanders hit a 52-yard field goal on the final play of regulation to tie things up at 26. Miami then won the toss in overtime and decided to take the ball, which ended up being a good decision, because it was able to march 70 yards down the field to score the game-winning touchdown. The 10-yard scoring throw from Tua Tagovailoa to Jonnu Smith was a big one because it gave us a scorigami: The 32-26 final marked the first time in NFL history that a game had ever ended with that exact score. Score Update:NYJ 26 - 32 MIAFinalThat's Scorigami!! It's the 1089th unique final score in NFL history. As you can see above, it's the 1,089th unique final score in NFL history. If this had been a playoff game, the Dolphins would have had to attempt an extra point in overtime, and in that case, it would NOT have been a scorigami because 33-26 has happened before. However, under the NFL's overtime rules for a regular-season game, if a team scores a touchdown on the opening drive of overtime, then the game is over and there's no extra point attempt. Tua Tagovailoa was nearly perfect in overtime, going 6 of 7 for 67 yards and a touchdown. Overall, Tua threw for 331 yards and two touchdowns. Aaron Rodgers also had a big game: With 339 yards, the Jets QB hit the 300-yard mark for the first time since December 2021. As for the unique final score, there have been five scorigamis this season, and the Jets have actually been involved in two of them. They also had the first scorigami of the year back in Week 1 during a 32-19 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. As for the Dolphins, this was their fourth scorigami since the start of the 2023 season, but their first one of 2024. With just five scorigamis through 14 weeks, it's becoming unlikely that we're going to see the 2024 season surpass the total from 2023 when there were nine scorigamis. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

He served as president and chief executive officer of Def Jam Recordings from 2004 to 2007, and founded the entertainment company Roc Nation the following year.[13] A protégé of fellow New York City-based rapper Jaz-O, Jay-Z began his musical career in the late 1980s; he co-founded the record label Roc-A-Fella Records in 1994 to release his first two studio albums Reasonable Doubt (1996) and In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997), both of which were met with critical acclaim. Each of his eleven subsequent albums, including The Blueprint (2001), The Black Album (2003), American Gangster (2007), and 4:44 (2017), debuted atop the Billboard 200; Jay-Z holds the record for the most number-one albums (14) of any solo artist on the chart.[14][15][16] He has also released the collaborative albums The Best of Both Worlds (2002) and Unfinished Business (2004) with singer R. Kelly,[17] Collision Course (2004) with Linkin Park, Watch the Throne (2011) with Kanye West, and Everything Is Love (2018) with his wife Beyoncé.[18] He peaked the Billboard Hot 100 on four occasions: once as a lead artist with his 2009 single \"Empire State of Mind\" (featuring Alicia Keys), and thrice with his guest performances on the singles \"Heartbreaker\" by Mariah Carey, \"Crazy in Love\" by Beyoncé, and \"Umbrella\" by Rihanna.[19] Through his business ventures, Jay-Z became the first hip-hop billionaire in 2019.[20][21] In 1999, he co-founded the clothing retailer Rocawear[22] and later founded the 40/40 Club, a luxury bar chain, in 2003. As both grew into multi-million-dollar businesses, he launched Roc Nation, a multi-disciplinary entertainment agency in 2008. In 2015, he acquired the technology company Aspiro and led the expansion of Tidal, the company's media streaming service.[23][24][25] As of 2024, he is the wealthiest musical artist in the world with a net worth of US$2.5 billion.[26] One of the world's best-selling music artists with 140 million records sold, Jay-Z has won 24 Grammy Awards, the tenth-most of all time and most awarded for any hip hop artist jointly with Kanye West.[27] He has been awarded the NAACP's President's Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Sports Emmy Award, and been nominated for a Tony Award. Ranked by Billboard and Rolling Stone as one of the 100 greatest artists of all time,[28][29] Jay-Z was the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame[30] and the first solo living rapper inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013.[8] Shawn Corey Carter was born on December 4, 1969, in Brooklyn, New York City.[31] He was raised in Marcy Houses, a public housing project in Brooklyn's Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood.[32] His father, Adnis Reeves,[33] abandoned the family when Jay-Z was 11 years old, and Jay-Z and his three older siblings were raised by his mother, Gloria Carter. Reeves later met and reconciled with Jay-Z prior to his death in 2003. Jay-Z claims in his lyrics to \"You Must Love Me\", the closing track on his 1997 album In My Lifetime, Vol. 1, that in 1982, at age 12, he shot his older brother Eric in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry.[34][35] He attended Eli Whitney High School and George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, both in Brooklyn, and then Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey. He did not graduate, dropping out during his sophomore year at Trenton Central High School.[36] According to his interviews and lyrics, he sold crack cocaine[35] and was shot at three times during this period.[34] His former friend was sentenced to prison for possessing drugs and weapons.[37][38] Known as \"Jazzy\" around the neighborhood, he later adopted the stage name \"Jay-Z\" in homage to his mentor Jaz-O.[32][39] Jay-Z can be briefly heard on several of Jaz-O's early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \"H. P. Gets Busy\", \"The Originators\" and \"Hawaiian Sophie\".[40][41] Jay-Z became embroiled in several battles with rapper LL Cool J in the early 1990s.[42] He first became known to a wide audience on the posse cut \"Show and Prove\" on the 1994 Big Daddy Kane album Daddy's Home. Jay-Z has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane's hype man during this period,[43] although Kane explains that he did not fill the traditional hype man role, and was instead basically making cameo appearances on stage. \"When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage.\"[44][45] According to his second verse on \"99 Problems\", released in 2003, Jay-Z was allegedly stopped by an NYPD detective in 1994 while en route to I-95, possibly for a search of drugs in his car. Detection dogs were called, but another police car had passed; Jay-Z was let go soon after.[46] Jay-Z appeared on a popular song by Big L, \"Da Graveyard\", and on Mic Geronimo's \"Time to Build\", which also featured early appearances by his former Murder Inc. colleagues Ja Rule and DMX in 1995. His first official rap single was \"In My Lifetime\", which was released with an accompanying music video in 1995. An unreleased music video was also produced for the B-side \"I Can't Get with That.\"[47] With no major label to give him a record deal, Jay-Z sold burned CDs out of his car,[34] and with Damon \"Dame\" Dash and Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke, created Roc-A-Fella Records as an independent label in 1995. After striking a distribution deal with Priority, Jay-Z released his 1996 debut album Reasonable Doubt with beats from acclaimed producers such as DJ Premier and Super DJ Clark Kent and an appearance by The Notorious B.I.G. The album reached number 23 on the Billboard 200, and was generally favored by critics.[32] This album would later be included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time as No. 248 and eventually reach platinum status.[48] After reaching a new label distribution deal with Def Jam in 1997, Jay-Z released his follow-up In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. Featuring production by Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs, DJ Premier, and Ski, it earned platinum status in the United States.[48] In 1998, Jay-Z released Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life which spawned the biggest hit of his career at the time, \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\". He relied more on flow and wordplay, and he continued with his penchant for mining beats from the popular producers of the day such as Swizz Beatz, an upstart in-house producer for Ruff Ryders, and Timbaland.[49] Other producers included DJ Premier, Erick Sermon, The 45 King, and Kid Capri. Charting hits from this album included \"Can I Get A...\", featuring Ja Rule and Amil, and \"Nigga What, Nigga Who\", featuring Amil and Jaz-O. Vol. 2 would eventually become Jay-Z's most commercially successful album; it was certified 5× Platinum in the United States and has to date sold over five million copies.[48] The album went on to win a Grammy Award, although Jay-Z boycotted the ceremony protesting DMX's failure to garner a Grammy nomination and the academy's decision to not broadcast urban music categories.[50] In 1999, Jay-Z collaborated with Mariah Carey on \"Heartbreaker\", a song from her seventh album, Rainbow. The song became Jay-Z's first chart-topper in the U.S., spending two weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.[51] In that same year, Jay-Z released Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter. The album proved successful and sold over 3 million copies.[48] Vol. 3's most successful single was \"Big Pimpin\", featuring UGK. In 2000, Jay-Z released The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, which was originally intended to become a compilation album for Roc-A-Fella artists but Def Jam turned into a Jay-Z album.[52] The album helped to introduce newcomer producers The Neptunes, Just Blaze, Kanye West, and Bink, which have all gone on to achieve notable success. This is also the first album where Jay-Z utilizes a more soulful sound than his previous albums. The Dynasty sold over two million units in the U.S. alone.[48] In 2001, Jay-Z spoke out against Prodigy after he took an issue with a Jay-Z line from \"Money, Cash, Hoes\" that he felt alluded disparagingly to Mobb Deep and Prodigy's dispute with Tupac Shakur, Snoop Dogg, and Death Row Records. He later performed the song \"Takeover\", at Summer Jam 2001, which initially attacked Prodigy and revealed photos of Prodigy dressed like Michael Jackson.[53] A line at the end of \"Takeover\" referred to Nas, who criticized him on \"We Will Survive\".[54] Nas responded with a diss of his own, and Jay-Z straightaway added a verse to \"Takeover\" which dissed Nas and would start a feud between the two rappers. The feud had ended by 2005; Jay-Z stated that record producer Mark Pitts had helped them settle their differences.[55] On September 11, 2001, Jay-Z released his sixth studio album, The Blueprint, which received a five-mic review from hip-hop magazine The Source. Written in just two days,[56] the album sold more than 427,000 copies, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200[57] and reached double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.[48] Eminem guest performed and produced its song, \"Renegade\". Four tracks were produced by Kanye West. The Blueprint includes the songs \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\", \"Girls, Girls, Girls\", \"Jigga That Nigga\", and \"Song Cry\". As of February 2012[update], the album had sold 2.7 million copies worldwide.[58] In 2019, The Blueprint was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[59] In October 2001, Jay-Z pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for stabbing record producer Lance Rivera at the Kit Kat Klub in New York City in 1999.[60] Despite Jay-Z's sentence of three years probation for the crime, Rivera later recanted the allegations in 2023.[61][62] Jay-Z then collaborated with Chicago singer R. Kelly to release collaborative studio album, The Best of Both Worlds in March 2002. In November of that year, Jay-Z released his seventh studio album The Blueprint2: The Gift & The Curse—a double album. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number one, selling over 3 million units solely in the U.S.[48] and surpassing The Blueprint.[63] It yielded a single-disc re-issue, The Blueprint 2.1, which retained half of the songs from the original. Its original release spawned two hit singles, \"Excuse Me Miss\" and \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\", which features Jay-Z's then-girlfriend, Beyoncé, and contained the track \"A Dream\", featuring Faith Evans and the late Notorious B.I.G.; the re-issue spawned the single \"La-La-La\", which was a sequel to \"Excuse Me Miss\" and failed to match its commercial success. After visiting the south of France,[64] Jay-Z announced work on his eighth studio album, The Black Album at the opening of the 40/40 Club.[65] He worked with several producers including Just Blaze, The Neptunes, Kanye West, Timbaland, Eminem, DJ Quik, 9th Wonder, The Buchanans, and Rick Rubin. Notable songs on the album included \"What More Can I Say\", \"Dirt off Your Shoulder\", \"Change Clothes\", and \"99 Problems\". The Black Album has sold over 3 million copies in the U.S.[48] On November 25, 2003, Jay-Z held a concert—billed as a \"retirement party\" at Madison Square Garden in New York City, which was later the focus of his 2004 documentary, Fade to Black. All proceeds went to charity. Other performers included collaborators the Roots (in the form of his backing band), Missy Elliott, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Siegel, Freeway, Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé, Twista, Ghostface Killah, Foxy Brown, Pharrell Williams and R. Kelly, with appearances by Voletta Wallace and Afeni Shakur, the mothers of the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur, respectively.[66] While Jay-Z had attested to a retirement from making new studio albums, various side projects and appearances soon followed. Included in these were a greatest hits record, as well as the release and tour of Unfinished Business, the second collaborative album between Jay-Z and R. Kelly. In 2004, Jay-Z collaborated with rock group Linkin Park, in which they released their collaborative remix EP Collision Course, which featured mashups of both artists' songs, as well as a concert DVD. The album's only single, \"Numb/Encore\", went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, and was performed with Linkin Park live at the Grammys, with a special appearance by Paul McCartney, who added verses from the song \"Yesterday\". The EP sold over 1 million copies in the U.S.[48] Jay-Z was the executive producer of The Rising Tied, the debut album of Fort Minor, the hip hop side project of Linkin Park rapper Mike Shinoda. Jay-Z also planned to retire in 2004.[67] Later in 2004, Jay-Z was named president of Def Jam Records, which led to Jay-Z, Dash and Biggs selling their remaining interests in Roc-A-Fella Records and Jay-Z taking control of both of the companies.[68] Reportedly this major industry move was prompted by disagreements between Jay-Z and Dash as to what direction Roc-A-Fella could undertake.[69] On October 27, 2005, Jay-Z headlined New York's Power 105.1 annual concert, Powerhouse. The concert was entitled the \"I Declare War\" concert leading to intense speculation in the weeks preceding the event on whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war. As he had previously \"declared war\" on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events, many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay-Z upon his rivals.[70] The theme of the concert was Jay-Z's position as president and CEO of Def Jam, complete with an on-stage mock-up of the Oval Office. Many artists made appearances such as the old roster of Roc-A-Fella records artists, as well as Ne-Yo, Teairra Marí, T.I., Young Jeezy, Akon, Kanye West, Paul Wall, The LOX, and Diddy.[71] At the conclusion of the concert, Jay-Z put many arguments to rest to the surprise of hip hop fans. The most significant development in this show was closure to the infamous hip hop rivalry between Jay-Z and Nas. The two former rivals shook hands and shared the stage together to perform Jay-Z's \"Dead Presidents\" blended with Nas's song \"The World is Yours\".[72] Jay-Z returned with his comeback album on November 21, 2006, titled Kingdom Come.[73] Jay-Z's comeback single, \"Show Me What You Got\", was leaked on the Internet in early October 2006, scheduled to be released later on that month, received heavy air-play after its leak, causing the FBI to step in and investigate.[74] Jay-Z worked with video director Hype Williams, and the single's video was directed by F. Gary Gray. The album features production from Just Blaze, Pharrell, Kanye West, Dr. Dre and Coldplay's Chris Martin (single entitled \"Beach Chair\").[75][76] The first week saw 680,000 sales of the CD, enough to be his \"biggest sales week ever\" as Billboard reported.[77] This album has sold 2 million copies in the U.S.[48] Jay-Z released his tenth album entitled American Gangster on November 6, 2007. After viewing the Ridley Scott film of the same name, Jay-Z was heavily inspired to create a new \"concept\" album that depicts his experiences as a street-hustler.[78] The album is not the film's official soundtrack, although it was distributed by Def Jam.[79] Jay-Z's American Gangster depicts his life in correlation to the movie American Gangster. At the start of the album's first single, \"Blue Magic\", Jay-Z offers a dealer's manifesto while making references to political figures of the late 1980s with the lyric: \"Blame Reagan for making me to into a monster, blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra, I ran contraband that they sponsored, before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert.\"[80] Also notable about the \"Blue Magic\" music video was Jay-Z flashing €500 notes; Harvard Business School professor Rawi Abdelal called this a \"turning point in American pop culture's response to globalization.\" The album has sold 1 million copies in the U.S.[48] On January 1, 2008, Jay-Z resigned as president of Def Jam.[81] In winter 2008, it was announced that Jay-Z would become the first major hip hop artist to headline Britain's Glastonbury Festival.[82][83] Tickets sold out quickly. Former headliner Noel Gallagher of Oasis condemned the festival organizers for choosing Jay-Z to headline a traditionally guitar-driven festival. \"I'm sorry, but Jay-Z?\" Gallagher asked, swearing. \"No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of, kind of, guitar music, do you know what I mean? And even when they throw the odd curve balls in on a Sunday night—you go, 'Kylie Minogue? I don't know about that', do you know what I mean?—but I'm not having hip hop at Glastonbury, no way, no, no. It's wrong.\"[84] As controversy mounted, Jay-Z replied, \"We don't play guitars, Noel, but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression. Rap music is still evolving. We have to respect each other's genre of music and move forward.\"[85] Jay-Z opened his Glastonbury set with a tongue-in-cheek cover of Oasis's iconic song \"Wonderwall\",[86] and went on to deliver a performance heralded as a successful response to pre-festival criticism.[87] He also headlined many other summer festivals in 2008, including Roskilde Festival in Denmark,[88] Hove Festival in Norway[89] and O2 Wireless Festival in London.[90] During Kanye West's concert of August 6, 2008, at Madison Square Garden, Jay-Z came out to perform a new song and he and West proclaimed that it was to be on The Blueprint 3.[91] On May 21, 2009, Jay-Z announced he would be parting ways with Def Jam, and had struck a multi-million-dollar deal to sign with Live Nation, with whom he would start his Roc Nation imprint which would serve as a record label, talent/management agency, and music publishing company[92] and also partnered with production team Stargate to start a record label called StarRoc.[93][94] Jay-Z's 11th studio album The Blueprint 3 was originally to be released on September 11, 2009,[95] but was instead released in North America on September 8, 2009, due to increasing anticipation.[96] Its international release followed on September 14.[97] It is his 11th album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200[98] and has surpassed Elvis Presley's previous record, making him the current solo-artist record holder.[99] On October 9, 2009, Jay-Z kicked off his tour for The Blueprint 3, during which he supported his new album in North America. In a Shave Magazine review of his performance at Rexall Place in Edmonton, Jake Tomlinson expressed that \"It was the type of smooth performance you would expect from the hip-hop superstar.\" The review gave this performance 4 stars. His North American tour continued until November 22, 2009.[100] At his concert on November 8, 2009, at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, Rihanna joined him on stage and performed \"Hard\" for the first time, then performed \"Run This Town\" with Jay-Z.[101] Among his success, Jay-Z has ventured into producing Broadway shows. Along with Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith, Jay-Z helped produce the play Fela!, a musical celebrating the work of the late Nigerian star Fela Kuti.[102] Jay-Z said he was inspired by the power of Kuti's work and his life story, which resulted in his interest to help produce the musical.[102] Fela! is a story about an African pioneer and political activist who made his first moves on the scene during the 1970s.[102] On January 23, 2010, Jay-Z released a track, \"Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)\", with Rihanna, and U2's Bono and The Edge, as well as performing it at the Hope For Haiti Now telethon.[103] In June 2010, Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in a pair of concerts in Detroit and New York. The event was dubbed The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts rapidly sold out, prompting the scheduling of an additional show at each venue.[104] Jay-Z was the supporting act for U2 on the Australian and New Zealand leg of their U2 360° Tour, beginning in Auckland, New Zealand, in November 2010, followed by Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth in December.[105] Jay-Z also appeared on stage during U2 performances of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", and in Auckland also on a five-track EP entitled Watch the Throne, although it was later revealed by West that the project had become a full-length LP. Recording sessions for the album took place at various recording locations and began in November 2010. The first single released for the project was \"H•A•M\". The track was co-produced by Lex Luger and West himself. The track ended up being on the deluxe edition of the album. The follow-up to that was the second single \"Otis\", which premiered on Funkmaster Flex's Hot 97 radio show, and was later released to the iTunes Store eleven days later. The song's existence, along with several other tracks from the album, was confirmed during a listening session hosted by Jay-Z.[106] The album was first released on the iTunes Store, five days prior to its being released in physical format, a strategy Jay-Z later said was used to block an internet leak. It debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Store in 23 countries. It also broke Coldplay's record for most albums sold in one week on the online retailer, selling 290,000 copies on iTunes alone. It held that record until Lil Wayne's Tha Carter IV was released twenty-one days later, selling 10,000 copies more. It debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart at No. 1, selling 436,000 copies in its first week. The album received generally positive reviews. Jay-Z and West later gave a surprise performance of \"Otis\" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. Jay-Z collaborated with M.I.A on her single \"XXXO\", which achieved a fair level of success and went on to become remixed by several producers worldwide. In May 2012, Jay-Z and former Philadelphia mayor Michael A. Nutter announced Jay-Z as the curator and the headliner for the first annual \"Budweiser Made in America\" festival at Fairmount Park in Philadelphia on September 1 and 2, 2012. The performance was produced by Live Nation and assembled an eclectic lineup of \"rock, hip hop, R&B, Latin music and dance\" musicians.[107] Jay-Z and Rihanna were the two main headlining acts for BBC Radio 1's 2012 Hackney Weekend music festival on June 23 to 24.[108] Jay-Z opened his set with an appearance from Rihanna, they performed \"Run this Town\". On September 6, \"Clique\" was released, a single from the album \"Cruel Summer\", by GOOD Music. Kanye West and Big Sean starred alongside Jay-Z on the track. Jay-Z took the subway to his sold-out show at The Barclays Center on October 6, 2012.[109] On November 12, 2012, Coldplay announced that they will be playing with Jay-Z at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 31.[110] On September 23, 2010, Q-Tip confirmed working on Jay-Z's follow-up album to The Blueprint 3, saying the album was to hit stores by spring 2011.[111] In May 2012 it was reported that Jay-Z would work on new music with Roc Nation producer Jahlil Beats. Beats told XXL magazine: \"Me and Jay-Z been going back and forth. He picked a couple of my joints that he's working on. I don't even wanna say too much about Jay, but we definitely working on some stuff. I haven't even sent him a bunch of beats. I sent him my favorite stuff. He hit me right back like, 'Yo, I'ma go in on this,' or, 'I like this.'\"[112] The album has been named one of the most anticipated albums of 2013 by Complex Magazine, MTV, and XXL. Production will come from Jahlil Beats, Kanye West, Rick Rubin, Swizz Beatz, Timbaland, and Pharrell Williams.[113][114] Jay-Z also made an appearance on Justin Timberlake's comeback single \"Suit & Tie\" from his third studio album The 20/20 Experience, the song itself was produced by both Jay-Z and Timberlake's mutual friend, Timbaland.[115] Timberlake and Jay-Z embarked on the co-headlining Legends of the Summer Stadium Tour.[116] During the fifth game of the 2013 NBA Finals, Carter announced his twelfth studio album, Magna Carta Holy Grail, and was released on July 4, 2013. Not long after, Jay-Z confirmed that the hyphen in his stage name would be left out and officially stylized in all capital letters.[117] Magna Carta Holy Grail debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 528,000 copies in its first week, which bypassed its predicted debut in the range of 350,000 to 400,000.[118] In December 2013, it was announced that Jay-Z had received nine nominations at the 2014 Grammy Awards, more than any other artist.[119] Jay-Z appeared on his wife Beyoncé's self-titled fifth studio album, Beyoncé, with a feature on the song \"Drunk in Love\". They performed this song together at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards opening.[120] The song and its accompanying album would later win three Grammy Awards including Best R&B Performance at the 2015 ceremony. In 2016, he won a lawsuit for the song \"Made in America\" with Kanye West featuring Frank Ocean against Joel McDonald.[121] In early June 2017, posters were displayed in New York City and Los Angeles, and banner ads were placed on the Internet promoting a Tidal-related project titled 4:44.[122] A teaser ad was aired during the NBA Finals on June 7 featuring actors Mahershala Ali, Lupita Nyong'o and Danny Glover in a one-minute video, ending in \"4:44 – 6.30.17, Exclusively on Tidal\". On June 18, the project was confirmed to be a new Jay-Z album, and a clip featuring a song titled \"Adnis\" was posted on Sprint's YouTube page.[122] 4:44 was released through Roc Nation and Universal Music Group, as an exclusive to Sprint and Tidal customers. The album is the first in a planned series of music exclusives from the Sprint–Tidal partnership. For a short time, on July 2, the album was made available for free digital download in Tidal's site. A physical edition was released on July 7, including three additional tracks. On the same day, the album was made available to other streaming platforms, such as Apple Music, Google Play Music and Amazon Music. The album received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its emotional and personal content. On July 5, the album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), in recognition of one million copies purchased by Sprint and offered to consumers as free downloads.[123] It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, making it Jay-Z's 13th consecutive studio album to top the chart. The album spawned two singles, the title track \"4:44\" and \"Bam\", as well as several music videos, directed by a variety of high-profile collaborators. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Album of the Year, while the title track was nominated for Song of the Year and \"The Story of O.J.\" was nominated for Record of the Year at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.[124] On June 6, 2018, Jay-Z and Beyoncé kicked-off the On the Run II Tour in Cardiff, United Kingdom. Ten days later, at their final London performance, the pair unveiled Everything Is Love, their much-awaited joint studio album, credited under the name The Carters. The pair also released the video for the album's lead single, \"Apeshit\", on Beyoncé's official YouTube channel.[125][126] The song won two awards from eight nominations at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards.[127] In 2021, Jay-Z was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with fellow rapper LL Cool J.[128][129] He also appeared on the song \"Jail\" on Kanye West's 2021 album Donda,[130] which went on to win Grammy Award for Best Rap Song at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards[131] and on the song \"Love All\" from Drake's 2021 album Certified Lover Boy.[132] In 2022, his first feature was a collaboration with fellow rapper Pusha T, \"Neck & Wrist\" featuring Pharrell Williams from Pusha T's album, It's Almost Dry.[133] His feature was succeeded by a four-minute guest appearance on DJ Khaled's album title track, \"God Did\".[134][135] He also was awarded the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live), as a producer for the Super Bowl LVI halftime show.[136] Jay-Z says his earliest exposure to music was through his parents' record collection, which was mostly of soul artists such as Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway. He says \"I grew up around music, listening to all types of people... I'm into music that has soul in it, whether it be rap, R&B, pop music, whatever. As long as I can feel their soul through the wax, that's what I really listen to.\"[137] He often uses excerpts from these artists as samples in his work, particularly in the Kanye West productions included on The Blueprint.[137] Known for his lyrical prowess which often utilises double entendres, witty wordplays, and mixes messages with braggadocio, his music often describes his rise from poverty to vast wealth.[138][139][140][141][142] Royce da 5'9\" and Fredro Starr of Onyx both describe Jay-Z's emphasis on flow in the book How to Rap—Starr says that Jay-Z is \"a master of the flow—he can flow fast, he can flow slow\".[143] The book describes how Jay-Z uses 'rests' to provide structure to a verse[144] and how he uses 'partial linking' to add more rhymes to a verse.[145] Jay-Z's early style is described by Vibe as \"a distinctly Das EFX-type, stiggety style\" on his 12\" single \"Can't Get With That\",[146] referring to the fast rhythms and vocal delivery of the group Das EFX. He is also known to write lyrics in his head, as described by Pusha T of Clipse in How to Rap,[147] a style popular with many MCs such as The Notorious B.I.G.,[147] Everlast,[148] Bobby Creekwater[149] and Guerilla Black.[149] Shock G of Digital Underground describes Jay-Z's live performance style, saying he \"rarely breaks a sweat, and instead uses smoothness and clever wordplay to keep the audience interested and entertained\".[150] Jay-Z's fast rapping technique, also known as the \"triplet rhyme\", was developed during his early years of creating music with former mentor Jaz-O.[151][152] Jay-Z has also established himself as a successful entrepreneur with a business empire spanning a variety of industries from clothing lines, beverages, real estate, sport teams, and record labels.[153] In an interview, he stated that \"my brands are an extension of me. They're close to me. It's not like running GM, where there's no emotional attachment.\"[154] Jay-Z and Damon Dash are the founders of the urban clothing brand Rocawear.[155] Rocawear has clothing lines and accessories for men, women and children. The line was taken over by Jay-Z in early 2006 following a falling out with Dash. In March 2007, Jay-Z sold the rights to the Rocawear brand to Iconix Brand Group for $204 million. He retains his stake in the company and continues to oversee the marketing, licensing and product development.[155][156] Jay-Z became the first rapper in Reebok's history to endorse the company's footwear, signing a three-year endorsement deal.[157] He later appeared in a 2003 Reebok collection advertising his S. Carter Collection.[158] Later that year, he and frenemy 50 Cent appeared in a commercial to promote their S. Carter and G-Unit footwears for the company, with a Just Blaze-produced song made for it.[159] In 2006, Jay-Z's deal with Reebok expired with no renewal.[157] In 2014, Jay-Z invested $200 million in Armand de Brignac champagne—owned at the time by Sovereign Brands, a New York–based wine and spirits company—for a 100 percent stake, making it the second alcoholic product acquisition in his financial investment portfolio.[160][161] The brand is known for its popularity with high-profile artists as being the gold bottles often referred to in media.[162][163][164][165][166] His ties to the company date back to 2006, and he received millions of dollars per year for his association with Armand de Brignac before he bought the entire company.[167] Jay-Z serves as co-brand director for Budweiser Select and collaborates with the company on strategic marketing programs and creative ad development. He provides direction on brand programs and ads that appear on TV, radio, print, and high-profile events.[168] In March 2015, Jay-Z completed the $56 million acquisition of Aspiro, a Norwegian media technology company that operates the subscription-based music streaming service Tidal, which has been in operation since October 2014.[169] The music service was acquired through his company Project Panther Bidco Ltd. (an entity indirectly owned by Jay-Z's S. Carter Enterprises a company holding interests in leading international music, media and entertainment companies).[170][171] The music service combines audio and music videos with curated editorial. The main idea of the service is to bring major revenue streams back to the music artists themselves as the idea of an artist-owned streaming platform was stated as to \"restore the value to music by launching a service owned by artists.\" Jay-Z currently[when?] is a major shareholder in the company.[172][173] In July 2015, Carter made a significant investment to JetSmarter, an app helping people book private executive plane flights. The app was built by Sergey Petrossov.[174] From 2005 to 2007, Jay-Z was inaugurated as the president of Def Jam Recordings. Under Jay-Z's leadership, Def Jam launched the successful careers of contemporary R&B singers Rihanna and Ne-Yo. At the end of 2007, after he released American Gangster, Jay-Z decided not to renew his contract as the president and CEO of Def Jam. Shortly after, he started his Live Nation venture, Roc Nation.[175] In April 2011, it was reported that Jay-Z had outbid executives at Universal Music and Jive Records to acquire independent record label Block Starz Music.[176][177] For a decade (2003–2013), Jay-Z enjoyed his role as a part-owner of the Brooklyn Nets NBA team, having paid a reported $1 million for his share, which declined in value to $350,000 in April 2013, based on Forbes magazine's valuation of the team.[178] He encouraged the team's relocation to Brooklyn's Barclays Center (from New Jersey) in the 2012–2013 season, at which point the team took on the Brooklyn Nets moniker.[179][180] On April 18, 2013, Jay-Z officially announced through his Life + Times website in a press release that he would be relinquishing his ownership in the Brooklyn Nets.[181] The shares were eventually sold to singer, rapper, actor and entrepreneur Will Pan, making Pan the first American of Taiwanese descent to own a U.S. professional sports franchise.[182][183] Jay-Z's cited Pan's athletic background (he was a team captain of his high school basketball team and played in college), his multitude of musical styles, his influence in the Taiwanese American community, and his business acumen and portfolio (including being the founder and chief executive of software company Camigo Media and a co-founder of streetwear boutique N.P.C [New Project Center]), as reasons why his bid was successful.[182][183] In September 2013, his stake in Barclays Center was sold for $1.5 million.[184] On April 2, 2013, ESPN reported Jay-Z's plans to launch his own sports agency, Roc Nation Sports, with a focus on the representation of various professional athletes. The sport management group is a partnership with Creative Artists Agency.[185] In conjunction with the agency's launch, New York Yankees's second baseman Robinson Canó left agent Scott Boras to sign with the company. ESPN also mentioned that Jay-Z himself was planning to be a certified sports agent, first in baseball and eventually in basketball and football. In order to represent clients in basketball, he would have to give up his small share of the Brooklyn Nets.[185][186] In October 2005, he was reported in English media as considering buying a stake of Arsenal F.C., an English soccer team.[187] Through his conglomerate company Gain Global Investments Network LLC, he had an interest estimated between 2 and 7% in the Aqueduct Entertainment Group (AEG) consortium, which in January 2010 was awarded a contract to operate a 4,500-slot-machine racino at the Aqueduct Race Track. Jay-Z became interested in the project after New York Governor David Paterson who awarded the contract said there had to be an affirmative action component to the ownership. Jay-Z was initially approached by casino mogul Steve Wynn, who was also bidding on the contract. On March 9, 2010, Jay-Z and Flake withdrew from the project, and Paterson recused himself from further involvement.[188][189] On April 5, 2011, Jay-Z launched the popular culture and lifestyle online magazine Life + Times. It features content that showcases his high-end tastes in clothing, appliances, and cars. The site design is aesthetically aimed at the upwardly mobile young male demographic, with sports and music-related posts accompanying those about fashion and design.[190] Among the music content is the Decoded series, originating from Jay-Z's memoir of the same name and featuring a select rapper deciphering their own lyrics.[191] In January 2015, after being contacted by the webzine, the DJ and radio host Funkmaster Flex revealed that he had been contacted in 2013 for a story about a digital app he made at the time, but alleged that the information was instead used to help launch the Magna Carta Samsung app for the release of Jay-Z's album of the same name. \"But I was good with that. I ate that. Everybody's out here hustling\", Flex reasoned to Vibe.[192] In 2016, he signed a two-year exclusive film and TV Deal with Weinstein Company and with the deal gives them first-look options to create scripted and unscripted TV projects and film projects, and those projects were in works.[193] As part of his deal with Weinstein company, he produced a documentary series on the life of Kalief Browder who was imprisoned for three years and committed suicide upon his release. He also addressed racial profiling and police brutality in a conscious manner.[194] Jay-Z also co-owns the 40/40 Club, an upscale sports bar that started in New York City, and has since expanded to Atlantic City and Chicago. In 2008, the 40/40 Club in Las Vegas was closed down and bought back by the hotel after attendance steadily declined.[195] In 2005, Jay-Z became an investor in Carol's Daughter, a line of beauty products, including products for hair, skin, and hands.[196] In 2010, he announced plans to expand his 40/40 Club sports bar chain into as many as 20 airports, joining his Roc Nation business partners, husband and wife Juan and Desiree Perez, in a deal with Delaware North.[197] On November 16, 2010, Jay-Z published a memoir entitled Decoded.[198][199] The memoir was co-signed by Dream Hampton.[200] Parlux fragrances sued Jay-Z for $18 million for the failure of his cologne, Gold. They claim the cologne's failure is due to Jay-Z not doing social media posts and interviews about the cologne. Parlux claims they projected selling $15 million the first year, and $35 million the second, and subsequent years after the launch. The fragrance sold $14 million the first year and $6.1 million the second.[201] Parlux lost money on the venture and have had constant returns of unsold inventory.[202] Jay-Z collaborated with Cohiba to launch his own cigars.[203] In August 2020, Jay-Z's Roc Nation partnered with Brooklyn's Long Island University to establish the Roc Nation School of Music, Sports & Entertainment.[204] In November 2020, it was announced that Jay-Z would be join TPCO Holding Corp., a newly formed cannabis products company, in the role of \"Chief Visionary Officer\".[205] On December 5, 2022, Jay-Z and the Roc Nation announced their partnership with Caesars Entertainment to build and operate a casino property at Times Square.[206] In 2002, Jay-Z and singer Beyoncé collaborated on the song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\". He also appeared on Beyoncé's hit single, \"Crazy in Love\" the following year, as well as the song \"That's How You Like It\" from her debut album Dangerously in Love (2003). On her second album, B'Day, he made appearances on the hits \"Déjà Vu\" and \"Upgrade U\". In the video for the latter song, she comically imitates his appearance.[207] They kept a low profile while dating, and were married on April 4, 2008, in a private ceremony in Tribeca, New York City.[208] Their relationship became a matter of public record on April 22, 2008,[209] although Beyoncé did not publicly debut her US$5 million Lorraine Schwartz-designed wedding ring until the Fashion Rocks concert on September 5, 2008.[210] Since their marriage, they generally avoid discussing their relationship,[211] and Beyoncé has stated her belief that this has helped them, while Jay-Z agreed in a People article that they do not \"play with [their] relationship\".[212] In 2006, Beyoncé and Jay-Z were listed as the most powerful couple for Time magazine's 100 most influential people.[213] In January 2009, Forbes ranked them as Hollywood's top-earning couple, with a combined total of $162 million.[214] They made it to the top of the list the following year, with a combined total of US$122 million between June 2008 and June 2009.[214] At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé revealed that she was pregnant with their first child.[215][216] Their daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, was born at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital on January 7, 2012.[217] Jay-Z released \"Glory\", a song dedicated to Blue Ivy, through his Life+Times website on January 9, 2012.[218] The song, produced by frequent collaborators the Neptunes, detailed the couple's pregnancy struggles, including a miscarriage Beyoncé had suffered.[218] Blue Ivy's cries were included at the end of the song, and she was officially credited on the song as \"B.I.C\"; she became the youngest person in Billboard history (at two days old) have a chart entry when \"Glory\" debuted at No. 74 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.[219] On June 18, 2017, Beyoncé's father Mathew Knowles confirmed that she had given birth to twins with Jay-Z, a daughter named Rumi and a son named Sir.[220] In the following months, they purchased a US$88 million home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles.[221] In 2023, the couple bought a house in Malibu, California, designed by the architect Tadao Ando, for $200 million. It established a record for the most expensive residence sold in California.[222] On December 2, 1999, Jay-Z, who had come to believe that record executive Lance \"Un\" Rivera was behind the bootlegging of Vol. 3..., allegedly stabbed him at the Kit Kat Klub, a now-defunct night club in Times Square, New York City, during a release party for Q-Tip's album Amplified.[223] Jay-Z's associates at the party were accused of causing a commotion within the club, which Jay-Z allegedly used as cover while he stabbed Rivera in the stomach with a five-inch (127 mm) blade.[224] He surrendered to police the following evening and was placed under arrest, although he was soon released on $50,000 bail.[225][226] When he was indicted in Manhattan Criminal Court in late January 2000, he pleaded not guilty; he and his lawyers contended that they had witnesses and videotapes proving he had been nowhere near Rivera during the incident. Nevertheless, he later pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and accepted a three-year probation sentence.[227] Jay-Z later addressed the case in his 2010 book Decoded: One night I went to Q-Tip's solo album release party and at some point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I approached him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, \"No the fuck this nigga did not...\" I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted. [...] There was no reason to put my life on the line, and the lives of everyone who depends on me, because of a momentary loss of control. [...] I vowed to never allow myself to be in a situation like that again.[228] In 2023, Rivera stated that Jay-Z lied, and was not the one that stabbed him: “No. Jay-Z was not the guy that actually stabbed me that night (...) it’s never been his history”.[229][230][231] In December 2024, Jay-Z, along with Sean Combs, was accused in a civil lawsuit of raping a 13-year-old girl at an MTV Video Music Awards after-party in 2000. Jay-Z denied the allegations and described it as a blackmail attempt.[232] During his first retirement from music,[failed verification] Jay-Z became involved in philanthropy. In 2003, along with his mother, Jay-Z founded the Shawn Carter Foundation, which assists eligible students facing socio-economic hardships attend and get through college.[233] In August 2006, he met with Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General of the United Nations at the organization's New York City headquarters, where he pledged to use his upcoming world tour to raise awareness of the global water shortage, a challenge he learned about following a visit to Africa by Bono, the lead singer of U2.[234] The effort took place in partnership with the UN,[235] as well as MTV, which produced a documentary entitled Diary of Jay-Z: Water for Life, first airing in November 2006.[236] Along with Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Jay-Z pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross's relief effort after Hurricane Katrina.[237] Jay-Z supported Kanye West after West's outburst against President George W. Bush during a live Katrina charity telethon.[238] He also addressed the Katrina disaster and the federal government's response in his one-verse song \"Minority Report\".[239] Jay-Z has said that \"the greatest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous\". In 2013, author dream hampton, who co-wrote Jay-Z's book Decoded, revealed that Jay-Z had established a trust fund for Sean Bell's children.[240] Jay-Z donated to bail out protestors arrested during 2015 activism against police brutality.[241][242] In March 2020, Jay-Z donated $1 million through the Shawn Carter Foundation to aid in relief during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York.[243] In April 2020, along with Meek Mill, he donated over 100,000 face masks to U.S. prisons to assist in protecting prison inmates from COVID-19.[244] In 2006, Jay-Z appeared with Russell Simmons in a public service announcement denouncing racism and anti-Semitism, sponsored by the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding.[245] In 2008, Jay-Z was involved in the 2008 United States presidential election, supporting enhanced voter participation.[246] He supported the 2008 presidential candidacy of Barack Obama and performed voter-drive concerts financed by the Democrats' campaign.[247] He also became acquainted with Obama, who in June 2008 said, \"Every time I talk to Jay-Z, who is a brilliant talent and a good guy, I enjoy how he thinks. That's somebody who is going to start branching out and can help shape attitudes in a real positive way.\"[248] During the 2010 mid-term elections, Jay-Z appeared with other artists in a HeadCount advertisement, urging voters, especially younger ones, to register and vote.[249] In May 2012, Jay-Z endorsed President Obama's support of same-sex marriage[250] and participated in his re-election campaign.[251] Musician and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte was critical of Jay-Z and Beyoncé for what he saw as their safe political stances, saying that they \"have turned their back on social responsibility\".[252] In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Jay-Z and Beyoncé appeared at a Hillary Clinton rally in Cleveland.[253] Clinton praised Jay-Z for addressing racism, oppression, and the criminal justice system.[254] He described Donald Trump as a \"superbug\" and condemned remarks he perceived as racist,[255] but later said that Trump's rhetoric forced people to come together and address difficult issues such as white privilege.[256] Solo studio albums Collaborative albums In 2006, he was enstooled as the Sarkin Waka of Kwara in the Nigerian chieftaincy system.[263]",

                "content": "Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), known professionally as Jay-Z (stylized as JAY-Z),[a] is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, record executive, actor, and entrepreneur. He is the former CEO of Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z co-owns The 40/40 Club and the Brooklyn Nets NBA team. He is one of the most financially successful hip-hop artists and businessmen in America.[8] Jay-Z has several nicknames, \"Jigga\", \"Hova\" and \"El Presidente\". In June 2019, it was reported that Jay-Z had become the first billionaire rapper.[9] Jay-Z was born as Shawn Corey Carter in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. He was raised in Marcy Houses, a housing project in Brooklyn's Bedford–Stuyvesant. After their father Adnis Reeves abandoned the family, Jay-Z and his three siblings were raised by their mother, Gloria Carter. Reeves would later meet and reconcile with Jay-Z shortly before dying in 2003. Jay-Z claims in his lyrics that in 1982, at age 12, he shot his older brother in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry. Along with rapper AZ he attended Eli Whitney High School in Brooklyn until it was closed. He then attended nearby George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School with rappers The Notorious B.I.G. and Busta Rhymes, followed by a stint at Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey, though he did not graduate. According to his interviews and lyrics, he sold crack cocaine and was shot at three times during this period. According to his mother, Jay-Z used to wake up his siblings at night banging out drum patterns on the kitchen table. She bought him a boombox for his birthday, sparking his interest in music, and he began freestyling and writing lyrics. Known as \"Jazzy\" around the neighborhood, he later adopted the stage name \"Jay-Z\" in homage to his mentor Jaz-O. Jay-Z can be briefly heard on several of Jaz-O's early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \"H. P. Gets Busy\", \"The Originators\" and \"Hawaiian Sophie\". Jay-Z became embroiled in several battles with rapper LL Cool J in the early 1990s. He first became known to a wide audience on the posse cut \"Show and Prove\" on the 1994 Big Daddy Kane album Daddy's Home. Jay-Z has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane's hype man during this period, although Kane explains that he did not fill the traditional hype man role, and was instead basically making cameo appearances on stage. \"When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage.\" The young Jay-Z appeared on a popular song by Big L, \"Da Graveyard\", and on Mic Geronimo's \"Time to Build\", which also featured early appearances by DMX and Ja Rule in 1995. His first official rap single was called \"In My Lifetime\", for which he released a music video in 1995. An unreleased music video was also produced for the B-side \"I Can't Get with That.\" In 2003, Jay-Z stopped rapping, because he found that there were not enough good rappers to compete with him. He said that the game was too easy for him. He decided to concentrate more on his producer career than his rap career. He became the president of Def Jam Recordings. He signed a lot of great artists such as Rihanna, Ne-Yo and Kanye West. He also became a businessman by creating his own clothing company, Rocawear, and owning a part of the Brooklyn Nets, an NBA basketball team. After a step back in his career, he made a decision in 2006 to come back into the game. He created the albums \"Kingdom Came\" and the year after \"American Gangster\". In 2009, he released Blue print 3, but in 2011 he teamed up with Kanye West to do an LP called Watch the Throne. This album went triple hit, made the top rap charts for August and also nominated for the Grammy for the best rap Album. Now, he is known to be one of the best rappers of all time. In April 2011 Jay-Z started a website called Life+ Times. He also took part in Barack Obama’s last elections.[10] Jay-Z's twelfth album, Magna Carta Holy Grail, was released in July 2013. The album topped the chart to number one. It was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards. The first single on the album, \"Holy Grail\", features Justin Timberlake singing in it. It reached number four on the US Billboard 100.[11] In South Korea it reached number one. Jay-Z's wife Beyoncé sings on \"Part II (On the Run)\". In December 2013 Jay-Z was nominated for nine Grammy Awards. This was more than anyone else that year.[12] He rapped on his wife Beyoncé Knowles' fifth album Beyoncé. Together with Beyoncé, Jay-Z has three children: daughter Blue Ivy (born January 7th, 2012)[13] and twins Rumi and Sir Carter.[14] JAY-Z has released the following albums during his career:",

                "content": "If your child tells you he wants to be a famous rapper, tell him he should be paying lots of attention in English class. In a recent interview with David Letterman, Jay-Z credited his sixth grade English teacher with fueling his love of language: “Her name was Ms. Lowden, and I just loved the class so much. Like reading the dictionary, and my love of words — I just connected with her.” The Washington Post recently found Ms. Lowden and asked her about her now famous student, whom she knew as Shawn Carter. “The thing I remember about Shawn is he took the reading test and he scored 12th grade in the sixth grade,” Rosenblum-Lowden recalled. “And I remember telling him — because I really feel it’s important to tell kids they’re smart — I said, ‘You’re smart, you better do well.’ And he listened.” According to the Washington Post article, found here, they connected over one of Rosenblum-Lowden’s favorite lessons, in which she would ask the class a question using a word that was likely beyond their vocabulary. To answer the question — to even understand it — the students had to use a dictionary. She would ask things such as “What does a loquacious person like to do?” and the students would “have to look it up to answer it.” A few great lessons here. First, it’s important to note that Jay-Z’s lyrical skills grew out of his strong intellect and advanced reading ability. (Reading at the twelfth grade level in 6th grade is very impressive!) Let those aspiring rappers in your household know that reading well and having an extensive vocabulary are keys to rapping well. Second, here is a prime example of how great teachers can make all the difference in the world. Ms. Rosenblum-Lowden saw how bright young Jay-Z was and made sure that he knew it, and that he knew her high expectations of him. She taught him to use and appreciate the dictionary. She connected with him. And that connection still matters to him after all these years. Third, that dictionary game worked, and parents should try that at home. Ask questions using “big” words when you talk to your little ones, and have them find out what the words mean in order to answer the questions. They may head for their dictionary app on their phones rather than an actual dictionary, but that’s fine, as long as they get the answers right. Kudos to Ms. Lowden for being a good and caring English teacher. And kudos to Jay-Z for giving his English teacher the credit she deserved!

                "title": "Las Vegas Raiders vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Live Score and Stats - December 8, 2024 Gametracker - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. TAMPA, Fla. (AP) The surging Tampa Bay Buccaneers are back over .500, a fourth straight NFC South title within reach. Now, they hope to finish the task by building on a three-game winning streak that's propelled them to the top of the division following a stretch in which they lost five of six games. “It's one thing getting to first place. It's a whole other thing staying there,” coach Todd Bowles said after Sunday's sloppy 28-13 win over the reeling Las Vegas Raiders. “We've got four games left. It's going to be a battle all the way through. We have to come ready every week.” Baker Mayfield threw for 295 yards and three touchdowns, and the Bucs won for the third straight week against a last-place opponent to move ahead of fading Atlanta in the NFC South. The Falcons, who hold a tiebreaker advantage after sweeping the season series between the rivals, have lost four in a row. “It doesn't have to be pretty. Obviously, there are a lot of things that I would personally like to have back, but it's a resilient group. We play for each other,” Mayfield said. “Guys step up when other people go down and that's what football is all about. It teaches you life lessons.” Mayfield tossed scoring passes of 15 yards and 29 yards to rookie Jalen McMillan. Rachaad White scored on a 5-yard reception and a 3-yard run for the Bucs, who pulled away in the second half after the Raiders (2-11) lost quarterback Aidan O'Connell to a knee injury that coach Antonio Pierce said “doesn't look good.” O’Connell was carted off the field after being shoved to the ground by Bucs defensive lineman Calijah Kancey after throwing a pass late in the third quarter. The quarterback, in his second game back after being sidelined nearly six weeks with a broken thumb, remained on the ground after an 8-yard, third-down completion to Jakobi Meyers. Kancey chased O’Connell out of the pocket toward the Bucs sideline and shoved him from behind after the ball was released. Kancey was not penalized for a late hit. “Prayers to him. I pray for a speedy recovery,” Kancey said. “I hope everything's good on their end. I definitely took a knee and prayed for him.” White rushed for 90 yards on 17 carries. His TD run in the fourth quarter put Tampa Bay up 21-10. McMillan's second TD finished an 80-yard drive and put the game out of reach after Desmond Ridder led the Raiders to a field goal that got Las Vegas within 21-13 with three minutes remaining. The Raiders have lost an NFL-high nine straight games. “I appreciate the effort, the grit, the fight,” Pierce said. “Listen, it's tough. And these guys, they're not flinching or blinking. They still believe. ... All of those guys are fighting until the very end. Proud of the effort.” Mayfield turned the ball over three times in the first half to help the Raiders stay close. O'Connell fumbled one play after Mayfield tossed his first interception. But four plays later, Raiders linebacker Amari Burney sacked Mayfield, forcing a fumble that led to O'Connell's 1-yard TD run that trimmed Tampa Bay's early lead to 14-7. The fumble recovery by Tre'von Moehrig was the first by the Las Vegas defense this season. Jack Jones' end zone interception denied Mayfield an opportunity to build on a 14-10 lead just before halftime. Raiders tight end Brock Bowers, who began the day leading the NFL in receptions with 84, had three catches for 49 yards and broke Sam LaPorta's year-old record for receptions in a season by a rookie tight end. LaPorta had 86 catches for the Detroit Lions in 2023. \"It’s cool, but it would be cooler with some more wins,” Bowers said. “He’s having a great individual year,” Pierce added. “I wish it could lead to more success for our team.” Raiders: O'Connell left the game with 1:23 remaining in the third quarter and was replaced by Ridder. O'Connell finished 11 of 19 passing 104 yards and an interception. He was sacked once. Buccaneers: Played without LB K.J. Britt (ankle), S Mike Edwards (hamstring), CB Josh Hayes (hamstring) and OLB Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (ankle). S Antoine Winfield Jr. (knee) and RB Bucky Irving (back) left in the second quarter and did not return. WR Ryan Miller (concussion) departed in the fourth quarter.

After a goalless draw in the first leg, America took a 2-0 lead in the semifinal courtesy of goals either side of halftime from Alejandro Zendejas and Richard Sanchez. Ignacio Rivero reduced the deficit with a 68th-minute strike, before Ramon Juarez restored the visitor's two-goal buffer by nodding home after Alvaro Fidalgo's corner. A Gabriel Fernandez header and a stunning long-range effort from Amaury Morales saw the host draw level four minutes from time. But America refused to surrender and Aguirre held his nerve from the spot after Erick Sanchez was brought down by Carlos Rotondi. The fourth official added 12 minutes of stoppage time and Aguirre went from hero to villain when he was sent off in the 98th minute for a bad foul on Gonzalo Piovi. But the Eagles held on to maintain hopes of a third straight Liga MX title and the 16th in its history. America will meet Monterrey in the two-legged final next Thursday and Sunday. ■",

                "title": "Chelsea (given name) - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Chelsea is an English given name derived from the Old English place name ċealc hȳð,[1] or the modern Celcyth, meaning chalk landing place. The name evolved to Chelsea, a location on the River Thames that became a London borough known for its wealthy, socially influential residents. Many locations have been named after the English place name Chelsea.[2] The given name, a transferred use of the place name, was in use for boys in the New England region of the United States by the late 18th century and was first used for American girls in the 1840s.[2] The name was first popularized for girls in larger numbers in the United States by American comedian Chelsea Brown, who was born Lois Brown but chose Chelsea as a stage name. After Brown began appearing on the American television program Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In in 1968, the name quadrupled in use for American girls to 48 uses that year. The name debuted among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 1969, in 702nd place. Chelsea Morning, a 1969 hit song written about mornings in Chelsea, Manhattan by Canadian singer Joni Mitchell and later performed by Judy Collins, further popularized the name for girls with its descriptive lyrics such as \"the light poured in like butterscotch.\"[2] The name of Chelsea Clinton, daughter of American President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, was inspired by the song when she was born in 1980. The name Chelsea increased further in popularity in the 1980s due to its use for film and television characters, such as Chelsea Thayer Wayne, a character played by Jane Fonda in the 1981 American film On Golden Pond and Chelsea Reardon, a character played by Kassie DePaiva on the American soap opera Guiding Light beginning in 1986. In 1992, the name reached peak popularity in the United States and would have been the eighth most popular name for American girls in that year if all spellings of the name were combined. The name dramatically declined in use in 1993, during the first year of Bill Clinton's presidency. At the time, it was out of fashion in the United States to name children after politicians and those who were associated with them. The name has continued to decline in use, but remained among the 1,000 most popular names for American girls in 2023.[2] Spelling variants in use in the United States include Chelsey, Chelsi, Chelsie, and Chelsy.[2] The name has also been in regular use throughout the Anglosphere, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, as well as in Belgium, France and Netherlands.[3]",

The name was used most in 1992, when it was at #15 in the United States on the USA Social Security Administration baby naming chart.[3] The name might come from the Old English language and mean \"chalk landing place\".

                "content": "Senior Editor MINNEAPOLIS — One, two three. Four. Five! Sam Darnold threw a career-high five touchdown passes, finding Jordan Addison (for three scores) and Justin Jefferson (for two), as well as multiple explosive plays in a 42-21 Vikings victory Sunday over the Atlanta Falcons. Darnold also set new career highs in passing yards (347) and passer rating (157.9) in a game, and although an NFL max passer rating is 158.3, it's hard to imagine anyone playing better than Darnold did. He completed 22 of 28 passes and withstood seven hits, four sacks and multiple other pressures caused by the Falcons (6-7). Addison finished with 133 yards and three touchdowns on eight receptions. He also drew a 47-yard pass interference penalty in the first half. Jefferson posted 132 yards and two scores — his first two trips to the paint since Week 7, helping Minnesota improve to 11-2 on the season. View game action photos from the Vikings vs. Falcons matchup in Week 14 at U.S. Bank Stadium. The Vikings aerial attack flew high against a Falcons squad led by former Minnesota QB Kirk Cousins (2018-23), who visited U.S. Bank Stadium for the first time since signing with Atlanta in the offseason. Attendance for the game was announced at 67,008, which is the second-largest for a Vikings game at the venue that opened in 2016. The only game with more in attendance was the 2019 Border Battle, so intrigue was high with the matchup. Cousins opened the game 4-of-5 passing with the only incompletion a drop on his first attempt. He followed with completions of 28 yards to Darnell Mooney on third-and-8 and 16 to Drake London on second-and-15. With goal-to-go, the Falcons kept it on the ground, and Tyler Allgeier rumbled for a 6-yard touchdown. Cousins finished 23-of-37 passing for 344 yards with no touchdowns, two interceptions and a passer rating of 70.1. Darnold's first pass of the day was batted at the line of scrimmage, but he followed with a 16-yard strike to Jordan Addison on third-and-5. Minnesota's first possession, however, was upended after the Vikings advanced to the Falcons 37-yard line. Darnold was sacked by Eddie Goldman and Arnold Ebiketie on consecutive plays. But as he's shown multiple times, he bounced back, and so did the Vikings through a couple of rough patches to seize control in the fourth quarter. Here are four more observations presented by Minnesota Eye Consultants, the Proud LASIK Partner of the Minnesota Vikings, followed by a scoring summary: 1. Metellus & Murphy also catch footballs Joshua Metellus was able to record his fourth career interception and second of 2024. Metellus stepped in front of a pass intended for London early in the second quarter shortly after Minnesota tied the gam at 7 on a 49-yard touchdown to Addison. Although the ensuing drive resulted in a punt, the pick was helpful in swaying momentum for an early surge. Byron Murphy, Jr., continued showing his spectacular hands so good that he only needed one to spear a pass by Cousins just shy of the end zone. It protected a 35-21 lead with 6:26 remaining in the game. It was the sixth pick of the season for Murphy. 2. Special teams offers biggest swing The Vikings scored early in the fourth quarter on an 11-yard touchdown from Darnold to Addison to make it 28-21 with 12:59 remaining. Atlanta returned and fumbled the ensuing kickoff. Brian Asamoah II hit Ray-Ray McCloud III after a 31-yard takeback (the only one attempted by the Falcons), and C.J. Ham, who was recognized during the game as the Vikings nominee for the 2024 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, pounded on the football at the Atlanta 32. Minnesota's lead surged to 35-21 seven plays later with another touchdown to Addison. View pregame photos as the Vikings get set for the Week 14 matchup against the Falcons at U.S. Bank Stadium. 3. On the ground game The Vikings built their lead by throwing the ball and closed out the victory by running it. Minnesota drove 98 yards for its final touchdown, which included a 25-yard run by Cam Akers and finished with a 15-yard rushing touchdown by Aaron Jones, Sr. Jones led Minnesota with 73 rushing yards on 13 carries, and Akers added 37 on five. Atlanta showed its strength in the run game with Bijan Robinson rushing 22 times for 92 yards and Allgeier adding 63 yards on nine rushes. Each scored a touchdown. 4. Reichard returns Vikings kicker Will Reichard (and long snapper Andrew DePaola) returned from Injured Reserve because of injuries that each suffered against Indianapolis. Reichard went 6-for-6 on extra points, but his lone field goal try of the day hit the left upright. The kick was from 47. © 2023 Minnesota Vikings Football, LLC , All Rights Reserved.",

                "content": "Falcons Digital Team Reporter MINNEAPOLIS —All the storylines surrounding the Week 14 game between the Atlanta Falcons and Minnesota Vikings came to a close Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium, but it wasn't the ending the visiting team needed. Final score: 42-21 Why it's important: The Falcons now drop below the 0.500 mark with a 6-7 record, and their current slide extends to four games. Since the Tampa Bay Buccaneers also won Sunday, defeating the Las Vegas Raiders, the Falcons are no longer in the NFC South lead. The Buccaneers' 7-6 record puts them in sole possession of first place entering Week 15. Key takeaway: Turnovers really ruined any chance of the Falcons beating the Vikings. More: The Falcons had three turnovers – one fumble and two interceptions — all in timely moments. The first pick came as the score was tied, preventing the Falcons from pulling ahead. The fumble led to a Vikings' touchdown that put the home team up by two scores. And the second pick set up another Vikings touchdown. Minnesota cashed in 14 points on three turnovers. Key moment: The Falcons fumbled away the opportunity to answer a Vikings' touchdown. More: The Vikings took a 28-21 lead early in the fourth quarter with an 11-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Sam Darnold to wide receiver Justin Jefferson. On the following kickoff, Falcons wide receiver Ray-Ray McCloud III fumbled the ball after returning it 31 yards. Vikings linebacker Brian Asamoah II was credited with the force and fullback C.J. Ham with the recovery at the Atlanta 32-yard line. The Vikings' offense was then back on the field and compiled a seven-play scoring drive. Darnold completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jordan Addison, putting the Vikings ahead by two scores. Of course, the Falcons then got another chance to at least cut into the Vikings' advantage. But Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins was intercepted during the next drive, diminishing Atlanta's shot at a comeback. Standout performance: The Falcons' defense had four sacks against Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold, proving the unit could essentially repeat its five-sack performance from last week's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. Sunday's count came from inside linebacker Kaden Elliss, defensive lineman Eddie Goldman, outside linebackers Matthew Judon and Arnold Ebiketie. The Falcons really used the bye in Week 12 to self-scout and improve this area of their defensive performance. Number to know: 0. The number of touchdown passes Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins threw. For the fourth consecutive game, Cousins failed to find the end zone through the air. This extends his career-long drought. Instead, he threw two interceptions, giving him eight picks in the last four games. A quick tweet: The Falcons editorial staff of Tori McElhaney, Will McFadden, Terrin Waack and Amna Subhan share their gut reactions to Sunday's outcome in 280 characters or less. Settling the storylines: Looking forward: The Falcons have a longer week of preparation ahead since they're scheduled for the Week 15 Monday Night Football game on Dec. 16 at 8:30 p.m. ET. Atlanta will play the Las Vegas Raiders at Allegiant Stadium.

                "title": "Vikings vs. Falcons takeaways: Sam Darnold throws five TDs, Kirk Cousins picked twice as Minnesota rolls - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. MINNEAPOLIS -- Kirk Cousins started hot in his return to U.S. Bank Stadium, helping the Atlanta Falcons score first in Sunday's anticipated matchup with the Minnesota Vikings, who employed the big-money quarterback for more than a half-decade. Cousins' homecoming went much better for his old team, however, as the Vikings picked him off twice and got a career-high five touchdown passes from Sam Darnold, cruising to a 42-21 victory that keeps them among the top contenders in the NFC playoff race. Atlanta had spurts of explosive offense on the road, with Bijan Robinson and Tyler Allgeier each breaking off key runs, and both Darnell Mooney and Ray-Ray McCloud corralling deep balls from Cousins. The Vikings secondary made up for it with a pair of picks, however, and Kevin O'Connell's attack did the rest, averaging more than 8 yards per play deep into the fourth quarter, with both Jordan Addison and Justin Jefferson hauling in seven passes for 130+ yards and two scores. Darnold, in particular, was sharp as ever, keeping his eyes downfield despite some occasional heat from Raheem Morris' defensive front. Here are some major takeaways from Sunday's showdown: Sam Darnold had himself a showcase performance, and his 52-yard bomb to Jefferson was especially spicy, considering he shook away several pass rushers before launching it deep: Seven of Minnesota's previous eight wins were one-score decisions, and many of them came against iffy opponents (i.e. the entire AFC South). Sunday was a different story, with the club finally breaking away in crunch time, and O'Connell's offense never really taking its foot off the gas. The Falcons might just be another mediocre opponent (more on that below), but the fact the Vikings left with such a convincing win, with both sides of the ball stepping up with splash plays, suggests this group is actually a better representative of its impressive 11-2 record than many realized. Sam Darnold's little turnover spree earlier this year feels like a distant memory, and he's now been playing top-10 ball for much of his Vikings debut. Throw in the talent at his disposal out wide, plus Brian Flores' unit's undying penchant for timely takeaways, and maybe NFC North rivals like the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers have real reason to worry about their purple foes down the stretch. After all, thanks to their sixth straight win on Sunday, the Vikings are still just a single game back from the Lions for the conference's No. 1 seed. To be clear, the NFC South is ugly enough that Atlanta can't be fully written off as potential division champions, even considering their latest defeat. But the Falcons, who flashed against the rival Tampa Bay Buccaneers on multiple occasions, are sinking in large part because of their commitment to Cousins. Yes, the quarterback had a few nice touch passes on his old stomping grounds, but he also had two more picks -- both of which could've benefited from his usual passing velocity from the pocket. That means he's up to eight picks and zero touchdowns in the Falcons' 0-4 stretch; while he's clearly still capable of shepherding drives, the finishing touch -- the \"it\" factor -- just hasn't been there, and it may well derail their chances of making any kind of real run. Bijan Robinson and Tyler Allgeier and Drake London and Darnell Mooney have all been respectable weapons at certain times, but the offense as a whole has struggled too often when it counts. And that's saying nothing of Raheem Morris' defense, which got torched on the back end while up against the Vikings' pass catchers. Even standout veterans like Jessie Bates looked lost in coverage. Barring a drastic turnaround, this group appears headed for a second-place finish in an ugly division. The Vikings (11-2) will stay at home to host a Monday night matchup with the rival Chicago Bears in Week 15. The Falcons (6-7) will look to avoid a fifth straight defeat when they travel to play the Las Vegas Raiders, who fell to the Buccaneers on Sunday. The Vikings are moving to 11-2: Atlanta is headed for its fourth straight loss, as Kirk Cousins sends one deep toward Kyle Pitts, only for Byron Murphy Jr. to snag a pick one-handed. Ugly throw after a decent drive with some nice plays by Darnell Mooney and Ray-Ray McCloud. And it'll all but wrap this one up in Minnesota's favor. Talk about stealing the spotlight from Minnesota's old quarterback: Sam Darnold hits Jordan Addison on a slant, and it's an easy third score for the second-year pass catcher. This one might be in the bag. Sam Darnold is delivering some Pro Bowl-caliber darts in this one, now up to four passing scores on the afternoon. His latest: an 11-yard zinger to Jordan Addison, who's now reached the end zone twice against Atlanta. The young wideout is up to 118 yards on six catches, teaming up with Justin Jefferson (6-125-1) to shred the Falcons secondary. One drive after the Vikings seem to blow the game open with another Sam Darnold bomb, the Falcons strike back just like that: Tyler Allegeier jumpstarts the series with a bullish run after shaking off a hard hit from Josh Metellus, then Kirk Cousins deals against soft coverage and Bijan Robinson finishes the job, surging up the gut for both a touchdown and two-point conversion. We've got ourselves a tie ballgame, 21-21. Kirk who? Sam Darnold escapes pocket pressure, rolls right, and despite a clear lane to run for the first down against Atlanta, he keeps his eyes downfield and launches one to Justin Jefferson, who couldn't be more wide open working against the Falcons secondary. It's a 52-yard score, and all of a sudden the Vikings feel in control on their own turf, now up 21-13: Andrew Van Ginkel nearly jumps a Kirk Cousins pass, threatening to log his third pick-six of the season, but the Falcons retain possession and close their drive with a 29-yard Younghoe Koo field goal. It's 14-13. Kirk Cousins has engineered a couple of long, methodical drives, but Atlanta has struggled to finish series. Kirk Cousins darts one to Drake London, and the ball initially appears to be picked by Shaq Griffin, who steps just in front of the wideout to make the play. But the two go to the ground with seemingly equal control of the rock, and the officials then rule it a catch for London. Kevin O'Connell proceeds to challenge the call, but the refs confirm the decision; not really sure what O'Connell expected to gain from such a tossup call to begin with, though some replays appeared to show London having just one hand on the ball at the time the two sides went to the ground. Back from injury, Will Reichard can't connect, with his field goal banging off the left upright, failing to give Minnesota a seven-point lead. The Falcons' pass rush has been a highlight for Atlanta's defense, with seven tackles for loss and four sacks so far. This is still anyone's game. Younghoe Koo caps a 68-yard drive with a 20-yard kick, and we've got a 14-10 ballgame. If you're the Falcons, you wish you could've finished with more: Kirk Cousins had a perfect deep shot to Darnell Mooney, who easily beat Shaq Griffin with his speed to clear 100 yards on the day, but the red-zone rushing game didn't deliver. We're headed to the break with Minnesota on top. So the Falcons' defensive holding comes back to bite them: The Vikings get a fresh set of downs instead of settling for three, and Sam Darnold delivers a strike across the middle to Jefferson. It's a 12-yard score, with the star wideout beating Dee Alford while slanting into the end zone. The officials call a delayed holding penalty on Atlanta during the Vikings' short field goal try, so the points are wiped off the board and Minnesota gets a fresh set of downs deep in Falcons territory. It's 7-7 again, but Sam Darnold and Co. have another shot to punch it into the end zone. The pressure finally gets to Sam Darnold, with Arnold Ebiketie contacting the quarterback's arm mid-pass. The officials initially rule it a fumble, with Atlanta returning the lose ball across midfield, then reverse the call to an incomplete pass, with replay revealing Darnold's arm was moving forward. Will Reichard follows up with a 39-yard field goal, and Minnesota now leads it 10-7 before halftime. The Falcons' first drive: The Falcons' drives since: There's the Kirk of recent weeks. Set up nicely after a long Bijan Robinson run, the former Vikings signal-caller floats one deep to Drake London, only for the ball to drop right into the hands of Josh Metellus, who snags his first pick since Week 2 against the San Francisco 49ers. The velocity wasn't there. Atlanta's defense started strong, but it breaks badly on a deep shot from Sam Darnold, with Jordan Addison finding space downfield and hauling in a 49-yard heave for a score. Nice adjustment by the wideout, but that's also just poor coverage on the Falcons' end, particularly from former Vikings cornerback Mike Hughes. It's now a 7-7 ballgame in Minneapolis. Brian Flores' front finally heats up, with Dallas Turner and Blake Cashman getting in Kirk Cousins' face to force a fourth-and-5. Atlanta goes for it past midfield, and Cousins can't connect with an open Ray-Ray McCloud, who can't haul in a catchable ball with Shaq Griffin on his tail. Eddie Goldman and Arnold Ebiketie with a sack apiece on the Falcons' first defensive series, by the way, just straight-up beating their men up front to force an early Vikings punt. It's all Atlanta right now, with Kirk Cousins and Co. controlling the ball and clock thanks to their under-center and play-action approach. This is where Kirk Cousins thrives, and finally Atlanta appears to be centering its calls around the quarterback's preferences. He's off to a hot start, opening 5 of 6, averaging 12.5 yards per attempt. Darnell Mooney is the latest to snag a clean over-the-middle shot, even with pressure in Cousins' face. Kirk Cousins' return begins with a heavy dose of Bijan Robinson, who gets the call on a fourth-and-short deep in Vikings territory and moves the chains. Cousins looks just fine, completing a couple of darts over the middle, including to Drake London, and gets his new squad into the end zone. Tyler Allgeier seals the deal with a powerful run up the gut, and Brian Flores' typically stout run defense falls behind early. It's 7-0 Atlanta, despite Vikings Country giving Cousins a hearty round of boos as he took the field. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. MINNEAPOLIS (AP) Sam Darnold tossed aside his stoic demeanor for a moment after realizing he was on the videoboard, aggressively twirling a towel to further stoke the crowd's fire after the Minnesota Vikings had pulled away from Kirk Cousins and the Atlanta Falcons late in the game. “I just felt the buzz. That was pure passion, pure joy, man,” Darnold said. Darnold added yet another highlight to his brilliant first season with the Vikings, passing for 347 yards and five touchdowns, both career highs, in a 42-21 victory over the foundering Falcons on Sunday to stretch their winning streak to six games. “It just felt like it was one of those days to keep the gas pedal down,” said coach Kevin O'Connell, who enjoyed his team's first 40-point game in three seasons on the job. Darnold passed for 250 yards after halftime to help the Vikings (11-2) break a 21-all tie early in the fourth quarter and stay one game behind NFC North-leading Detroit with a final-week matchup looming with the Lions. Jordan Addison had eight catches for 133 yards and three scores and Justin Jefferson racked up seven receptions for 132 yards and two touchdowns after going the past six games without scoring. “This is something that we want to do and we can do every single week,” Jefferson said. Cousins, whose departure in free agency for Atlanta prompted Minnesota to sign Darnold as a bridge to currently injured rookie J.J. McCarthy, threw two more interceptions without a touchdown in this unhappy homecoming following a mixed six-year run with the Vikings. Booed as he took the field, Cousins and the Falcons (6-7) left with a fourth consecutive loss to tumble out of first place in the NFC South and fall one game behind Tampa Bay. “When you’re playing well you usually aren’t as good as people are telling you when they’re patting you on the back, and if you’re in a rut you’re usually not as bad as people kind of leaving you for dead,” Cousins said. “The reality’s usually somewhere in the middle. You just have to keep playing and see where the dust settles in January.” Cousins went 23 for 37 for 344 yards for the Falcons, who crossed midfield on all nine of their possessions and finished with 496 total yards. He overthrew Ray-Ray McCloud III on fourth down in the first quarter, and the Falcons settled for short field goals just before and right after halftime. Their fate was sealed when McCloud fumbled the kickoff at the 32 after the Vikings went 70 yards in six plays for the go-ahead touchdown pass to Addison, who scored again seven plays later. The Falcons handed the Vikings an earlier touchdown when Kentavious Street was called for defensive holding during a field-goal attempt late in the second quarter, giving Darnold a fresh set of downs before a 12-yard laser to Jefferson on a post route on third-and-6. “You just can’t have the self-inflicted wounds and expect to win football games like we had today,” coach Raheem Morris said. Bijan Robinson had 22 carries for 92 yards and a touchdown and Tyler Allgeier rushed nine times for 63 yards and a score for the Falcons against the NFL’s leading run defense. Cousins, who was picked off four times last week, hesitated as he wound up to throw on first down from the Minnesota 47 in a tie game early in the second quarter and then inexplicably fired a pass straight to Josh Metellus as he sat in a zone in front of Drake London. Cousins has a NFL -most 15 interceptions. Byron Murphy snagged an overthrow for the second one near the goal line with a 35-21 lead and 6:26 left. Darnold, who went 22 for 28 without a turnover-worthy play despite heavy first-half pressure, then directed a seven-play, 98-yard drive to seal it. “I think we grew up a lot today offensively,” O'Connell said. Addison and Jefferson became the first duo in Vikings history to each have 100-plus receiving yards and two-plus touchdown catches in the same game. Addison also became the first Vikings player with three receiving touchdowns in a game since Stefon Diggs caught three from Cousins in 2019. Murphy has six interceptions this season, the most for the Vikings since Jimmy Hitchcock had seven in 1998. Falcons: CB Mike Hughes (knee) was back in the lineup after missing two games. Minnesota's 2018 first-round draft pick returned an interception for a touchdown against Atlanta in his NFL debut here. Vikings: CB Stephon Gilmore (hamstring) and backup OLB Patrick Jones (knee) were out. TE Josh Oliver (wrist/ankle) returned from a two-game absence, and LS Andrew DePaola (hand) and PK Will Reichard (quadriceps) were back from four-game injured reserve stints. Both teams play next Monday night, Dec. 16: Atlanta visits Las Vegas, and Minnesota hosts Chicago. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) On a play that didn't particularly matter in the final seconds of the fourth quarter, Seattle's defense was swarming anyway, chasing Arizona's Kyler Murray across the field before the quarterback dejectedly slid to the ground for a sack as the clock hit zero. The Seahawks have proved they have a good team. Now they want to be great. Their 30-18 victory over the Cardinals on Sunday suggests they're at least trending toward that goal. Seattle (8-5) has won four straight games and maintained its one-game lead in the NFC West. “We didn't want them to score,” linebacker Ernest Jones IV said of the final play. “We want to be dominant. And you can't just be dominant at certain times, you have to be dominant throughout the game.” After a slow start, the Seahawks controlled the final 3 1/2 quarters. Zach Charbonnet ran for a career-high 134 yards and two touchdowns, Geno Smith threw for 233 yards and a score, and the defense had two crucial interceptions in the first quarter. The Seahawks swept the season series from the Cardinals. They have won seven in a row against their division rival. Seattle shook off an early deficit to take a 24-10 lead by halftime. Charbonnet broke a tackle at midfield and sprinted 51 yards for a touchdown with 2:36 left in the second quarter. The 23-year-old Charbonnet thrived in an increased role, taking over for injured starter Kenneth Walker III. The second-year player also caught seven passes for 59 yards. “It's tough to tackle that guy in the open field,” Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said. “He's got speed and power.” Smith completed 24 of 30 passes and wasn't sacked. “Dude, I thought the (offensive line) was phenomenal,” Smith said. “The way they played, we can win every game we play.” The Cardinals (6-7) could have moved into a share of first place with a win. Instead, they have lost three straight and are fading from the playoff picture. Murray threw for 259 yards and two touchdowns, but also threw interceptions on back-to-back passes in the first quarter. It's the first time in Murray's six-year career that he's had at least two interceptions in consecutive games. “Today, you throw two picks, put yourself behind the eight-ball in the NFL, it's tough,” Murray said. “It's on me. Just put it on me.” The Cardinals cut the margin to 27-18 late in the third quarter on Murray's 2-yard, underhand shovel pass to James Conner. Murray also ran for the 2-point conversion. Arizona had a chance to make it a one-possession game midway through the fourth, but Chad Ryland's 40-yard field goal attempt bounced off the left upright. It was Ryland's third straight game with a missed field goal. “I've got to find some answers to get us going a little bit, because we haven't played great the past couple weeks,” second-year Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon said. “That falls on me. I've got to go back to the drawing board tomorrow, get these things corrected, put them in better position, and we've got to win a game.” The Seahawks took a 10-7 lead in the first quarter on back-to-back big plays by the defense and then the offense. Jones picked off Murray, giving Seattle the ball at the Cardinals 19. “It was kind of right to me, so I don't know what he saw,” Jones said. “But it happens.” Smith capitalized on the next play, finding Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a 19-yard touchdown. Murray was picked off again on the next possession, this time by Coby Bryant. The Seahawks took advantage of the good field position again, with Charbonnet running for a 1-yard touchdown and a 17-7 lead. It was a stunning turn of events for the Cardinals, who were in control on the first few drives. They cruised downfield on their opening possession and Murray hit Michael Wilson on a perfectly executed play-action pass for a 41-yard touchdown and a 7-0 lead. Seahawks: Walker (ankle, calf) was ruled out on Saturday. He's run for 542 yards and seven TDs this season and was one of seven inactive Seattle players. Cardinals: Starting S Jalen Thompson (illness) played after appearing on injury report Saturday. ... P Blake Gillikin (ankle) got hurt in the first half and Ryland had to take over as the punter. ... DL Roy Lopez (ankle) left the game in the second half. Seahawks: Host Green Bay next Sunday. Cardinals: Host New England next Sunday. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — The Arizona Cardinals picked a bad time to go through their worst stretch of the season. Kyler Murray threw two interceptions that led directly to first-half touchdowns and the Cardinals suffered a critical 30-18 loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. “Disappointing loss — didn't play our best ball there,” Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon said. “I've got to find some answers because we haven't played great the past few weeks.” Arizona has undergone a huge shift in less than a month. The Cardinals (6-7) were atop the NFC West in mid-November, thanks to a four-game winning streak. A three-game skid since its bye week may have put Arizona in an insurmountable hole. Dominant on both sides of the ball, the Seahawks (8-5) won their fourth straight to maintain a one-game division lead over the Los Angeles Rams, 44-42 winners over the Buffalo Bills. The Cardinals' stumble in what felt like a must-win game dropped them two games behind Seattle — which also has the tiebreaker — with four games remaining. “It's tough, obviously, when you lost to a divisional opponent, but we've still got four games left, still got a lot of ball left,” Cardinals linebacker Mack Wilson said. Arizona got off to a great start against its nemesis, scoring on the opening drive when Murray found Michael Wilson on a 41-yard touchdown pass. Murray and the Cardinals spent the rest of the afternoon playing like they were stuck in the desert sand to lose their seventh straight in the series. Seattle bottled up the usually elusive Murray, holding him to 16 yards rushing on three carries and preventing him from extending plays with his legs. Murray finished with 259 yards and two touchdowns on 25-of-38 passing with two interceptions. The two picks came at critical moments — just like last week. The first came with Arizona leading 7-3 in the first quarter. Trying to hit Marvin Harrison Jr., he didn't see Seattle linebacker Ernest Jones IV, who intercepted the pass and returned it to Arizona's 19. Geno Smith hit Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a touchdown on the next play. Murray then threw another interception on his next pass. Coby Bryant's pick set up Seattle at Arizona's 46 and Zach Charbonnet scored five plays later on a 1-yard run to put the Seahawks up 17-7. Murray also threw two key interceptions in last week's 23-22 loss to Minnesota. “I feel like I let the team down today — self-explanatory,” Murray said. “I can't do that.” It wasn't just Murray. After Charbonnet broke off a 51-yard touchdown run, Arizona converted a fourth-and-1 from its own 29 late the first half, only to have it negated by a holding call against left tackle Paris Johnson Jr. The Cardinals punted and trailed 24-10 at halftime. Arizona finally got its offense going again late in the third quarter, trimming Seattle's lead to 27-18 with a 2-yard shovel pass from Murray to James Conner and a 2-point conversion. The Cardinals later had a chance to pull within six after driving to the Seattle 21, but Chad Ryland missed a 40-yard field goal. The Cardinals' defense also had its share of miscues, allowing Seattle to run for a season-high 174 yards — 134 by Charbonnet — and finish with 409 total yards. “Ultimately, all three phases couldn't pull it together,” Gannon said. And now the Cardinals are running out of time. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

Prior to the 2012–2013 season, the basketball team represented the school in the Big 12 Conference. They are located in Columbia, Missouri, playing home games at Mizzou Arena (15,061). The team last played in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2023. The Tigers' season in 2022–23 was their first under head coach Dennis Gates, who was hired away from Cleveland State to replace the fired Cuonzo Martin.[2] The Missouri men's basketball program was a charter member of the Big 12 Conference, formed from the Big Eight Conference in 1996.[3] Entering the 2023–24 season the Tigers had an all-time record of 1,691–1,245 and a winning percentage of .576.

                "title": "List of college bowl games - Wikipedia",
                "content": "This is a list of college football bowl games, including those proposed and defunct. Six bowl games are part of the College Football Playoff, a selection system that creates bowl matchups involving twelve of the top-ranked teams in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). There are also a number of other college football postseason invitationals, as well as several all-star games. For nearly a century, bowl games were the purview of only the very best teams, but a steady proliferation of new bowl games required more teams, with 70 participating teams by the 2010–11 bowl season, then 80 participating teams by the 2015–16 bowl season. As a result, the NCAA has steadily relaxed the criteria for bowl eligibility. Teams with a non-winning record (6–6) were allowed starting in 2010. Requirements were further reduced to allow teams with outright losing records (5–7) to be invited since 2012, with the team with the best Academic Progress Rate score (among teams with 5–7 records) to be chosen first.[1] While inviting teams without winning records to bowl games has become more commonplace, there were several losing teams who played in bowl games before the last decade's changes in bowl eligibility: 1946 Gator Bowl, South Carolina (2–3–3); 1963 Sun Bowl, SMU (4–6); 1970 Tangerine Bowl, William & Mary (5–6); and the 2001 New Orleans Bowl, North Texas (5–6).[2] For the 2016–17 bowl season, 25% of the bowl participants (20 teams) did not have a winning record. The tables (College Football Playoff games, Other current Division I FBS bowl games) reflect changes for the 2022–23 bowl season. Bowl games are not limited to the Bowl Subdivision; teams in the three lower divisions of the NCAA—the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), Division II, and Division III—are also allowed to participate in bowl games. The playoff structure in those three divisions discourages most high-caliber teams from participating in bowl games, as teams would rather contest for their division's national championship than play in a bowl game. The same basic guidelines for bowl eligibility apply for those contests. As of 2017, one bowl game (the Celebration Bowl) exists for FCS, four bowls serve Division II, and ten exist for teams in Division III (not including the Stagg Bowl, which is the name for the NCAA Division III Football Championship game). Community college bowl games, not sanctioned by the NCAA, are also listed. Six major bowl games, known as the New Year's Six, rotate the hosting of the two semifinal games which determine the teams that play in the final College Football Playoff National Championship game.[3] The New Year's Six includes six of the ten oldest bowl games (missing the Sun, Gator, Citrus and Liberty bowls), continuing their original history of pitting the very best teams in the country against each other. These six games focus on the top 12 teams in the rankings, with only five teams ranked lower than 12th (all five were still ranked in the top 20) having ever played in the New Year's Six since the College Football Playoff system was inaugurated. ^ The Rose Bowl did not add a sponsor to its name until the 1998 season. Unlike other bowls, which give the sponsor's name precedence ahead of the bowl's name (effectively changing the title of the game), the Rose Bowl adds the sponsor as \"presented by\", after the words Rose Bowl. * Two-time move, due to World War II travel restrictions after the attack on Pearl Harbor moving the 1942 game to Duke Stadium in Durham, NC, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic moving the 2021 game to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, TX. † One-time move, due to damage to the Superdome from Hurricane Katrina, moving the 2006 game to the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, GA. Besides the six bowl games that are part of the College Football Playoff, there are a number of other postseason invitationals. Generally, two conferences will agree to send teams of a particular standing to a game beforehand. For instance, the Rose Bowl traditionally features the Big Ten and Pac-12 conference champions. Generally, the payout to the participating teams in a bowl game is closely correlated to its prestige. By comparison, each of the former BCS bowls (including the national championship game) had a payout of $18 million. NOTE: These games are similar to the National Invitation Tournament in Division I college basketball, for teams in conferences that did not make the NCAA Division II tournament. Additionally, NCAA Division III is home to the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl (1973–2019; was played in Salem, Virginia). NCAA awarded the 2020 and 2021 games to Canton, OH; the 2022 game to Navy-Marine Corp Stadium; the 2023 to Salem, VA; the 2024 game to Humble, TX; and the 2025 game back to Canton. In contrast to other bowl games, the Stagg Bowl operates within the NCAA tournament structure rather than as a stand-alone post-season game; it serves as the Division III national championship game to conclude a 32-team post-season playoff. The NAIA's national championship game (which is the conclusion of a 16 team playoff) is currently not named as a bowl, but has held a bowl name in the past. Additionally, from 1970 to 1996, NAIA football was split into two divisions and held a separate tournaments and championships for both divisions; the Division II championship was never named a bowl and as such the past names listed below do not apply to the Division II championship game. Football teams that are a part of the NCCAA may also be members of the NCAA, NAIA, or of neither. Bids to the Victory Bowl are given to NCCAA teams that did not make the NCAA or NAIA playoffs and is treated as the NCCAA Championship Game, but follows no playoff itself. The number of bowl games have risen steadily, reaching 41 (including the national championship game) by the 2015 bowl season. To fill the 80 available bowl slots, a record 15 teams with non-winning seasons participated in bowl games—including three with a record of 5–7. This situation led directly to the NCAA Division I Council imposing a three-year moratorium on new bowl games in April 2016.[13] Since 2010, organizers and boosters have continued to propose other bowl games—some of these proposals have since been dropped, while others are active proposals that have been placed on hold during the NCAA moratorium. Two proposed games, the Cure Bowl and Christmas Bowl, were turned down by the NCAA for 2010.[19] The Cure Bowl was eventually added in 2014, for the 2015 bowl season. In August 2013, the Detroit Lions announced that it would hold a new bowl game at Ford Field beginning in 2014, holding Big Ten and Atlantic Coast Conference tie-ins, despite the existence of the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl.[20][21] While Pizza Bowl organizers attempted to move the game to Comerica Park (a baseball stadium across the street from Ford Field), these plans never came to fruition.[22][23] In August 2014, the Lions announced that the new game would be known as the Quick Lane Bowl, and play its inaugural game on December 26, 2014. In a statement to Crain's Detroit Business, Motor City Bowl co-founder Ken Hoffman confirmed that there would be no Little Caesars Pizza Bowl for 2014.[22][24] In June 2013, ESPN.com reported that the so-called \"Group of Five\" conferences—the American Athletic Conference, Conference USA, MAC, Mountain West Conference, and Sun Belt Conference—were considering adding one or more new bowl games once the NCAA's current moratorium on new bowls expires after the 2013 season. This move was driven by a trend for the \"Power Five\" conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, and SEC) to play one another in bowl games. The 2013 season, the last of the current four-year bowl cycle, will have 16 bowls that involve two teams from \"Power Five\" leagues. The 2014 season, the first of a new six-year bowl cycle, will have at least 19, and possibly more, matchups of \"Power Five\" teams. The \"Group of Five\" was apparently concerned that this trend would mean that its teams might not have available bowl slots.[17] According to reports, the 2010 Christmas Bowl proposal would have involved a Mountain West team against an opponent from either the Pac-12 or The American. As for The American, it has suggested a new bowl game, most likely at Marlins Park in Miami. Two other venues of \"Group of Five\" schools in Florida—Spectrum Stadium (UCF, Orlando) and FAU Stadium (Florida Atlantic, Boca Raton)—are being considered for other potential bowls. A possible bowl in Little Rock would pit C-USA and the Sun Belt. Finally, the director of the current Little Caesars Bowl indicated that he had been in contact with officials from all of the \"Group of Five\" about starting new bowl games in Ireland (most likely Dublin), Dubai, and either Toronto or Nassau.[17] Recently, though, reports have indicated the proposed games in Ireland and Dubai would be unworkable.[25] The first new bowl to be confirmed for 2014 was the Camellia Bowl, a game created by ESPN and played in Montgomery, Alabama. It secured tie-ins with the MAC and Sun Belt, and an initial contract to run through the 2019 season. ESPN was also reported to be in negotiations to take over ownership of the existing Heart of Dallas Bowl and establish a new bowl game in Boca Raton.[26] Another ownership group interested in starting a Montgomery-based bowl at New ASU Stadium reportedly switched focus to Charleston, South Carolina. In the face of obstacles related to an NCAA ban on playing postseason games at predetermined locations in South Carolina due to the Confederate battle flag being flown at a civil war monument on the State House grounds, the ownership group instead chose to stage the Medal of Honor Bowl all-star game at Johnson Hagood Stadium beginning in 2014.[27] However, with the Confederate flag's removal from the State House grounds on July 10, 2015, the NCAA lifted its ban that day.[28] As such, on August 27 of that year, the Medal of Honor Bowl announced their plans to become a traditional postseason bowl game beginning on December 18, 2016, pending NCAA approval. The all-star game format was not played that year as a result.[29] However, in April 2016, the NCAA announced a moratorium on new bowl games;[13] organizers had subsequently announced plans to hold the bowl (as an all-star game again) in January 2018;[30] however, no further editions of the Medal of Honor Bowl have been played. * Bowl is a College Football Playoff semifinal, once every three seasons, in rotation under current CFP format All-star games predominantly featuring players from the FBS-level (or historical equivalents, such as Division I-A).[31] Source: NJCAA[36] [40] [40]",

                "content": "This is an accepted version of this page In North America, a bowl game, or simply bowl, is one of a number of postseason college football games primarily played by NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) teams. For most of its history, the FBS did not use a playoff tournament to determine an annual national champion, instead relying on a vote by sportswriters or coaches. In place of such a playoff, cities developed regional festivals featuring bowls. Prior to 2002, bowl game statistics were not included in players' career totals. Despite the move to establish a permanent system to determine the FBS national champion on the field (the Bowl Coalition, 1992-1994; the Bowl Alliance 1995-1997; the Bowl Championship Series, 1998-2013; and the College Football Playoff, 2014-present), some bowls are still held. Historically, the four \"major\" bowl games, originally played on New Year's Day, were:[1][2][3][4] Bowls originally featured the very best teams in college football, with strict bowl eligibility requirements for teams to receive invitations to participate. The number grew from 10 team-competitive (as compared to all-star) bowls in 1971 to 43 in 2023. Now the NCAA allows teams with 6–6 records and, since the 2001 season, sometimes even losing 5–6 and 5–7 seasons to participate to fill the slots. More than a quarter of 2023 bowl teams did not have winning records. The term \"bowl\" originated from the Rose Bowl stadium, site of the first postseason college football games. The Rose Bowl Stadium, in turn, takes its name and bowl-shaped design from the Yale Bowl, the prototype of many football stadiums in the United States. The term has since become almost synonymous with any major American football event, generally college football, with some significant exceptions. Two examples are the Egg Bowl, the annual game between the Mississippi State Bulldogs and the Ole Miss Rebels, and the Iron Bowl, the annual game between the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Auburn Tigers. In professional football, the National Football League (NFL) holds the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl. The term has crossed over into professional and collegiate Canadian football. A notable example is the annual Banjo Bowl between the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League (CFL). In Canadian university football, which has determined its national champions on the field for several decades, the \"bowl games\" are the two semi-final games that determine the participants in the Vanier Cup national championship game; since 2002 these have been the Uteck Bowl and the Mitchell Bowl. The matchups are determined on a conference rotation basis, with the Uteck Bowl being played at the easternmost host team, while the Mitchell is at the westernmost host team. The term also inspired many North American soccer championship matches to be titled the 'Soccer Bowl', including the United States men's college soccer championship from 1950 to 1952, the North American Soccer League championship from 1975 to 1984, and the North American Soccer League (II) championship from 2013 to 2017. The history of the bowl game began with the 1902 Tournament East-West football game, sponsored by the Tournament of Roses Association between Michigan and Stanford, a game which Michigan won 49–0. The Tournament of Roses eventually sponsored an annual contest starting with the 1916 Tournament East-West Football Game. With the 1923 Rose Bowl it began to be played at the newly completed Rose Bowl stadium, and thus the contest itself became known as the Rose Bowl Game. The name \"bowl\" to describe the games thus comes from the Rose Bowl stadium.[citation needed] Other cities saw the promotional value for tourism that the Tournament of Roses parade and Rose Bowl carried and began to develop their own regional festivals which included college football games. The label \"bowl\" was attached to the festival name, even though the games were not always played in bowl-shaped stadiums. The historic timing of bowl games, around the new year, is the result of two factors—warm climate and ease of travel. The original bowls began in warm climates such as Southern California, Louisiana, Florida, and Texas as a way to promote the area for tourism and business. Since commercial air travel was either non-existent or very limited, the games were scheduled well after the end of the regular season to allow fans to travel to the game site.[5] While modern travel is more convenient, all but 5 of 41 bowl games (as of 2017[update]) are still located in cities below approximately 36° N. Currently, college football bowl games are played from mid-December to early January. As the number of bowl games has increased, the number of games a team would need to win to be invited to a bowl game has decreased. With a 12-game schedule, a number of teams with only 5 wins have been invited to a bowl game. As of 2018[update], the University of Alabama has played in more bowl games than any other school, with 69 appearances (counting College Football Playoff semifinals and finals). Alabama also holds the record for most bowl victories with 41. Florida State held the record of consecutive bowl berths at 36 bowl appearances from 1982 to 2017. However, it is not recognized by the NCAA since the NCAA vacated FSU's 2006 Emerald Bowl victory over UCLA due to an academic issue.[6] The Rose Bowl was the only major college bowl game in 1930. By 1940, there were five major college bowl games: the Rose Bowl, the Sugar Bowl (established in 1935), the Cotton Bowl Classic (1937), the Orange Bowl (1935), and the Sun Bowl (1935). By 1950, the number had increased to eight games. This slate of eight bowl games persisted through 1960, but by 1970 the number had increased again, to 11 games. The number continued to increase, to 15 games in 1980, to 19 games in 1990, 25 games in 2000, 35 games in 2010, and 41 games by 2015 (40 games plus two teams playing a second game to determine the National Champion). Up until around the 1950s, the small number of games were played solely on New Year's Day, with the only major exception being if the holiday occurred on a Sunday. The tradition of not playing bowl games on Sunday initially started from the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl not being held on Sundays for fear of spooking horses tied at churches, but in later years was done to avoid conflict with NFL games. For the 2016–17 bowl season, the 41 games require a little over three weeks, starting December 17 and ending on January 9. While bowl games were originally exclusive to warm cities thought of as winter vacation destinations, indoor stadiums allow games to be played in colder climates. The attendance of 106,869 for the 1973 Rose Bowl set the Rose Bowl Stadium record, and an NCAA bowl game attendance record.[7][8] The Rose Bowl stadium still is the largest capacity stadium and the Rose Bowl game has the highest attendance for postseason bowl games. In the 1990s, many bowl games began to modify or abandon their traditional names in favor of selling naming rights. While some include the traditional name in some form (e.g. the Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual), others have eliminated their traditional name in favor of solely using their corporate sponsor's name (e.g. the former Citrus Bowl became the Capital One Bowl for some time after the financial services company Capital One bought the naming rights; it later reverted to its original name in 2015). Prior to 1992, most bowls had strict agreements with certain conferences. For example, the Rose Bowl traditionally invited the champions of the Pac-10 and the Big Ten conferences. The Sugar Bowl invited the SEC champion and the Orange Bowl hosted the Big 8 conference champion. These conference tie-ins led to situations where the top-ranked teams in the country could not play each other in a bowl game. The national championship was decided after the bowls, solely by voters for various media polls, who tried to decide which team was best, sometimes based on wins against far inferior teams. As a result, there could be multiple championship titles and no single champion. This led to the term \"Mythical National Championship\", which is still used to describe high school national champions, since high school sports have state championship tournaments but not national. Because of the vested economic interests entrenched in the various bowl games, the longer regular season compared to lower divisions of college football, and a desire not to have college players play several rounds of playoff games during final exams and winter recess, the Division I Bowl Subdivision long avoided instituting a playoff tournament to determine an annual national champion. Instead, the National Champion in the Football Bowl Subdivision has traditionally been determined by a vote of sports writers and other non-players. In 1995, the Bowl Alliance, formed by the major bowls and conferences, put in place a system where the two highest ranked teams would play each other, even if they were each affiliated with a different bowl. However, the Pac-10 and Big Ten and the Rose Bowl did not participate. Number 1 vs Number 2 bowl match-ups became far more likely, but were not guaranteed. After the 1997 season, undefeated Michigan was ranked first in both major polls, but as the Big Ten champion, they played eighth-ranked Pac-10 champion Washington State in the Rose Bowl. The top Bowl Alliance team, #2 and unbeaten Nebraska, faced one-loss, third-ranked Tennessee in the Orange Bowl. Michigan won by five on New Year's Day and the next night, Nebraska beat Tennessee (playing with an injury-hobbled Peyton Manning) by 25. The AP kept Michigan as the champion, but the Coaches' Poll jumped Nebraska, playing its final game for retiring coach Tom Osborne, in part because of their more lopsided victory against a more highly ranked opponent. The following season, the Rose Bowl, Pac-10, and Big Ten joined the other bowls and major conferences to form the Bowl Championship Series. The BCS attempted to match the two highest ranked teams in the country based upon calculations from various sources, including statistics and coaches' polls, with one of the four bowl games in the consortium, the Rose Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Orange Bowl, rotating the role of \"national championship.\" In 2006, a dedicated BCS Championship Game rotated among the BCS venues. The BCS Championship Game, while separate from the four main bowls, was still rotated among their sites. The Coaches Poll was contractually obligated to recognize the winner of the game as its national champion. However, other polls such as the AP Poll may deviate and pick a different team, particularly in years when multiple teams were equally worthy of reaching the game. In 2003, for instance, one-loss LSU won the BCS National Championship over Oklahoma, but the AP crowned one-loss USC champion after its Rose Bowl win. For the 2014–15 season, the BCS was replaced by a new consortium, the College Football Playoff (CFP). The new system uses a four-team single-elimination tournament, with its participants selected and seeded by a committee; the semi-final games are rotated between pairs of the six member bowls yearly, the Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl, then Orange Bowl and Cotton Bowl Classic, and then the Fiesta Bowl and Peach Bowl. The winners from the two semi-final bowls advance to the College Football Playoff National Championship, which is played at a neutral site determined using bids. Members of the New Year's Six that are not hosting semi-final games revert to their traditional tie-ins. Like its predecessors, and in contrast to the officially sanctioned NCAA tournaments at lower levels, the College Football Playoff is not officially recognized as an NCAA championship. The National Football League also used the name \"bowl\" for some of its playoff games. While the NFL Championship was not named a Bowl initially, the league instituted the Pro Bowl as the name of its all-star game in 1951, and introduced the Bert Bell Benefit Bowl (also known as the Playoff Bowl) as a matchup of the two second-place teams in each division from 1960 to 1969. When the professional football AFL–NFL merger occurred in 1970, the AFL–NFL World Championship Game became the NFL's championship and is now known as the Super Bowl, as it has been named since 1968 (the name was coined by Lamar Hunt after watching his daughter play with a super ball). There has also been the American Bowl, a preseason match held overseas, and various one-time games informally nicknamed bowls, such as the Bounty Bowl, Ice Bowl, Snow Bowl, Freezer Bowl, Fog Bowl, Mud Bowl, Tuna Bowl,[9] Manning Bowl,[10] Harbaugh Bowl, Kelce Bowl and the proposed (but ultimately canceled) China Bowl. As a result, other professional football leagues used or use the name Bowl for their championships, such as the World Football League (World Bowl), NFL Europe (World Bowl), Arena Football League (ArenaBowl), Indoor Football League (United Bowl), Great Lakes Indoor Football League (Great Lakes Bowl) and American Indoor Football Association (AIFA Championship Bowl). The Canadian Football League nicknames one of their rivalries as the Banjo Bowl and another QEW Bowl (also known as the Battle of Ontario); like most Canadian sports leagues, however, the CFL's championship is instead known as a cup (in the CFL's case, the Grey Cup). At the NCAA top level of football, the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS, previously known as Division I-A from 1978 through 2005), teams must earn the right to be bowl eligible, generally by winning at least six games and by not having a losing record at the end of their regular season schedule. They can then be invited to a bowl game based on their finishing placement in their conference, and tie-ins that their conference has to various bowl games. Alternately, a bowl-eligible team may receive an at-large invitation to a bowl game, independent of conference tie-ins. Bowls are popular among coaching staffs because the NCAA allows college teams going to bowl games extra weeks of practice they would otherwise not have, and bowl games pay the teams for their participation. Teams belonging to a conference split the money with their conference mates. For the 2010 season, 70 of the 120 Division I FBS teams played in a bowl game. An association of the bowl games themselves, independent of the NCAA, has existed since at least 1989.[11] Originally known as the Football Bowl Association, the organization announced a rebranding as \"Bowl Season\" in October 2020.[12] It aims to work \"with all existing bowls to promote the benefits of the entire bowl system\".[12] NCAA bowl season generally lasts from mid-December to early January with the first week of bowl games usually featuring teams from the Group of Five conferences (American Athletic Conference, Conference-USA, Mid-American Conference, Mountain West Conference, Sun Belt Conference and FBS Independents with the exception of Notre Dame) with bowl games featuring mainly teams from the Power Four conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC and FBS Independent Notre Dame) coming in the second week. At lower levels, teams play in playoff tournaments with a national championship game at a neutral site, making invitational bowl games less popular than in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). The Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) features only one bowl game, the Celebration Bowl, formerly the Heritage Bowl. It invites the top teams from historically black colleges and universities, one from the SWAC and one from the MEAC. The SWAC has historically had a longer regular season that extends past Thanksgiving weekend, preventing its teams from participating in the FCS tournament and more closely mirroring the FBS. At the Division II level there are currently four postseason bowls for teams that did not qualify for the DII playoffs: the Live United Texarkana Bowl, Heritage Bowl, America's Crossroads Bowl, and Florida Beach Bowl. All four of the Division II bowls are played on the first weekend of December. At the NCAA Division III level, all bowls that are currently played are recent developments (starting in 2008 or later). For the 2017 season, 10 bowls were scheduled to be played by teams that did not qualify for the DIII playoffs: a six-bowl series organized for ECAC teams, a two-bowl series organized between the Centennial Conference and MAC, the New York State Bowl (between Liberty League and Empire 8), and the New England Bowl (between the ECFC, MSCAC, CCC and NEWMAC). Prior to 2008, the ECAC also held the ECAC Bowl (1989–2003) for Division I-AA and the North Atlantic Bowl (2007), the last of which is now integrated into the conference's six-bowl series. Additionally, the Division III championship game has historically been known as the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl. Outside the NCAA, the Victory Bowl is sponsored by the NCCAA, a group that does not restrict its membership to either NCAA or NAIA. The NAIA does not have any invitational postseason bowl games. Starting with the now defunct Wheat Bowl, the NAIA found it easier to schedule bowl games early in the season rather than late—this allowed the schedule to accommodate large college bowl games and high school sports; one such extant example is the College Fanz First Down Classic, a pre-season bowl game for NAIA teams. In Canadian football, the Mitchell Bowl and Uteck Bowl are held as the semi-final games for Canada's university football national championship. The bowl winners go on to play each other for the Vanier Cup. The Mitchell Bowl is always hosted by either the Canada West or Ontario conference champion, while the Uteck Bowl is always hosted by either the Atlantic Canada or Quebec conference champion. Following team-competitive bowl games, a series of all-star bowl games round out the postseason schedule. These games seek to showcase the best departing college players. Such college all-star games include the East–West Shrine Bowl, the Senior Bowl, and the Hula Bowl. Other all-star games, now defunct, include the North–South Shrine Game, and NFLPA Collegiate Bowl. There have also been pre-season and regular-season games carrying the \"bowl\" moniker, including the Mirage Bowl, the Glasnost Bowl and the Canadian Football League's Banjo Bowl. Examples of bowl games that are not part of the postseason include the Iron Bowl and the Egg Bowl. Recently, the term \"bowl\" has been added to other games that have some special note or sub-plot to the actual game, in college or the National Football League. An example of this is the Bowden Bowl given to games where Florida State and Clemson were coached by the father-son duo of Bobby Bowden and Tommy Bowden, respectively. Games between two very poor teams and/or of a very poor standard of play have been jokingly referred to as the \"Toilet Bowl\".[13] The championship game of the Superliga Nacional de Futebol Americano is known as the Brasil Bowl. In the European Football League (EFL), a European Cup style tournament for European American Football teams affiliated with IFAF Europe, the final game of the EFL is called the Eurobowl, and has been held annually since 1986. In Denmark, the national championship game is called Mermaid Bowl, named after the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale. In Finland, the national championship game is called Vaahteramalja (\"Maple Bowl\") and was first held in 1980. In Germany, the national championship game in American football is called the German Bowl and was first held in 1979. Apart from the German Bowl, a Junior Bowl has also been contested in Germany since 1982 and a Ladies Bowl was introduced in 1990. Other, related, national championship games in Germany include the German Flag Bowl (est. 2000), German Junior Flag Bowl (1999) and a German Indoor Flag Bowl (2000).[14] The annual championship game of the British American Football Association National Leagues is known as the Britbowl. The championship game of the American Football Ireland Premier Division is called the Shamrock Bowl. It is generally held around July or August each year and has been played every year since 1986 except for 2000 & 2020. The winner of the Israeli Football League is determined every year in the Israel Bowl. The first to lift the Becker Trophy was the Jerusalem Lions in 2008. The championship game between the East Japan and West Japan champions in college football, is known as the Koshien Bowl. The top middle school teams also compete in the Koshien Bowl. While the pro football championship is known as the Japan X Bowl. The winners of the Koshien and Japan X bowls play each other for the Japan National Championship in the Rice Bowl. The annual high school football championship game is the Christmas Bowl. The championship game of the Dutch AFBN First Division is called the Tulip Bowl. The first edition was held in 1986. The championship game of the Swiss Nationalliga A is called the Swiss Bowl. It was first held in 1986.",

                "title": "3 takeaways from Oregon’s win over Penn State in the Big Ten Championship game - SBNation.com",
                "content": "Filed under: Oregon finished its season undefeated and championships of their new conference in the first year. The No. 1 Oregon Ducks defeated the No. 3 Penn State Nittany Lions 45-37 to win the Big Ten Championship in their first year in the conference, pulling off the nail-biting finish. It was a high-scoring affair from the beginning, as the Ducks scored touchdowns on their first three drives of the game, getting out to a quick double-digit lead. But, from there, it was a back-and-forth affair, going down to the final minutes until Penn State quarterback Drew Allar threw a game-clinching interception with 1:54 remaining as the Nittany Lions attempted a game-tying comeback drive. Here are three quick takeaways from the Ducks 45-37 win over Penn State. From the initial outlook, the Ducks looked to run the football, working both star running back Jordan James and backup Noah Whittington. While they had one of the most explosive passing attacks in the country entering the game, the Ducks looked to be the more physically imposing team, finishing the night with 188 rushing yards on 40 carries, not including sacks or kneel-downs. James got going early and really carried the momentum towards the second half, finishing with 87 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 20 carries, while Whittington got a season-high 15 touches of his own in the win. Oregon got going early as they pushed the football on the ground and stalled near the end of the second half when they went away from the run. But, they remained balanced in the second half, generating enough offense to keep a healthy lead from the Nittany Lions en route to the 45-37 victory. Now, Penn State was no slouch on the ground either — as they needed an explosive rushing attack to put up 37 points, given their inconsistencies through the air. The Nittany Lions finished with a whopping 298 yards on 8.8 yards per carry, not including sacks, as both Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton eclipsed 100 yards in the loss. When Penn State came back to cut the lead to one-score at the end of the first half, it was in big part due to their running game as they rotated their two star backs. Then, when they were looking to make the improbable comeback late in the game, they once again looked to their running backs to lead the charge and it almost resulted in a victory. Nonetheless, it was a classic Big Ten game with a ton of activity on the ground, which was a defining factor throughout the night in a competitive battle. While there were only eight flags thrown on the night, there were a few that had significant magnitude, especially early for the Nittany Lions. Penn State committed four 15-yard penalties within the first quarter and a half. Three of them came on the defensive side of the ball, and the Nittany Lions gave up touchdowns on all three drives, allowing Oregon to hop out to a quick 21-10 lead. Then, when trying to keep up with Oregon’s offense, Penn State had an unnecessary roughness penalty on offense that limited a scoring opportunity, keeping them at a distance for much of the first half. While the end of the game will be more closely evaluated, Oregon’s start was just as important, and the three penalties were big in moving the Ducks down the field and getting those early touchdown drives. On the other hand, Oregon committed just three penalties for 24 yards, remaining disciplined throughout the night, although there were moments where the officiating could be seen as questionable. You don’t win games when you have a negative turnover differential and the Nittany Lions had two crucial ones on Saturday in comparison to none for the Ducks. Drew Allar’s first interception came at a big moment, as the Nittany Lions had forced a punt and were trying to drive out of their own end zone. But, the quarterback threw a pass behind his intended receiver on a dig route and Oregon cornerback Dontae Manning intercepted the pass, taking the ball all the way back to the Penn State one-yard line. The Ducks subsequently scored on a Jordan James one-yard rushing touchdown, getting them a 28-10 lead, which was going to be tough for Penn State to climb out of, even if they cut the score to seven at halftime. Coming out of the half, Penn State had a big chance for a response, getting well into Oregon territory, but they elected to kick a field goal on 4th & 5 at the Oregon 23-yard line and Ryan Barker missed the 40-yarder. Oregon jumped out to a two-score lead from there and never trailed, maintaining a healthy lead until Penn State’s final drive, where the Nittany Lions got the ball at their own 37-yard line with two minutes to go down eight points. After a nine-yard run from Kaytron Allen, they elected to give Drew Allar a shot, throwing a one-on-one go-ball to wide receiver Harrison Wallace, who couldn’t get any separation on the outside against defensive back Nikko Reed. Reed stayed in lockstep and made an incredible play on the ball, turning his head and securing the interception to seal the deal for Oregon, bringing them their first Big Ten Championship. The Ducks will maintain the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff with the win and improve to 13-0 on the year with the victory, while Penn State could drop, but is still expected to get a home game to begin the new 12-team CFP format. Nonetheless, Saturday night’s game was a thriller at Lucas Oil Stadium, setting the stage for what should be an exciting College Football Playoff coming soon. The College Football Playoff selection committee will announce the 12-team field on Sunday, December 8 at 12 p.m. ET. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops. Something went wrong.

With a 45-37 victory over No. 3 Penn State on Saturday night, the top-ranked Ducks remained unbeaten while clinching a first-round bye, and likely the No. 1 seed, in the upcoming College Football Playoff. LIVE: Latest updates on final College Football Playoff bracket reveal The tale of Oregon's success against the Nittany Lions in Saturday's matchup is all about head coach Dan Lanning's speedy offense. Sixth-year quarterback Dillon Gabriel, recently named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, tossed four touchdown passes, while wide receiver Tez Johnson exploded for 181 receiving yards, a Big Ten Championship record. Penn State hung around for most of the contest, coming back from a 28-10 deficit in the second quarter of the shootout to eventually make it a one-score game in the final frame. However, the Nittany Lions' last-minute hopes of tying the matchup were erased with a Drew Allar interception on a deep pass with time ticking away. Saturday marked the first matchup between Oregon and Penn State since 1995, and it didn't disappoint. In the end though, the explosiveness of the Ducks' offense proved to be too much for the Nittany Lions to answer over a 60-minute period, despite getting three touchdown passes from Allar and 292 total rushing yards. Now, attention turns toward the official CFP bracket, which will be announced on Sunday. Oregon will likely be locked into the No. 1 seed, while Penn State's official fate will lie in the hands of the committee. However, the Nittany Lions do appear likely to be one of the four squads to host a first-round matchup, especially after Saturday's one-score loss to the country's top-ranked team.

                "title": "Oregon holds off Penn State to win Big Ten in debut season, locking up No. 1 seed in College Football Playoff - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Oregon's first season in the Big Ten was perfect. The top-ranked Ducks held on for a 45-37 win in a back-and-forth shootout against No. 3 Penn State to win the Big Ten championship and move to 13-0 while securing the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff. Penn State out-gained Oregon 518-466, but two costly turnovers proved to be enough for Oregon to hold on for the win. Drew Allar threw two interceptions — one led to a touchdown for the Ducks in the first half, and the other was thrown with less than two minutes remaining in regulation. Both teams were perfect in the red zone, scoring on all nine combined possessions. Tez Johnson caught 11 passes for 181 yards and a touchdown for the Ducks. Nick Singleton and Kaytron Allen both eclipsed 100 yards rushing for the Nittany Lions, who finished with 292 rushing on the ground. Allar was 20 of 39 passing for 226 yards and three touchdowns, but the two interceptions proved costly. He also ran for 54 yards and a score on five carries. Next up for Oregon is the CFP quarterfinals on Dec. 30 or Dec. 31. Penn State will likely host a first-round game. CBS Sports was here throughout the night with updates, analysis and highlights. Read on below for takeaways from the game. Eight days ago, Penn State was destined to be no better than the No. 5 seed in the College Football Playoff. Then Ohio State lost to Michigan, sending Penn State to the Big Ten Championship Game to play for a title and No. 1 seed in the field. Should Penn State's seeding improve for playing — and losing — in the Big Ten Championship Game? After all, Notre Dame sat at home as an independent and Texas lost to a lower-ranked Georgia team in the first overtime game in SEC Championship Game history. Penn State should fall no further than No. 7 in the field, which could set up a 7-10 matchup with Big Ten foe Indiana, but the Big Ten is sure to push the committee to keep Penn State as the No. 5 seed above Notre Dame and Texas. The difference between a No. 5 seed and No. 7 seed is huge. The Nittany Lions could host Clemson, the ACC champion, as the fifth seed, or they could host Indiana as the seventh seed. The biggest difference is the potential quarterfinal matchup, with the No. 7 seed potentially playing No. 2 Georgia and the No. 5 seed likely playing Boise State or Arizona State. Who would you rather play? Selection Sunday will be interesting for the Nittany Lions. Oregon didn't just shake up the Big Ten in its first season as a new member, it claimed it as its own. The Ducks head into the College Football Playoff with an unblemished 13-0 record, the best mark in school history, and knocked off the conference's three blue bloods — Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State — to lock off the No. 1 seed in the upcoming playoff. Conference realignment afforded us five potential first-timers claiming conference championships this weekend, and while Army and Arizona State followed hrough as newbies, the biggest move was made by the Ducks. Oregon carried the Pac-12's banner, and all of the criticism as being too soft as a West Coast team, and delivered the rough-and-rugged Big Ten a dose of their own hard-nosed attack. The Ducks went punch for punch with heavyweight Ohio State and knocked out the Buckeyes. They drilled Michigan. And on Saturday night they outlasted Penn State, which they led by double digits for most of the night. While fans celebrate conference titles and playoff berths, pour one out for the Pac-12. The Conference of Champions produced two title winners this season in the Big 12 (Arizona State) and Big Ten (Oregon). Turns out the Pac-12 wasn't all that bad. Penn State is not built to play catch-up on the football field. When the Nittany Lions were forced to do so against Oregon, they got frustratingly close to breaking through and taking control, but fell short time and time again as the Ducks' wingspan proved to be just long enough to hold on for a 45-37 win in the Big Ten Championship Game. Oregon built an 18-point lead, but Penn State pulled within a score three times. Oregon countered the Nittany Lions with another score or turnover every time. Penn State out-gained Oregon 518-466, but two interceptions by Drew Allar were too much to overcome. Allar's first interception in his own red zone was returned to the 1-yard line and resulted in an Oregon touchdown. The second one was a 50-50 ball down the right sideline with less than two minutes remaining, allowing Oregon to sit on the ball to melt the clock and secure the win. Penn State had an incredible 16 explosive plays for 341 yards on runs of 10-plus yards and passes of 15-plus yards. Again, it wasn't enough in the second-highest scoring Big Ten title game in history. Welp, Drew Allar did everything he could to pull Penn State back in the game, but he buried the Nittany Lions with two costly mistakes. His second interception with 1:54 remaining may have just sealed Oregon's 45-37 win. Allar went deep down the right sideline on a 50-50 ball, but he was off target and Oregon's Nikko Reed was there for the over-the-shoulder interception at the Ducks' 16-yard line. Penn State got the three-and-out It needed but a great punt return was called back after officials ruled the Nittany Lions called a fair catch. Even so, the Nittany Lions have solid field position just inside their own 40-yard line with less than three minutes remaining. Oregon leads 45-37 with two minutes remaining. Get ready for a dramatic finish. What a play by Drew Allar to pull Penn State within a touchdown — again. The Nittany Lions quarterback threw a beautiful side-arm pass between two defenders in the end zone, with Oregon defender Matayo Uiagalelei ripping at his undershirt as he contorted his body just enough to fire the pass. There's 3:41 remaining in the game. Allar is 20 of 38 passing for 226 yards and three touchdowns with one interception, which has been the difference in the game. That interception, which was returned to the 1-yard line, led to an Oregon touchdown in the first half. Penn State needs a stop. Oregon and Penn State have combined for 29 explosive plays (15 by Penn State) midway through the fourth quarter in an unexpected shootout in Indianapolis. Explosive plays are defined by runs of 10-plus yards and passes of 15-plus yards. Those 29 plays have accounted for an incredible 629 combined yards. Oregon leads Penn State 45-30 with 6:55 remaining. Oregon kept its offense on the field for fourth-and-2, and Dillon Gabriel delivered a beautiful dart down the middle to tight end Terrance Ferguson to keep a crucial drive alive that may have led to the game-deciding touchdown with 7:31 remaining. Ferguson caught a 20-yard pass to pick up a first down at Penn State's 22-yard line to keep the drive alive. Jordan James capped it with a three-yard touchdown run up the middle. The Ducks have managed to respond time and time again when Penn State pulls within striking distance. This certainly seems to be the final body blow. Gabriel is 22 of 31 passing for 283 yards and four touchdowns. Tez Johnson has 11 catches for 181 yards, including a 16-yarder on third-and-9 earlier in the possession. Back and forth we go. Penn State is within a touchdown again thanks to its powerful and explosive rushing attack led by Kaytron Allen, and some misdirection and creative scheming by offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki. Backup quarterback Beau Pribula came into the game and rushed around the left side for an 18-yard gain to the 1-yard line to set up Allen for a touchdown run with 14:17 remaining in regulation. Penn State's Philly Special didn't result in a 2-point conversion, so the Nittany Lions are down eight instead of six. Allen has pushed his total to 124 yards on 14 carries. Penn State's six-play, 97-yard drive with 82 yards coming on the ground and 15 via a big personal foul penalty on the Ducks with the Nittany Lions back up to their own 3-yard line. Penn State can't be stopped on the ground, and the Nittany Lions are in business heading into the fourth quarter. Kaytron Allen has busted off runs of 32 and 26 yards on the latest drive to place the Nittany Lions on Oregon's 19-yard line heading into the fourth quarter. This is quite the performance for Allen, who is up to 123 yards rushing after picking up only 64 combined yards in the previous three games. Penn State is up to 235 yards rushing and is averaging 8.4 yards per carry. If Penn State can convert and score a touchdown on this possession, there's hope yet for the Nittany Lions to win this game by sticking to the ground game rather than counting on Drew Allar to deliver through the air. Penn State forced a much-needed punt to get the ball back with a 14-point deficit with 1:40 remaining in the third quarter. Penn State is out-rushing Oregon 172-144, and Drew Allar has been impressive with 180 yards and two touchdowns, but the margin for error is small and the Nittany Lions need to put together a touchdown drive. Penn State running back Kaytron Allen has returned to the game after a brief visit to the injury tent. Allen was apparently injured on the Nittany Lions' first possession of the second half. He returned for the final third-down play on Penn State's second drive, which ended with a punt to Oregon with the Ducks ahead 38-24 with 6:14 remaining in the third quarter. Allen has 60 yards on nine carries. Tez Johnson is super slippery, and the Ducks are paddling quickly across the water again after Penn State pulled within a score. The star receiver has been unstoppable most of the night, sliding out of tackles and shifting his hips and maintaining his high-end speed to propel Oregon's offense. His latest catch and run resulted in a 48-yard touchdown and pushed the Ducks ahead by two touchdowns with 7:26 remaining. That was quite the response by Oregon, which had sputtered offensively after grabbing a 28-10 lead. Penn State had an opportunity to tie the game, or pull within four, but its long opening possession ended with a missed field goal. Johnson is up to 153 yards and a touchdown on seven catches (eight targets). The Ducks' scoring drive was its quickest yet: 77 yards on only five plays. An impressive opening drive for Penn State results in zero points as Ryan Barker misses a 40-yard field goal. That's gotta be disappointing for the Nittany Lions, who have been seemingly doing everything right since falling behind 28-10. Penn State drove 57 yards on 11 plays to open the second half, with Drew Allar continuing to show some tremendous poise in the pocket and touch on the ball. Running back Kaytron Allen headed to the injury tent after that drive as well. We'll keep our eyes on the Penn State star's status. We expected a defensive slugfest, with the victor perhaps finding a way to hit 30 points. Instead, we've gotten a showcase for the offenses with a record-setting first half at the Big Ten Championship. Oregon and Penn State combined for 537 yards, and the Nittany Lions led the way with 283 yards but enter halftime trailing 31-24 thanks, in part, to an interception that was returned 24 yards to the 1-yard line to set up a short touchdown for the Ducks. The 55 combined points are the most ever in the first half of a Big Ten Championship. Penn State superstar Nick Singleton has rushed for 86 yards to lead all runners; Oregon's Jordan James has 53 yards and a touchdown on 15 carries. Dillon Gabriel is 11 of 18 passing for 153 yards and three touchdowns, but he struggled after a hot start, as five of his last eight pass attempts fell incomplete. Penn State forced Oregon to punt on back-to-back possessions and Drew Allar led the Nittany Lions to a pair of touchdowns on consecutive possessions to climb out of an 18-point hole. Dillon Gabriel hit Tez Johnson for a 25-yard gain, Jordan James picked up a first down and Gabriel scrambled 11 yards to put the Ducks in field-goal position with 40 seconds remaining. The offense stalled, however, and Atticus Sappington booted a 32-yard field goal to stretch the lead back to a touchdown. Penn State's defense has settled down after falling behind 28-10. Penn State has plenty of fight. The Nittany Lions have stormed back from an 18-point deficit with a pair of touchdowns to cut make this a one-score game with 1:53 remaining in the first half. You wanted points? Did you expect points? Well, you're getting 'em. The teams have combined for 52 points in the first half, matching the betting total for the game in Las Vegas. We've already tied the record for most points in the first half of a Big Ten Championship (2012). Drew Allar hit on a pair of throws on the last scoring drive, but it was his legs that did the most damage with an 8-yard gain and a 7-yard touchdown run up the gut. Allar hasn't been stellar but he's battling. After nearly throwing a Pick 6, which Oregon turned into a touchdown anyway on a 1-yard touchdown run, he has responded with back-to-back touchdown drives. The Penn State defense has also forced back-to-back three-and-outs. The Nittany Lions have the momentum, just when it seemed the Ducks had tugged it away. Penn State receiver Omari Evans ran wide open to the back of the end zone for a 22-yard pass from Drew Allar to cut the lead to 28-17. Penn State needed that in a big way after falling behind 18 points on an interception by Allar on the previous possession. Kaytron Allen broke through for a 24-yard run and Nick Singleton added a 17-yard gain to highlight the drive. Penn State has 224 yards of offense compared to Oregon' 193 yards, but the difference is the aforementioned interception and Oregon's offense maintaining long possessions. Dontae Manning picked off a pass by undercutting a route with two receivers crossing from right to left across the middle of the field, and returned it 24 yards to Penn State's 1-yard line. Jordan James ran over the left side to cap the gigantic pendulum swing with a 1-yard touchdown. Just moments after the Nittany Lions had forced the Ducks to punt for the first time tonight, the Ducks' defense responded to help push the lead out to three touchdowns early in the second quarter. Wow. Penn State's defense successfully forced a punt after allowing touchdowns on Oregon's first three possessions. The Nittany Lions desperately needed that in a game that was inching closely to getting out of hand early. Zion Tracy called for a fair catch at the 11-yard line after the 55-yard punt by Ross James. Oregon has outgained Penn State 192-153. Penn State has had success but just needs to sustain drives. Another possession, another touchdown for Oregon. The Ducks are perfect tonight, scoring on their first three possessions. Tez Johnson was the star of the drive with two big catches, slipping out of a couple of would-be tacklers, to help push the tempo with chunk plays. He's already up to four catches for 79 yards. He caught passes of 24 and 31 yards on the drive. Gabriel capped it with a quick four-yard strike to Terrance Ferguson on a quick flick of the wrist. Oregon is quickly creeping up on 200 yards of offense (189 yards) against one of the nation's best defenses. It's a big night for passing plays out of the backfield. Nick Singleton snuck out of the backfield, got a fantastic matchup against an Oregon linebacker and slipped wide open in the middle of the field for a 22-yard touchdown pass from Drew Allar. The drive included a couple of fantastic catches by tight end Tyler Warren, who is up to 48 yards through two possessions. The seven-play, 75-yard drive is a great response with Oregon in position to take control of the game. Oregon has come to play smash mouth football in the trenches. Jordan James is picking up tough yards between the tackles, Noah Whittington is speeding on the outside and Dillon Gabriel is hitting short throws as they dissect the Nittany Lions' top-5 defense. It's a thing of beauty, balance and brute force. Kenyon Sadiq scored his second touchdown as he bled out of the backfield for a wide-open, two-yard pass on a fake pitch to the left by Dillon Gabriel. The drive was kept alive thanks to a costly facemark penalty on Tony Rojas on a fourth-and-1 run attempt by Jordan James, who may have been short of the first-down marker. The Ducks are downright balanced on offense, rushing for 66 yards and passing for 63 on their first two possessions. Penn State capitalized on an explosive 41-yard run from Nick Singleton and kicked a 33-yard field goal on its first possession to cut into Oregon's lead. Drew Allar connected on 3 of 5 passes, but was flushed out of the pocket in the red zone and was unable to capitalize on great field position set up by the rushing attack. Wheel routes always win. Kenyon Sadiq snuck out of the backfield, made an easy catch and hurdled a tackler to score on a 28-yard pass from Dillon Gabriel to cap the Ducks' opening possession with a touchdown. Oregon marched 84 yards on nine plays. Jordan James ran for 20 yards on four carries and Gabriel completed all three passes for 48 yards. Oregon was also helped by a facemark penalty that pushed the Ducks 15 yards closer to the end zone. Not a great start for Penn State's defense. Let's see what offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki has up his sleeve. Oregon offensive guard Marcus Harper II Is warming up and will be available tonight. He has missed the last three games. Harper has started two games at left guard while also playing right guard In seven games this season. Do-everything tight end Tyler Warren can break the single-season record for receiving yards by a tight end today with just five more receiving yards. He's caught 81 passes for 978 yards and six touchdowns this season. He's already set the Big TEn's single-season record for receptions by a tight end (81). Incredibly, Warren is the only player in the FBS with 900 receiving yards and more than 100 yards rushing. Dan Lanning and James Franklin have won a bunch of games, but both are trying to break through with a long-awaited championship tonight. Dan Lanning's career is off to a blistering start with a 34-5 leading the Ducks but he has yet to win a conference title. He can become just the fifth FBS coach in the last 50 years with 35 wins in his first three seasons with a victory today. Franklin has led Penn State to multiple 10-win seasons, but hasn't won the Big Ten title since 2016 and is set to enter the CFP for the first time in his career. His Nittany Lions would have been in the CFP in six of the last seven years if it was a 12-team field instead of a four-team format. What's holding Penn State back? Franklin is 1-13 against top 5 teams leading the Nittany Lions and enters today on an 11-game losing streak against those opponents. He's also 0-11 against top 5 teams when Penn State is also ranked, the most losses by any head coach without a win in FBS history. Meanwhile, Oregon is trying to win at the Big Ten title in its first season in the conference. A win would allow Lanning to surpass Chip Kelly with the most wins in a coach's first three seasons leading the Ducks. The Ducks' 34-5 record over the last three seasons is the second-best mark in the FBS. I've seen plenty of surprise from fans and media alike that Oregon is only a 3.5-point favorite in the game, but the spread makes sense to me. There's far too much attention paid to Penn State's inability to beat Ohio State and it overshadows the fact the Nittany Lions are a genuinely good team! But if I'm taking a side in this game, I'm going with the Ducks. While both teams are evenly-matched across the board, there's one spot that Oregon has a big advantage: at receiver. Penn State's entire passing attack is built through Tyler Warren, and he's awesome, but what if Oregon takes him away? What's the counter? Oregon has plenty of options, and it should be enough to make the difference.
