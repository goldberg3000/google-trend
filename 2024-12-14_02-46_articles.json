                "content": "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her biographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of widespread public interest. Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005 starting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). Her singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Love Story\", and \"You Belong with Me\" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She experimented with rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop album 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\" and \"Look What You Made Me Do\". Shifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020), explored indie folk styles in the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, and subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024). She began re-recording her Big Machine albums as Taylor's Version[a] since 2021, due to an ownership dispute with the label. Through the 2020s, she garnered the US number one songs \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"All Too Well\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"Cruel Summer\", \"Is It Over Now?\", and \"Fortnight\". Her sixth concert tour, the Eras Tour (2023–2024), and its accompanying concert film are respectively the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time. Swift is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with over 200 million units sold and a record seven albums that moved one million copies first-week. She is the highest-grossing touring act, the first billionaire with music as primary income, and the world's richest female musician. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard and Forbes, as well as the only individual from the arts to have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 30 MTV Video Music Awards, and 50 Billboard Music Awards, having won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year and the IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year at least four times each. She is an advocate of artists' rights and women's empowerment. Her fans are known as Swifties. Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor.[2][3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[4] Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[5] Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer,[6] whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music that shaped her career.[4] Swift is of Scottish, English, and German descent, with distant Italian and Irish ancestry.[7][8][9] Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania that her father had purchased from one of his clients,[10] and she spent her summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop.[11] She is a Christian[12] and attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[13][14] When her family moved to Wyomissing, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[15][16] As a child, she performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions[17] and traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[18] Her early love for country music was influenced by Shania Twain, Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[14] and she spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[19][20] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she became determined to pursue a country-music career in Nashville, Tennessee.[21] At 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[22] She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting.[23] She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of Ronnie Cremer, a computer repairman and local musician who also assisted Swift with writing an original song.[24] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD.[25] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, 13-year-old Swift was given an artist development deal and began to travel regularly to Nashville with her mother.[26][27] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[28][29] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[30] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[3][31] In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[32][33] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[34] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[35] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing,[36] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people's stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[27][20] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[37] At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[39] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[27] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[40][41][42] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[20] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[43] Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[44][45] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a platinum-certified debut album.[46] Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations.[47] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[48] as a replacement for Eric Church.[49] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[47][28] Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\", and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. \"Our Song\" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a Hot Country Songs number-one single,[50] and \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts.[51][52][53] Swift released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[54][55] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[56] Brad Paisley,[57] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[58] Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[59] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[60] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[61] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[62] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[63] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[64] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[65] Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released in November 2008 in North America,[66] and in March 2009 in other markets.[67] On the Billboard 200, Fearless spent 11 weeks at number one, becoming Swift's first chart topper and the longest-running number-one female country album.[68] It was the bestselling album of 2009 in the US.[69] Its lead single, \"Love Story\", was her first number one in Australia and the first country song to top Billboard's Pop Songs chart,[70][71] and its third single, \"You Belong with Me\", was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart.[72] Three other singles were released in 2008–2010: \"White Horse\", \"Fifteen\", and \"Fearless\". All five singles were Hot Country Songs top 10 entries, with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" topping the chart.[73] In 2009, Swift toured as an opening act for Keith Urban and embarked on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour.[74] \"You Belong with Me\" won Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[75] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by the rapper Kanye West, an incident that became the subject of controversy and widespread media coverage.[76] That year, Swift won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[77] Billboard named her the 2009 Artist of the Year.[78] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for \"Love Story\" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called \"Thug Story\".[79] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.[80] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[81] Throughout 2009, Swift featured on and wrote other musicians' releases. She featured on \"Half of My Heart\" by John Mayer, whom she was romantically linked with in late 2009.[82][83] She wrote \"Best Days of Your Life\" for Kellie Pickler,[84] co-wrote and featured on Boys Like Girls' \"Two Is Better Than One,[85] and wrote two songs—\"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\"—for the soundtrack of Hannah Montana: The Movie, in which she had a cameo appearance.[86][87] She wrote and recorded \"Today Was a Fairytale\" for the soundtrack of Valentine's Day (2010), in which she had her acting debut.[88] \"Today Was a Fairytale\" was her first number-one single on the Canadian Hot 100.[89] While shooting Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[90] On television, she made her debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode[91] and hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host ever to write their own opening monologue.[92][93] Swift's third studio album, Speak Now, was released in October 2010.[94] Written solely by Swift,[95] the album debuted the Billboard 200 with over one million US copies sold first week[96] and became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist.[97] Speak Now was supported by six singles: \"Mine\", \"Back to December\", \"Mean\", \"The Story of Us\", \"Sparks Fly\", and \"Ours\". \"Mine\" peaked at number three and was the highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100,[98] the first three singles reached the top 10 in Canada,[89] and the last two reached number one on Hot Country Songs.[73] Swift promoted Speak Now with the Speak Now World Tour from February 2011 to March 2012[99] and the live album Speak Now World Tour – Live.[100] At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Swift performed \"Mean\", which won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance.[101] She was named Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[102][103] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[104] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[105] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[106] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[107] Rolling Stone named Speak Now on its list of \"50 Best Female Albums of All Time\" (2012).[108] Red, Swift's fourth studio album, was released in October 2012.[109] On Red, Swift worked with Chapman and new producers including Max Martin, Shellback, Dan Wilson, Jeff Bhasker, Dann Huff, and Butch Walker, resulting in a genre-spanning record that incorporated eclectic styles of pop and rock such as Britrock, dubstep, and dance-pop.[110][111] The album opened at number one on the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million sales[112] and was Swift's first number-one album in the UK.[113] Its lead single, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", was her first number one on the Billboard Hot 100,[114] and its third single, \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", reached the top five on charts worldwide.[115] Other singles from Red were \"Begin Again\", \"22\", \"Everything Has Changed\", \"The Last Time\", and \"Red\".[116] Red and its single \"Begin Again\" received three nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (2014).[117] Swift received American Music Awards for Best Female Country Artist in 2012, Artist of the Year in 2013,[118][119] and the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist Award for the fifth and sixth consecutive years.[120] At the 2014 Country Music Association Awards, Swift was honored with the Pinnacle Award, making her the second recipient in history after Garth Brooks.[121] The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and became the highest-grossing country tour upon completion.[122] Swift continued writing songs for films and featuring on other artists' releases. On the soundtrack album to The Hunger Games (2012), Swift wrote and recorded \"Eyes Open\" and \"Safe & Sound\"; the latter of which was co-written with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett. \"Safe & Sound\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[123] She wrote and produced \"Sweeter than Fiction\" with Jack Antonoff for the soundtrack to One Chance (2013).[124] Swift featured on B.o.B's \"Both of Us\" (2012)[125] and provided vocals for Tim McGraw's \"Highway Don't Care\" (2013), also featuring Keith Urban.[126] She was a voice actress in The Lorax (2012),[127] made a cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[128] and had a supporting role in the dystopian film The Giver (2014).[129] From 2010 to 2013, Swift was romantically involved with the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, the political heir Conor Kennedy, and the singer Harry Styles.[83] In March 2014, Swift began living in New York City, which she credited as a creative influence on her fifth studio album, 1989.[note 1] She described 1989 as her first \"official pop album\" and produced it with Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[132] Released in October 2014, the album opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.28 million copies sold.[133] Its singles \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\" reached number one in Australia, Canada, and the US, with the first two making Swift the first woman to replace herself at the Hot 100 top spot.[134] Other singles include \"Style\", \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Out of the Woods\", and \"New Romantics\".[135] The 1989 World Tour (2015) was the highest-grossing tour of the year with $250 million in total revenue.[136] After publishing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal stressing the importance of albums as a creative medium for artists,[137] in November 2014, Swift removed her catalog from ad-supported, free music streaming platforms such as Spotify.[138] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during its free three-month trial period and threatened to withdraw her music from the platform,[139] which prompted Apple Inc. to announce that it would pay artists during the free trial period.[140] Swift then agreed to keep 1989 and her catalog on Apple Music.[141] Big Machine Records returned Swift's catalog to Spotify among other free streaming platforms in June 2017.[142] Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[143] At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence.[144] On her 25th birthday in 2014, the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live opened an exhibit in her honor in Los Angeles that ran until October 4, 2015.[145][146] In 2015, Swift won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist.[147] \"Bad Blood\" won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.[148] At the 58th Grammy Awards (2016), 1989 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, making Swift the first woman to win Album of the Year twice.[149] Swift dated the DJ Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016.[150] They co-wrote the song \"This Is What You Came For\", featuring vocals from Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg.[151] She recorded \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" with Zayn Malik for the soundtrack to Fifty Shades Darker (2017)[152] and won a Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year with \"Better Man\", which she wrote for the band Little Big Town.[153] In April 2016, Kanye West released the single \"Famous\", in which he references Swift in the line, \"I made that bitch famous.\" Swift criticized West and said she never consented to the lyric, but West claimed that he had received her approval and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the song amicably over the phone. The controversy made Swift a subject of an online \"cancel\" movement.[154] In late 2016, after briefly dating Tom Hiddleston, Swift began a six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn and retreated herself from the public spotlight.[155][156] In August 2017, Swift successfully countersued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment. Four years earlier, she informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event.[157] The public controversies influenced Swift's sixth studio album, Reputation, which explored the impact of her fame and musically incorporated electropop with urban styles of hip hop and R&B.[158] Released in November 2017,[159] Reputation opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million US sales[160] and topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada.[161] The album's lead single, \"Look What You Made Me Do\", was Swift's first UK number-one single[162] and topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the US.[163] Its singles \"...Ready for It?\", \"End Game\", and \"Delicate\" were released to pop radio.[164] Reputation was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.[165] Swift featured on the country duo Sugarland's \"Babe\" (2018).[166] At the 2018 American Music Awards, Swift won four awards, which made her accumulate 23 trophies in total and become the AMAs' most awarded female musician, surpassing Whitney Houston.[167] The same year, she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour,[168] which became the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history and grossed $345.7 million worldwide.[169] In November 2018, Swift signed a new deal with Universal Music Group, which promoted her subsequent albums under Republic Records' imprint.[170] The contract included a provision for Swift to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[171][172] Swift's first album with Republic Records, Lover, was released in August 2019.[173] She produced the album with Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[174] Lover peaked atop the charts of such territories as Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the US.[175] The album spawned five singles: \"Me!\", \"You Need to Calm Down\", \"Lover\", \"The Man\", and \"Cruel Summer\"; the first two singles peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and the lattermost single became a resurgent success in 2023, reaching number one.[176] Lover was 2019's best selling album in the US and best selling album by a solo artist worldwide.[177] The album and its singles earned three nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[178] At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Video of the Year for \"You Need to Calm Down\", becoming the first female and second artist overall to win the category for a self-directed video.[179] While promoting Lover in 2019, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with the talent manager Scooter Braun after he purchased Big Machine Records, including the masters of her albums that the label had released.[180] Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would only allow her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign.[180] In November 2020, Swift began re-recording her back catalog, which enabled her to own the new masters and the licensing of her songs for commercial use, substituting for the Big Machine-owned masters.[181] In February 2020, Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group after her 16-year contract with Sony/ATV expired.[182] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift surprise-released two \"sister albums\" that she recorded and produced with Antonoff and Aaron Dessner: Folklore in July and Evermore in December.[183] Joe Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced a few songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[184] Both albums incorporated a muted indie folk and alternative rock production;[185] each was supported by three singles catering to US pop, country, and triple A radio formats. The singles were \"Cardigan\", \"Betty\", and \"Exile\" from Folklore, and \"Willow\", \"No Body, No Crime\", and \"Coney Island\" from Evermore.[186] Folklore was the bestselling album of 2020 in the US[187] and, together with \"Cardigan\", made Swift the first artist to debut a US number-one album and a number-one song in the same week; she achieved the feat again with Evermore and \"Willow\".[188] According to Billboard, Swift was the highest-paid musician in the US and highest-paid solo musician worldwide of 2020.[189] Folklore made Swift the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times, winning the category at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021).[190] At the American Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Artist of the Year for a third record time (2020)[191] and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Pop/Rock Album (2021).[192] Swift played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song \"Beautiful Ghosts\".[193][194] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival.[195] Swift's re-recordings of her first six studio albums began with Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), which were released in April and November 2021. Both peaked atop the Billboard 200, and the former was the first re-recorded album to do so.[196] Fearless (Taylor's Version) was preceded by \"Love Story (Taylor's Version)\", which made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on Hot Country Songs.[197] Red (Taylor's Version) was supported by \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot 100.[198] Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released in October 2022.[199] The album incorporates a restrained electropop[200] and synth-pop sound[201] with elements of hip hop, R&B, and electronica.[199][202] In the US, Midnights was her fifth to open atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies, and its tracks, led by the single \"Anti-Hero\", made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 10 of the Hot 100.[203] Globally, the album broke the record for the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify and peaked atop the charts of at least 14 countries.[204] The album's two further singles, \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\", both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[205] According to Billboard, Swift was the top-earning solo artist in the US and the top-earning musician worldwide of 2021.[206][207] She won six American Music Awards including Artist of the Year in 2022.[208] At the MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won her third and fourth trophies for Video of the Year with All Too Well: The Short Film, her self-directed short film that accompanies \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", in 2022[209] and \"Anti-Hero\" in 2023.[210] During this period, Swift won three Grammy Awards: Best Music Video for All Too Well: The Short Film[211] and Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year for Midnights. Swift became the first artist to win Album of the Year four times in Grammy history.[212] Swift's next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), were released in July and October 2023. The former made Swift the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand,[213] and the latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, claiming her career's largest album sales week.[214] 1989 (Taylor's Version)'s single \"Is It Over Now?\" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[215] Swift featured on Big Red Machine's \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" (2021),[216] Haim's \"Gasoline\" (2021),[217] Ed Sheeran's \"The Joker and the Queen\" (2022),[218] and the National's \"The Alcott\" (2023).[219] For the soundtrack of Where the Crawdads Sing (2022), she wrote and recorded \"Carolina\", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards.[220] In 2023, Swift was the most streamed artist on Spotify,[221] Apple Music,[222] and Amazon Music;[223] and the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023).[224] She had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of 2023 in the US, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991.[225] Besides music, Swift had a supporting role in the period comedy film Amsterdam (2022)[226] and began writing an original script for her directorial feature film debut with Searchlight Pictures.[227] In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour's global cultural and economic impact,[228] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[203] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour's ticket sales.[229] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history.[230][231] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[232][233] Swift's eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, was released on April 19, 2024.[234] Topping charts globally, the album broke a string of records: it marked the first album ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week; sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US; made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top 10 of Australia's ARIA Singles Chart; and went on to spend 16 weeks atop the Billboard 200—Swift's longest-running number-one album on the chart. The lead single, \"Fortnight,\" featuring Post Malone, became Swift's 12th number one song on the Hot 100.[235][236][237] After the pandemic, Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity.[238] From 2023 onward, Swift found ubiquitous success, albeit more dominant than before, with the successes of the re-recordings, the Eras Tour, its concert film, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department, significantly increasing her net worth; Music Business Worldwide remarked this as a \"new stratosphere of global career success\" for Swift.[239][240] In 2023, she began dating the American football player Travis Kelce,[241] and in 2024, won Artist of the Year at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[242] The same year, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to Twitter and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[243] In July, Swift and Kelce received death threats from a stalker in Gelsenkirchen, Germany,[244] and three children were killed in a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed workshop in Southport, England, leading to civil unrest in the UK.[245] In August, all three of the Eras Tour concerts in Vienna were canceled following the arrest of two suspects for allegedly planning an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack in the city. The plan was uncovered by US Intelligence and was thwarted by Austrian police forces.[246] Swift's early musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[247] and Keith Urban's country crossover sounds incorporating rock, pop, and blues.[248] She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift to Red.[249] The albums feature country signifiers such as banjo, six-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, in addition to pop melodies and rock influences;[250][251] Speak Now draws on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock.[95][252] Critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's narrative songwriting rather than musical direction[253][254] and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots.[255][256] After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna.[257][258] 1989, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum machines.[259] Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums;[260] Reputation consists of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences;[158][261] and Lover features eclectic elements from country, pop-punk, and folk rock.[262] When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity,[263] but others regarded it as necessary for Swift's artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism.[264][265] Her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore explore alternative and indie styles of rock and folk, and both incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, synthesizers, and drum pads.[266][267] The latter experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures, and diverse instruments.[268][269] Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter.[267] Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both incorporate a minimalist, subdued synth-pop sound, making use of analog synthesizers, sustained bass notes, and simple drum machine patterns.[270][271] With continuous musical reinventions,[272] Swift was described by Time and the BBC as a musical \"chameleon\".[273][274] Jody Rosen commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[275] Clash wrote that she has the versatility to \"no longer [...] be defined by any genre or sound label\".[276] According to Ann Powers, Swift's sound is genre-agnostic, blending and \"reconfiguring\" elements of country, R&B, indie pop, and hip hop.[277][278] Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range[283] and a generally soft and breathy timbre that Rolling Stone deemed versatile.[284][285] Reviews of Swift's early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers.[286] Despite the criticism, most reviewers appreciated that Swift refrained from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune and how she prioritized \"intimacy over power and nuance\" to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience[287]—a style that has been described as conversational.[288][289] According to Powers, Swift's defining vocal feature was her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[290] On Red and 1989, Swift's vocals are electronically processed to accompany the pop production.[291][288] Her voice on Reputation and Midnights incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near-rap delivery which emphasizes rhythm and cadence over melody.[292][277] She uses her lower register vocals extensively in \"Cardigan\"[293] and both her lower and upper registers in Evermore; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as \"breathy and bright\" and the lower register as \"full and dark\".[269] Reviews in The New York Times, Variety and The Atlantic were more appreciative of Swift's vocals in her later albums.[251][294][295][296] She ranked 102nd on Rolling Stone's 2023 list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time: \"A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights officially settled the argument.\"[285] Laura Snapes of The Guardian said that Swift's \"vocal directness\" enables her to express wide-ranging feelings, highlighting some trademarks such as \"yo-yoing vocal yelp\" and \"climactic, processed cri de coeur\".[297] Amanda Petrusich praised how the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals accentuate her lyrics.[298] Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations.[299][300] She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them.[301] Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton;[19][104] 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette;[302] Joni Mitchell;[303] and Fall Out Boy.[304] She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.[28][305] Her literary influences include the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F. Scott Fitzgerald,[306] and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson;[307] the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift.[308] In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[28] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[309][310] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[311][312] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[95][313] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[314] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[257] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[315] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[316] Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[317][318] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[300][319] She often references or draws inspiration from historical events and figures.[320] Swift's confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[321][28][322] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music,[323][324][325] although some perceived her as a fragile, juvenile artist, a label she has consistently challenged.[321] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[326][327] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[158] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[327] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[28] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[328][329][330] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[331] On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[332] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[311] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[332] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[333] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[334] Swift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[335] Fans noticed that the fifth track of every Swift album was the most emotionally vulnerable of the album.[336] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[337] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[338] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[203] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\".[339] Critics have analyzed the distinctive qualities and thematic depth in Swift's songwriting. Critic Kitty Empire opined in 2024 that Swift is \"a profoundly old-fashioned artist\", whose songs \"tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously\" unlike most pop music of the time; Empire attributed it to Swift's country beginnings.[340] Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[341][334] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[342] Mojo dubbed her \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[343] Academics have variably described her as a poet laureate,[344] philosopher,[345] and bard.[346] Swift commands large audiences on stage,[347][348][349] captivating them through emotional storytelling and vocal delivery rather than relying on elaborate choreography.[350] According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[351] In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[352] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[353] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[354] Swift's concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[355] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[356] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[357] acoustic guitar; piano;[358] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[359][360] six-string banjo,[361] or ukulele.[362] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[298][363] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\".[364][358] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop's most approachable superstar\",[365] and the 21st century's most popular performer.[366] Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[367] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time, she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" in 2011[368] and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White the year before.[369] In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes.\"[370] From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement.[371] She worked with American Express for the \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed) and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[372] Swift produced the music video for \"Bad Blood\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[373] Her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media, starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[374] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles \"Me!\" with Dave Meyers, and \"You Need to Calm Down\" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and \"Lover\" with Drew Kirsch,[375] but first ventured into sole direction with the video for \"The Man\" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction).[376] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[203] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[377] Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.[367] Swift's discography is a \"critically hailed songbook\", as per Time's Sam Lansky.[378] She has won 14 Grammy Awards (including four for Album of the Year—the most won by an artist),[379] an Emmy Award,[380] 40 American Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[381] 50 Billboard Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[382] 118 Guinness World Records,[383] 30 MTV Video Music Awards (including five Video of the Year wins—the most by an act),[384] 12 Country Music Association Awards (including the Pinnacle Award),[385] eight Academy of Country Music Awards,[386] and two Brit Awards.[147] As a songwriter, she has been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association,[59][387] the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the National Music Publishers' Association and was the youngest person on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time in 2015.[388][389] At the 64th BMI Awards in 2016, Swift was the first woman to be honored with an award named after its recipient.[390] From available data, Swift has amassed over 50 million album sales and 150 million single sales as of 2019,[391][392][393] and 114 million units globally, including 78 billion streams as of 2021.[394][395] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ranked her as the Global Recording Artist of the Year for a record four times (2014, 2019, 2022, and 2023).[396] Swift has the most number-one albums in the UK and Ireland for a female artist this century,[397][398] earned the highest income for an artist on Chinese digital music platforms (CN¥ 159,000,000 as of 2021),[399] and is the first artist to occupy the entire top five[note 2] of the Australian albums chart[402][403] and the top ten of the country's singles chart.[404] Swift remains the world's highest-grossing touring act ever, with cumulative ticket sales at $3.12 billion as of December 2024, per Pollstar.[405] The Eras Tour is the highest-grossing tour of all time and the first to surpass $1 billion in revenue.[406][407] Beginning with Fearless, each of her studio albums have opened with over one million global units.[408][409] Swift is the most-streamed act on Spotify,[410] and the most-streamed female artist on Apple Music.[411] On Spotify, she is the only artist to have received more than 250 million and 350 million streams in one day (260 million on October 27, 2023, and 380 million on April 19, 2024)[412] and was the first female act to reach 100 million monthly listeners.[413][198] The most entries and the most simultaneous entries (175 and 34 songs), and most number-ones (5) for a soloist on the Billboard Global 200, are among her feats.[414][415] Swift is the first and only artist to occupy the top nine spots on the Global 200.[414] She has the most entries (154), top-ten songs (20), and number-ones (3)[note 3] among solo acts on the Global 200 Excl.

Time included her on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019.[435] She was one of the \"Silence Breakers\" that the magazine spotlighted as Person of the Year in 2017 for speaking up about sexual assault,[436] and she received the honor again in 2023 for her cultural domination that year.[378] Time described Swift as the first Person of the Year to be recognized for \"achievement in the arts\", as well as the first woman to be recognized and appear on a Person of the Year cover more than once.[437][378] In 2014, she was named to Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in the music category[438] and again in 2017 in its \"All-Star Alumni\" category.[439] Swift became the youngest woman to be included on Forbes' list of the 100 most powerful women in 2015, ranked at number 64.[440] In 2023, she was ranked by Forbes as the fifth-most powerful woman in the world, the first entertainer to place in the top five.[441] Swift received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from New York University and served as its commencement speaker on May 18, 2022.[203] In 2024, Billboard ranked her at number 2 on its \"Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century\" list.[442] Swift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture, and the economy.[443][444] She dominates cultural conversations,[445][446] leading some publications to describe her as a cultural \"vitality\" or zeitgeist.[447][448][449] Her music, life, and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture.[272] Initially a teen idol,[450] she has been referred to as a pop icon;[260][451] publications describe her enormous popularity and longevity as unwitnessed since the 20th century.[452][453] In 2013, New York magazine's Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the \"world's biggest pop star\" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift \"falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\", leaving her contemporaries \"vying for second place\".[275] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[454] Swift's fans are known as Swifties.[229] Billboard noted that only a few artists have achieved her level of chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[455] Swift's million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[456][457] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an \"economic genius\".[458] Although labeled by the media in her early career as \"America's Sweetheart\" for her girl next door persona,[459][460] Swift has been called by detractors \"calculated\" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[461][462] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and \"slut-shaming\",[463][464] as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[465] Swift has also been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[466][467] Swift's private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[468][469] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[470][471] In December 2023, Swift's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, alleging stalking and safety risks; media outlets have reported that the information posted by Sweeney is a synthesis of publicly available data.[472][473] In February 2024, it was reported that Swift had sold one of her two private jets.[474] \"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we're at this moment where there's no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that's on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact.\" Swift helped shape the modern country music scene,[476] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[275][476] pioneered the use of the internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[27][47] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[477][275] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[478] her guitar performances contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\": a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[479][480] According to Pitchfork, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[481] and Billboard notes her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[482] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[483] Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift.[484][485] She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album \"eras\".[486][487] Swift is a subject of academic study and scholarly media research.[272] Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts.[488][272] Swift has influenced numerous music artists, and her albums have inspired a generation of singer-songwriters.[477][266][489] Journalists praise her ability to reform industry practices, noting how her actions changed streaming policies, prompted awareness of intellectual property in new musicians,[490][491] and reshaped ticketing models.[492] Various sources deem Swift's music a paradigm representing the millennial generation;[493] Vox called her the \"millennial Bruce Springsteen\",[494] and The Times named her \"the Bob Dylan of our age\".[495] Swift earned the title Woman of the Decade (2010s) from Billboard,[496] Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards,[497] and Global Icon at the Brit Awards for her impact.[395] Senior artists such as Madonna,[498] Stevie Nicks,[499] Jon Bon Jovi,[500] Dolly Parton,[501] and Elton John have praised her musicianship.[502] Carole King regards Swift as her \"professional granddaughter\" and thanked Swift for \"carrying the torch forward\".[503] Springsteen called her a \"tremendous\" writer,[504] while Elvis Costello compared Swift's songwriting to that of Bob Dylan,[505] and Billy Joel considered Swift the Beatles' successor.[506] Britney Spears labeled Swift \"the most iconic pop woman of our generation\".[507] Media outlets describe Swift as a savvy businesswoman;[508][509] in 2024, she topped Billboard's annual Power 100 ranking of the top music industry executives.[510] Swift is known for her traditional album rollouts, consisting of a variety of promotional activities that Rolling Stone termed as an inescapable \"multimedia bonanza\".[511][512] Easter eggs and cryptic teasers became a common practice in contemporary pop music because of Swift.[513] Publications describe her discography as a music \"universe\" subject to analysis by fans, critics, and journalists.[514][515][516] Swift maintains an active presence on social media and a close relationship with fans, to which many journalists attribute her success.[517][444][518] Her

for the National Hockey League's Nashville Predators and Sony Cyber-shot digital cameras,[527][528] and became the global ambassador for New York City in 2014 and Record Store Day in 2022.[529][530] Swift identifies as a pro-choice feminist,[531] and is a founding signatory of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment.[532] Specifically, she criticized the US Supreme Court's decision to end federal abortion rights in 2022.[533] Swift also advocates for LGBT rights,[534] and has called for the passing of the Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.[535][536] She performed during WorldPride NYC 2019 at the Stonewall Inn, a gay rights monument, and has donated to the LGBT organizations Tennessee Equality Project and GLAAD.[537][538][539] A supporter of the March for Our Lives movement and gun control reform in the US,[540] Swift is a vocal critic of white supremacy, racism, and police brutality.[541][531]

election.[547] For the 2024 election, she endorsed Harris and Tim Walz.[548][549] Swift became a billionaire in October 2023, becoming the world's first musician to achieve the status \"solely based on her songs and performances\".[550][551] Forbes has estimated her net worth at $1.6 billion as of October 2024,[552] making her the richest female musician in the world.[553] Forbes had named her the annual top-earning female musician in 2016, 2019, 2021, and 2022.[554] She was the highest-paid celebrity of 2016 with $170 million—a feat recognized by Guinness World Records as the highest

In 2009, she donated $100,000 to the Red Cross to help the victims of the Iowa flood of 2008.[562] The same year, she performed at Sydney's Sound Relief concert, which raised money for those impacted by bushfires and flooding.[563] In 2011, Swift used a dress rehearsal of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the US, raising more than $750,000.[564] In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, she donated $500,000.[565] In 2009, Swift sang at BBC's Children in Need concert and raised £13,000 for the cause.[566] In 2016, she donated $1 million to Louisiana flood relief efforts and $100,000 to the Dolly Parton Fire Fund.[567][568] Swift donated to food banks after Hurricane Harvey struck Houston in 2017.[569] Swift donated $1 million for Tennessee tornado relief in 2020 and again in 2023,[570][571] as well as $5 million toward the reliefs efforts after Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton in 2024.[572] Swift has also donated to cancer research. As recipient of the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year in 2011, Swift donated $25,000 to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Tennessee.[573] In 2012, she participated in the Stand Up to Cancer telethon, performing the charity single \"Ronan\", which she wrote in memory of a four-year-old boy who died of neuroblastoma.[574] She has also donated $100,000 to the V Foundation for Cancer Research[575] and $50,000 to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.[576] She has made donations to her fans several times for their medical or academic expenses.[577] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift donated to the World Health Organization and Feeding America[578] and supported independent record stores.[579][580] Swift performed \"Soon You'll Get Better\" on the One World: Together At Home television special, a benefit concert curated by Lady Gaga for Global Citizen to raise funds for the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.[581] She is a supporter of the arts. A benefactor of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame,[582] Swift has donated $75,000 to Nashville's Hendersonville High School to help refurbish the school auditorium,[583] $4 million to build a new education center at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville,[584] $60,000 to the music departments of six US colleges,[585] and $100,000 to the Nashville Symphony.[586] She has also provided one-off donations. In 2007, she partnered with the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police to launch a campaign to protect children from online predators.[587] She has donated items to several charities for auction, including the UNICEF Tap Project and MusiCares.[588] Swift has also encouraged young people to volunteer in their local communities as part of Global Youth Service Day.[589] Also a promoter of children's literacy, she has donated money and books to schools around the country.[590][591] In 2018 and 2021, Swift donated to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network in honor of Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.[592] Swift donated to fellow singer-songwriter Kesha to help with her legal battles against Dr. Luke and to actress Mariska Hargitay's Joyful Heart Foundation.[592][593] During the Eras Tour, Swift donated to food banks at every stop;[594] she also directly employed local businesses throughout the tour and gave $197 million in bonus payments to her entire crew.[595][596][597] In February 2024, she donated $100,000 to the family of a woman who died in a shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl parade.[598][599] Studio albums Re-recorded albums Films Documentaries",

She is known for narrative songs about her personal life, as well as songs she wrote about other famous people, including Rebekah Harkness in the song “the last great american dynasty”. She has sold more than 52 million albums, including 37 million in the US. She is one of the world's best-selling music artists. She is the highest-earning female musician of the 2010s and 2020s.[source?] Taylor Swift has won 14 Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award, and 118 Guinness World Records. She is the most-awarded act and woman at the American Music Awards (29 wins) and Billboard Music Awards (23 wins). She has had eleven number-one songs on the Billboard Hot 100. In October 2023, she became a billionaire. She won Apple Music Artist of the Year in 2020 and 2023. Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] at Reading Hospital in West Reading, Pennsylvania, [2]the daughter of Scott Swift and Andrea Gardner.[3] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[4]She has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift.[5] Swift was raised in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania on a Christmas tree farm.[6] She became interested in musical theater when she was nine. Later, she became interested in country music. On weekends, she performed music at local events. She moved to Hendersonville, Tennessee, near Nashville, when she was 14.[7] Her family moved there to help Swift's career in country music. In Nashville, she went to Hendersonville High School for two years. After that, she went to Aaron Academy, because Aaron Academy made it easier for her to tour while in school. She graduated high school one year early. Additionally, at the age of 10, Swift won a poetry writing competition.[8] She released her first single, \"Tim McGraw\", in 2006 at the age of 16. That same year she released her first album, Taylor Swift. The album reached number 5 on the Billboard albums chart, and sold one million copies by November 2007. She won Country Music Television's (CMT) \"Breakthrough Video of the Year\" award in 2007 for \"Tim McGraw\". She was also nominated by the Academy of Country Music for \"Top New Female Vocalist\". Swift’s second studio album, Fearless, was released in 2008. On September 10, 2009 it reached Platinum, selling 1 million copies. On October 25, 2010 she released her third album, Speak Now. The lead single from Swift's fourth album, Red, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", became her first number-one song on the US Billboard Hot 100.

In 2012 Swift voiced the character Audrey in the movie The Lorax. Swift performed \"Shake It Off\", the lead single from her fifth album, 1989, at the 2014 MTV VMAs.[9] 1989 was released on October 27, 2014. \"Shake It Off\", along with the singles \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\", all reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. These singles, along with \"Style\" and \"Wildest Dreams\", have also topped the Mainstream Top 40/Pop Songs chart. 1989 was based off of Taylors birthday year, 1989. In 2016 she featured on the single, \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" with English singer Zayn Malik (former member of One Direction). It was released as a single for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). It reached number two on the Hot 100 in the US and Canada. On June 8, 2017, Swift restored her music on streaming sites such as Spotify and Apple Music after previously removing it from being streamed. On August 25, 2017, Swift released the single \"Look What You Made Me Do\", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 and broke YouTube's streaming record after getting 43 million views within 24 hours. It also became her first UK chart-topper. Swift announced that her sixth studio album, Reputation, would be released on November 10, 2017. The album included singles such as \"...Ready for It?\" and \"End Game\" featuring American rapper Future and English singer Ed Sheeran. During this era, she met backstage with global superstar Oliver Kang[source?] On April 26, 2019, Swift released the single \"ME!\" featuring Brendon Urie as the lead single from her seventh studio album, Lover. On June 14, 2019, Swift released Lover’s second single \"You Need to Calm Down\". Both of these songs reached number two on the US Hot 100. On August 16, Swift released \"Lover\" as the third single from Lover. She released a duet version of Lover with Canadian recording artist Shawn Mendes. In August 2020, Swift revealed that she was releasing a surprise album called folklore, after it was announced her Loverfest stadium tour was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Its lead single, \"cardigan\", entered at number one on the US Hot 100, becoming her sixth US number-one single. folklore became her seventh US number-one album. She became the first artist to enter at number one on both the Hot 100 singles chart and Billboard 200 album chart in the same week.[10] On December 11, 2020, Swift released her ninth studio album, evermore. It is meant to be a \"sister\" album to folklore.[11] Due to Swift not being able to own her own masters, she has begun re-recording all of her old albums. She released the first song from the re-recording of Fearless (Taylor's Version), \"Love Story\" on February 12, 2021. On November 12, 2021 she released Red (Taylor's Version). Swift's 10th studio album Midnights came out on October 21, 2022. In March 2023 Swift started her Eras Tour. The tour covers all her albums. The US part of the tour sold the most tickets in one day ever. Many people said that the company handling the ticket sales, Ticketmaster, did not do well.[12] The Eras Tour earned the most money of any tour in history. It earned over $1 billion.[13][14] During this time, she also released Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version). On February 4, 2024, Swift won Album of the Year at the 66th Grammy Awards. She was the first artist to win in this category four times.

Today she's the most recognizable country-- or formerly country? or pop?-- artist in North America, if not the world: her songwriting takes in half a dozen genres, and her economic impact changes cities. We will move through Swift's own catalogue, including hits, deep cuts, outtakes, re-recordings, considering songwriting as its own art, distinct from poems recited or silently read. We will learn how to study fan culture, celebrity culture, adolescence, adulthood and appropriation; how to think about white texts, Southern texts, transatlantic texts, and queer subtexts. We will learn how to think about illicit affairs, and hoaxes, champagne problems and incomplete closure. We will look at her precursors, from Dolly Parton to the Border Ballads, and at work about her (such as the documentary \"Miss Americana\"). And we will read literary works important to her and works about song and performance, with novels, memoirs and poems by (among others) Willa Cather, James Weldon Johnson, Tracey Thorn, and William Wordsworth.

                "content": "Friday the 13th is considered an unlucky day in Western superstition. It occurs when the 13th day of the month in the Gregorian calendar falls on a Friday, which happens at least once every year but can occur up to three times in the same year. For example, 2015 had a Friday the 13th in February, March, and November, which will happen again in 2026. Leap years that begin on Sunday (i.e. that follow Dominical Letter AG) such as 2012 and 2040, also have three Friday the 13ths in January, April, and July. 2017 through 2020 had two Friday the 13ths, as did 2023; 2016, 2021, and 2022 had just one Friday the 13th, as will 2025, 2027, and 2028; 2024 will have two Friday the 13ths.[1] For a month to have a Friday the 13th, the 1st must be a Sunday. One source mentioned for the unlucky reputation of the number 13 is a Norse myth about twelve gods having a dinner party in Valhalla. The trickster god Loki, who was not invited, arrived as the thirteenth guest, and arranged for Höðr, the god of darkness, to shoot Balder, the god of joy and gladness, with a mistletoe-tipped arrow. Balder died, triggering much suffering in the world, which caused the number 13 to be considered unlucky.[2][3] The superstition seems to relate to various things, like the story of Jesus's Last Supper and crucifixion in which there were thirteen individuals present in the Upper Room on the thirteenth of Nisan Maundy Thursday, the night before his death on Good Friday.[a][b][6] While there is evidence of both Friday[7] and the number 13[8] being considered unlucky, there is no record of the two items being referred to as especially unlucky in conjunction before the 19th century.[9][10] The Knights Templar Some cite the arrest of the Knights Templar on Friday, October 13, 1307, by officers of King Philip IV of France as the origin of the Friday the 13th superstition, but it is agreed the origins remain murky.[11] In France, Friday 13th might have been associated with misfortune as early as the first half of the 19th century. A character in the 1834 play Les Finesses des Gribouilles states, \"I was born on a Friday, December 13th, 1813 from which come all of my misfortunes\".[12] An early documented reference in English occurs in H. S. Edwards' biography of Gioachino Rossini, who died on Friday 13th of November 1868: It is possible that the publication in 1907 of T. W. Lawson's popular novel Friday, the Thirteenth,[14] contributed to popularizing the superstition. In the novel, an unscrupulous broker takes advantage of the superstition to create a Wall Street panic on a Friday the 13th.[9] Similar dates are prevalent in many cultures, although it is unclear whether these similarities are in any way historically connected or only coincidental. In Hispanic countries, instead of Friday, Tuesday the 13th (martes trece) is considered a day of bad luck.[15] The Greeks also consider Tuesday (and especially the 13th) an unlucky day.[16] Tuesday is considered dominated by the influence of Ares, the god of war (or Mars, the Roman equivalent). The fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade occurred on Tuesday 13 April 1204, and the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans happened on Tuesday 29 May 1453, events that strengthen the superstition about Tuesday. In addition, in Greek the name of the day is Triti (Τρίτη) meaning the third (day of the week), adding weight to the superstition, since bad luck is said to \"come in threes\".[16] There is a Tuesday the 13th in months that begin on a Thursday. In Italian popular culture, Friday the 17th (and not the 13th) is considered a bad luck day.[17] The origin of this belief could be traced in the writing of the number 17, in Roman numerals: XVII. By shuffling the digits of the number one can get the Latin vīxī (\"I have lived\", implying death at present), an omen of bad luck.[18] In fact, in Italy, 13 is generally considered a lucky number,[19] although some people may consider 13 an unlucky number as well due to Americanization. The 2000 parody film Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth was released in Italy with the title Shriek – Hai impegni per venerdì 17? (\"Shriek – Do You Have Something to Do on Friday the 17th?\").[citation needed] According to the Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute in Asheville, North Carolina, an estimated 17–21 million people in the United States are affected by a fear of this day, making it the most feared day and date in history. Some people are so paralyzed by fear that they avoid their normal routines in doing business, taking flights or even getting out of bed. It has been estimated that US$ 800–900 million is lost in business on this day.[20] Despite this, representatives for both Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines (the latter now merged into United Airlines) have stated that their airlines do not suffer from any noticeable drop in travel on those Fridays.[21] In Finland, a consortium of governmental and nongovernmental organizations led by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health promotes the National Accident Day (kansallinen tapaturmapäivä) to raise awareness about automotive safety, which always falls on a Friday the 13th.[22] The event is coordinated by the Finnish Red Cross and has been held since 1995.[23] A study by Scanlon, Luben, Scanlon, & Singleton (1993)[24] attracted attention from popular science literature,[c][d] as it concluded that \"the risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52 percent on the 13th\";[24]: 1584 however, the authors clearly state that \"the numbers of admissions from accidents are too small to allow meaningful analysis\".[24]: 1586 Subsequent studies have disproved any correlation between Friday the 13th and the rate of accidents.[27][28] On 12 June 2008 the Dutch Centre for Insurance Statistics stated to the contrary, that \"fewer accidents and reports of fire and theft occur when the 13th of the month falls on a Friday than on other Fridays, because people are preventatively more careful or just stay home. Statistically speaking, driving is slightly safer on Friday the 13th, at least in the Netherlands; in the last two years, Dutch insurers received reports of an average 7,800 traffic accidents each Friday; but the average figure when the 13th fell on a Friday was just 7,500.\"[29][30] Each 400 year Gregorian solar cycle contains 146,097 days (with 97 leap days) or exactly 20,871 weeks. Each cycle contains the same pattern of days of the week and therefore the same pattern of Fridays that are on the 13th. The 13th day of the month is very slightly more likely to be a Friday than any other day of the week.[31][32][33] Any month that starts on a Sunday contains a Friday the 13th, and there is at least one Friday the 13th in every calendar year. The months with a Friday the 13th are determined by the Dominical letter (G, F, GF, etc.) of the year. Years which begin on the same day of the week and are of the same type (i.e. common year or leap year), will have a Friday the 13th in the same months. This sequence, given here for 1900–2099, follows a 28-year cycle from 1 March 1900 to 28 February 2100: Although there is always at least one Friday the 13th per calendar year, it can be as long as 14 months between two Friday the 13ths.[34] The longest period that occurs without a Friday the 13th is 14 months, either from July to September the following year being a common year starting on Tuesday (F) (e.g. 2001–02, 2012–13 and 2018–19), or from August to October the following year being a leap year starting on Saturday (BA) (e.g. 1999–2000 and 2027–28). The shortest period that occurs with a Friday the 13th is just one month, from February to March in a common year starting on Thursday (D) (e.g. 2009, 2015 and 2026). On average, there is a Friday the 13th once every 212.35 days. Friday the 13ths occurs with an average frequency of 1.7218 per year or about 3477 since the year 1 CE. There can be no more than three Friday the 13ths in a single calendar year; either in February, March, and November in a common year starting on Thursday (such as 2009, 2015, or 2026) (D), or January, April, and July in a leap year starting on Sunday (such as 1984, 2012, or 2040) (AG).[35] In the 2000s, there were three Friday the 13ths in 2009, and two Friday the 13ths in 2001, 2002, 2006, and 2007. In the 2010s, there were three Friday the 13ths in 2012 and 2015, and two in 2013, 2017, 2018, and 2019.[1] In the 2020s, there were two Friday the 13ths in 2020 and 2023. There will also be three Friday the 13ths in 2026, and two in 2024 and 2029.[1] The remaining years all have at least one Friday the 13th.[1] For the details see the table below; this table is for the Gregorian calendar and Jan/Feb for leap years:",

                "content": "By: History.com Editors Updated: August 10, 2021 | Original: October 10, 2017 Long considered a harbinger of bad luck, Friday the 13th has inspired a late 19th-century secret society, an early 20th-century novel, a horror film franchise and not one but two unwieldy terms—paraskavedekatriaphobia and friggatriskaidekaphobia—that describe fear of this supposedly unlucky day. Just like walking under a ladder, crossing paths with a black cat or breaking a mirror, many people hold fast to the belief that Friday the 13th brings bad luck. Though it’s uncertain exactly when this particular tradition began, negative superstitions have swirled around the number 13 for centuries. While Western cultures have historically associated the number 12 with completeness (there are 12 days of Christmas, 12 months and zodiac signs, 12 labors of Hercules, 12 gods of Olympus and 12 tribes of Israel, just to name a few examples), its successor 13 has a long history as a sign of bad luck. The ancient Code of Hammurabi, for example, reportedly omitted a 13th law from its list of legal rules. Though this was probably a clerical error, superstitious people sometimes point to this as proof of 13’s longstanding negative associations. Fear of the number 13 has even earned a psychological term: triskaidekaphobia. According to biblical tradition, 13 guests attended the Last Supper, held on Maundy Thursday, including Jesus and his 12 apostles (one of whom, Judas, betrayed him). The next day, of course, was Good Friday, the day of Jesus’ crucifixion. The seating arrangement at the Last Supper is believed to have given rise to a longstanding Christian superstition that having 13 guests at a table was a bad omen—specifically, that it was courting death. Though Friday’s negative associations are weaker, some have suggested they also have roots in Christian tradition: Just as Jesus was crucified on a Friday, Friday was also said to be the day Eve gave Adam the fateful apple from the Tree of Knowledge, as well as the day Cain killed his brother, Abel. In the late-19th century, a New Yorker named Captain William Fowler (1827-1897) sought to remove the enduring stigma surrounding the number 13—and particularly the unwritten rule about not having 13 guests at a dinner table—by founding an exclusive society called the Thirteen Club. The group dined regularly on the 13th day of the month in room 13 of the Knickerbocker Cottage, a popular watering hole Fowler owned from 1863 to 1883. Before sitting down for a 13-course dinner, members would pass beneath a ladder and a banner reading “Morituri te Salutamus,” Latin for “Those of us who are about to die salute you.” Four former U.S. presidents (Chester A. Arthur, Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison and Theodore Roosevelt) would join the Thirteen Club’s ranks at one time or another. The much‑feared day was the beginning of the end for the powerful warriors. The ancient Babylonian king ruled with military and diplomatic finesse—and he also knew a thing or two about self‑promotion. Symbols, amulets and other talismans from around the globe. An important milestone in the history of the Friday the 13th legend in particular (not just the number 13) occurred in 1907, with the publication of the novel Friday, the Thirteenth written by Thomas William Lawson. The book told the story of a New York City stockbroker who plays on superstitions about the date to create chaos on Wall Street, and make a killing on the market. The horror movie Friday the 13th, released in 1980, introduced the world to a hockey mask-wearing killer named Jason, and is perhaps the best-known example of the famous superstition in pop culture history. The movie spawned multiple sequels, as well as comic books, novellas, video games, related merchandise and countless terrifying Halloween costumes. On Friday, October 13, 1307, officers of King Philip IV of France arrested hundreds of the Knights Templar, a powerful religious and military order formed in the 12th century for the defense of the Holy Land. Imprisoned on charges of various illegal behaviors (but really because the king wanted access to their financial resources), many Templars were later executed. Some cite the link with the Templars as the origin of the Friday the 13th superstition, but like many legends involving the Templars and their history, the truth remains murky. In more recent times, a number of traumatic events have occurred on Friday the 13th, including the German bombing of Buckingham Palace (September 1940); the murder of Kitty Genovese in Queens, New York (March 1964); a cyclone that killed more than 300,000 people in Bangladesh (November 1970); the disappearance of a Chilean Air Force plane in the Andes (October 1972); the death of rapper Tupac Shakur (September 1996) and the crash of the Costa Concordia cruise ship off the coast of Italy, which killed 30 people (January 2012). “The Origins of Unlucky Friday the 13th,” Live Science.“Friday the 13th: why is it unlucky and other facts about the worst day in the calendar,” The Telegraph.“13 Freaky Things That Happened on Friday the 13th,” Live Science.“Here’s Why Friday the 13th is Considered Unlucky,” Time.“Friggatriskaidekaphobes Need Not Apply,” New-York Historical Society.

                "content": "By Kaity Kline circa 1930: Members of Friday The Thirteenth Club walk under a ladder in single file at a meeting on the outskirts of Paris. The club meets every Friday 13th to do everything that superstitious people traditionally avoid. Hulton Archive/Keystone/Getty Images hide caption The superstition that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day has been around for the past 100 years. But it doesn’t have the ancient origins that many might expect. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why Friday the 13th is considered an unlucky day. Experts can only speculate. “The United States, we get it from England… it wasn’t considered an unlucky day in England until the 20th century. The first recorded instance we have of that in print is 1913,” said Moira Marsh, a folklore librarian at the University of Indiana Bloomington. “People start to make references to it being unlucky without saying why they think it’s unlucky. And because of that, typically what you get is all kinds of wild theories about why Friday the 13th is unlucky,” said Stephen Winick, a folklore specialist at the American Folklife Center of The Library of Congress. Some speculate that Friday the 13th is unlucky because Judas was the 13th guest at the Last Supper, or that Knights Templar were condemned on a Friday the 13th. But Winick said experts don’t know if any of those things are true. The first references Winick has seen saying Friday the 13th is unlucky are both from French writing and plays. A character in the 1834 play Les Finesses des Gribouilles says \"I was born on a Friday, December 13th, 1813 from which come all of my misfortunes.\" And in the French literary magazine Revue de Paris, Marquis de Salvo wrote about a father who killed his daughter on Friday the 13th, and said “It is always Fridays and the number thirteen that bring back luck.” While the combination of Friday and 13 is a relatively new invention, the idea that Fridays are unlucky is not. “Fridays were considered unlucky days, and that’s been true since the Middle Ages in the English speaking world and probably through most of Europe, because Friday was the day of crucifixion. And in the old Catholic tradition, every Friday was a day of penance. And that idea has persisted,” said Marsh. Marsh said the idea that 13 is an unlucky number doesn’t really show up until around the 17th century. “Before that, it might have been considered a good number because it goes back to supposedly the 13 people who were at the Last Supper. Before reformation, Christians preferred to try and emulate that.” After the Reformation came along, Marsh said ideas like that were forbidden as superstitious. And so what was considered a good number flipped to be considered a bad one. There’s another idea about why the number 13 is unlucky. “12 is a number that’s very mathematically significant. It’s divisible by many different numbers. And it’s very useful mathematically for various things,” said Winick. There are 12 months, 12 zodiac signs, 12 inches in a foot. “And then 13 comes along and it’s kind of a dud. It doesn’t really help you out much mathematically.” Marsh and Winick say that thanks to popular culture, like the movie Friday the 13th, the day is now pretty widespread in countries around the world. And journalists have had a hand in spreading the popularity of that idea. In Italy, Winick said, the unlucky day tends to be Friday the 17th. And then in Spanish speaking countries, the unlucky day tends to be Tuesday the 13th. “People speculate that’s because Tuesday is associated with the chaotic God of war. You know, Martes or Tuesday in Spanish is related to the God of war, Mars. Because of that, people think that may be the origin of Tuesday’s being unlucky,” said Winick. Marsh said a Greek nurse in the 1960s may be another source who found Tuesdays to be unlucky. According to this nurse, if a wedding ended on a Monday evening, the women of the family would keep the bridge close by so that her husband wouldn’t touch her. Because if any child was conceived on a Monday evening, the beginning of Tuesday would be considered unlucky, and the baby would likely have birth defects. In Greece, Winick said they often link the potential origins back to ancient Greek culture. So they’ll think about ancient Greek mathematics, which had ideas that the number 12 was a good number, and 13 was a bad number. “We seek explanations for the chaotic experience of life. We want to explain to ourselves why things have happened in a certain way, why things didn’t go our way… it gives us a sense of control even though we may not have control,” said Winick.

                "content": "The calendar has flipped to September which means people are preparing for spooky season with Halloween decorations, bonfires and pumpkin-flavored everything. While Halloween is a spooky day in its own right, many people also feel uneasy and unlucky on Friday the 13th. This year will see the date occur twice, in September and December. The next one after December won't occur until June 2025. Fear and anxiety about the day may have been amplified by the slasher-movie series featuring Jason Voorhees, but where did the superstition originate? Here's what to know. Why do some get ink on Friday the 13th?How the day became lucky for the tattoo industry According to National Geographic Kids, the exact origins of when Friday the 13th became thought of as unlucky are unknown, however it \"likely comes from the Christian religion.\" \"For example, in the Bible, Judas — a person who is said to have betrayed Jesus — was the 13th guest at the Last Supper. Also in the Bible, many unfortunate things happened on Fridays,\" according to National Geographic Kids. Friday the 13th combines two taboos that come from the bible, according to Dr. Phil Stevens, a retired anthropology professor from the University at Buffalo and the author of a book titled \"Rethinking the Anthropology of Magic and Witchcraft: Inherently Human.\" Based on the story of the Last Supper of Jesus, 13 people were seated at the table and it happened on a Thursday. He was arrested that evening, and crucified the next day, on a Friday. \"So 13 is associated with that terrible event. And Friday, the 13th you get a double whammy. You get both of these elements coming together: the taboo against 13, and the crucifixion, which was on a Friday,\" Stevens said in an interview with USA TODAY last year. Even though the taboo is tied to the Last Supper, Stevens said it didn't become widespread until 1,000 years after Jesus's story when more people became interested in the bible. Now he thinks the taboo is weakening as people embrace the number 13 more, and it is only a matter of time before it phases out. Stevens also talked about how the day is an example of \"magical thinking.\" Stevens said that he likes to think of the superstition around Friday the 13th as an example of magical thinking. He says that magical thinking is when someone believes is there is a causal relationship between two things that are otherwise unrelated. For example, Friday and 13 together take on a different quality when they fall on the same day. He also said he thinks of it as a taboo, as superstition has a negative connotation, even when someone uses it to describe their own belief. \"The word taboo actually is appropriate for this kind of a superstition. Because it's the it's the term that means avoiding establishing a magical connection. People can actively work magic to make things happen, recognizing the connections between things, but if the connections between things could cause an unfortunate result, then people avoid those connections.\" Stevens said at the time. Some people look for positive connections between things. For example, China kicked off the Olympics in 2008 at 8:08 p.m. on the eight day of the eight month because the number is associated with good luck. Another example is when someone has a good luck charm or assigns a higher value to an item after it has belonged to a celebrity, Stevens said. Friday the 13th is something of a Black Friday for tattoo shops. Many shops run special promotions charging steeply discounted prices to get work done, often for a flat rate at or even under shop minimum (the minimum fee a shop will usually charge on a tattoo to cover the cost of the basic supplies and overhead). The average hourly price most artists charge is between $100 to $200 plus, making these flash sales a great deal. While affordable predesigned flash tattoos and flash sales are not uncommon practices throughout the rest of the calendar year, Friday the 13th is the one day you can depend on finding a wealth of markdowns at multiple shops near you. The modern model for Friday the 13th as a tattoo holiday is often credited back to co-owner of Elm Street Tattoo in Dallas Oliver Peck, who you may recognize from TV show \"Ink Master\" and his brief marriage to Kat Von D (he has since been remove from the show due to a blackface controversy). Peck previously told Vice that he \"definitely wasn't the first person to do it,\" saying he drew some inspiration from fellow artist Dave Lum's Halloween specials, but that he did \"make it an event.\" He threw his first major Friday the 13th function in 1995 at the now-defunct Pair O' Dice in Dallas, a marathon session of tattooing the number \"13\" on as many people as possible in a 24-hour period. His swing at creating his own tradition caught on, as he and his co-workers began hosting these 24-hour tattoathons each year, at one point winning a spot in Guinness Book of World Records for tattooing the number 13 on 415 people in 24 hours on Friday, June 13, 2008.

Battle overwhelming threats OK, here’s the reality: everything, on every planet, wants you dead. This is the life of a Helldiver. School yourself on the diabolical Terminids and the nefarious Automaton Collective. An ancient, “highly advanced” species, desperately seeking to reclaim their former galactic supremacy. These mind-controlling, xenophobic aliens cannot be reasoned with. They must all be killed. The Voteless The Voteless are former loyal citizens of Super Earth, warped by Illuminate experimentation into mindless soldiers for their despotic regime. They have been stripped of something even deeper than their humanity: their capacity to participate in the Democratic process. The Watcher Watchers are the eyes of the Illuminate. These floating droids scan for free-thinking lifeforms, and report them to their masters for enslavement or eradication. Overseer Centuries old, Overseers are formidable, calculating warriors armed with arcane weaponry. They bend the Voteless to their will, using them as expendable shields in a craven attempt to conserve their own numbers. Harvester These spindly machines stalk the battlefield, reaping patriotic innocents with their cycloptic death beam. They see with only one eye, emblematic of the limited, closed-minded perspective of the entire Illuminate species. The ravenous Terminids are guided solely by an instinctive urge to reproduce, spread, and destroy Democracy. They are a fast-evolving plague, a shapeshifting infestation that threatens to devour and disenfranchise every single child on every single planet. Scavenger The brainless Scavenger is the lowliest of Terminids. Upon encountering an agent of Liberty, it emits a piercing scream that attracts nearby bugs in a reflexive attempt to destroy Freedom. Warrior Warriors are the natural end result of a species optimized for mindless expansion. In controlled environments, they have eviscerated innocent baby cows in under a second. One can only imagine what they would do to innocent baby humans. Hunter The pesky Hunters are known to dodge incoming fire with swift leaps. Scientists note that while this behavior might appear intelligent, it is merely a base instinct, akin to a housefly avoiding an incoming swat. Stalker A side effect of Terminid gene splicing research, Stalkers can camouflage themselves almost to the point of invisibility. But nothing can hide from the cleansing light of Freedom forever. Bile Spewer Bile Spewers appeared following unavoidable spills of toxic chemicals on Terminid E-710 farms. The Bile Spewer’s thorax is bloated with several metric tons of corrosive acid, which it vomits in revulsion upon encountering Democracy. Bile Titan The largest known Terminid strain, a single Bile Titan can destroy an entire SEAF platoon on its own. Engagement is not recommended without the support of heavy duty Orbital Stratagems or a high personnel replacement budget. Charger A rushing Charger is nearly impossible to stop, thanks to its meter-thick exoskeleton. Therefore, the recommended response protocol to this situation is the prompt execution of a Rapid Lateral Movement (RLM). Brood Commander Directing its foul brethren with a mixture of pheromone-like spores and authoritarian shrieks, the bloodthirsty Brood Commander is a rare and deadly strain known for its undeniable hatred of the right to vote. The Automatons are mindless, bloodthirsty robots, coded for nothing but murder and socialist violence. Their origins are a mystery, but their unthinking hatred of Freedom makes them a threat to all citizens of Super Earth. Trooper, Raider, Marauder Troopers are little more than guns with legs, base caricatures of consciousness fused to machine guns and rocket launchers. Unlike Super Earth, the bots seem to believe that strapping heavy weaponry to expendable cannon fodder is the solution to every problem. Commissar A crude simulation of military leadership, the Commissar is augmented with slightly faster processing and a crude command subroutine. The Commissar stays out of combat if possible, as despicably cowardly as it is unequivocally non-sentient. Scout Strider The Scout Strider is a machine operated by a machine, a walking turret guided by the limited intelligence of an Automaton Trooper. Another fruitless attempt to ape true intelligence, in this case by exercising mastery over a machine even more primitive than themselves. Berserker A primitive actualization of barbarity, the Berserker has CPUs in each chainsaw that are programmed to solve one problem: closing the space between saw and target as quickly as possible. Devastator The ironclad Devastator seeks to crush opponents of the Automatons’ totalitarian worldview with a diverse array of heinous weaponry: arm-cannons, arm-shields, arm-machineguns and arm-rocket-launchers. Variants: Armcannon (Base), MG/Heavy, Rocket. Hulk As with all Automaton units, the plodding Hulk is brainlessly optimized to do nothing except deliver heavy firepower. If encountered, the recommended protocol for Helldivers is to immediately call in the largest orbital bombardment available. Variants: Autocannon/Rocket, Flame, Rocket. Tank Shamelessly copied from Super Earth tank designs, the Automaton Tank is clearly inferior in such a multitude of aspects that it would be impractical to list them here. Variants: Heavy Cannon, Quad HMG. Dropship Packed to the brim with robotic infantry, Dropships conduct rapid deployment of mindless, mechanized despotism.

                "content": "Helldivers 2 is a 2024 cooperative third-person shooter game developed by Arrowhead Game Studios and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 5 and Windows. The game is the direct sequel to Helldivers, a 2015 top-down shooter. Helldivers 2 was released on 8 February 2024 and received positive reviews from critics. The game sold in excess of 12 million copies within three months of its release, becoming PlayStation's fastest selling title of all time, as well as Sony's most successful Windows title. It was nominated for and won a number of awards and is considered amongst the best video games of 2024.[2][3][4][5][6] Helldivers 2 is a shooter game primarily played from a third-person perspective.[7] Players complete tasks (called \"Missions\") in procedurally generated levels (or \"Operations\") while fending off hordes of enemies. Players choose the difficulty level of their Operations, ranging from level 1 (Trivial) to level 10 (Super Helldive).[8] A core gameplay feature carried over from the first game is the use of \"Stratagems\" - powerful equipment which must be called in from orbit by executing a sequence of D-pad or arrow key inputs. Players may select up to four Stratagems in advance to take into the mission with them, as well as a \"Booster\" which affects the whole team.[9] Helldivers 2 features cooperative multiplayer with up to four players,[7] but does not include a dedicated single-player campaign.[10] It also provides optional cross-play between PlayStation 5 and Windows.[11] Friendly fire is always on.[12] In the initial days of release, gameplay involved staff at the studio observing players and influencing gameplay in real time.[13] The game features a battle pass system called \"Warbonds\" that never expire. As of 12 December 2024, ten Warbonds have been released: \"Helldivers Mobilize\", \"Steeled Veterans\", \"Cutting Edge\", \"Democratic Detonation\", \"Polar Patriots\", \"Viper Commandos\", \"Freedom's Flame\", \"Chemical Agents\", \"Truth Enforcers\", and \"Urban Legends\".[14][15][16][17] Players can earn different types of in-game currency during gameplay: \"Warbond Medals\" and \"Requisition Slips\" are awarded for completing Operations, missions and game objectives; while \"Super Credits\" can either be found during missions or purchased via microtransactions.[18] As players gain experience and progress in levels, they unlock different weapons and Stratagems to use during missions.[19] Players can collect also \"Samples\", which are used to upgrade the player's Super Destroyer, providing advantages during gameplay.[20] By completing Operations, players also contribute to the collective progress of \"Major Orders\", which are mass-collaborative missions that directly affect the outcome of the Galactic War in-game.[9][21] Helldivers 2 is set a century after the triumph of \"Super Earth\", a self-described managed democracy, over the Bugs, Cyborgs, and Illuminate in Helldivers. It is discovered that the blood of the Bugs contains a unique and highly valuable resource known as \"E-710\". Bug farms are established on human-colonized worlds, and after decades of genetic engineering and accelerated evolution, they become Terminids. Eventually, containment of the Terminids is breached and the creatures are released, causing widespread chaos and destruction. Simultaneously, a new threat emerges in the form of the Automatons, descendants of the defeated Cyborgs, intent on getting revenge against humanity. Subsequently, the Illuminate, an ancient alien race believed to have been defeated, return and invade Super Earth's colonies.[22] [23] Environmental storytelling is prevalent throughout the game, with various logs, notes, and propaganda messages available for players to find during gameplay.[24] On 3 December 2020, Arrowhead Game Studios revealed that work had started on a new project for PlayStation 5. It was confirmed that the game would be a third-person shooter.[25] Like the first game, Helldivers 2 runs on the discontinued Autodesk Stingray game engine (originally known as Bitsquid). Arrowhead Game Studios founder Johan Pilestedt confirmed on social media that \"The project started before [Stingray] was discontinued,\" adding, \"Our crazy engineers had to do everything, with no support to build the game to parity with other engines.\"[26][27] On 13 September 2021, Helldivers 2 was mentioned in a GeForce Now leak.[28] The game was teased in a TikTok post showing Arrowhead's social media manager starting their workday, which is followed by a series of posts from fans demanding them to release the game.[29] On 18 August 2022, a 12-second clip of gameplay was leaked on Twitter, but was later removed.[30][31] On 24 May 2023, Helldivers 2 was announced during the 2023 PlayStation Showcase, with a slated release of sometime in 2023.[32] On 6 July 2023, a trailer showcasing gameplay was released.[9][12] On 30 July 2023, the game received an M rating by the Entertainment Software Rating Board for \"blood and gore\" and \"intense violence\".[33] On 14 September 2023, gameplay was shown in a PlayStation State of Play event, and it was announced that the game would release on 8 February 2024.[34] Pre-orders became available on 22 September 2023.[35] On 8 February 2024, the game was released on the PlayStation Store and Steam.[36] Helldivers 2 received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic.[37][38] Upon release, the game experienced a large influx of players, leading to widespread server and login issues for the first two weeks of release.[53] By the third week of release, the player cap was increased to \"a whopping 700,000 concurrent users\" according to Wesley Yin-Poole of IGN.[54] Aaron Bayne of Push Square described the game as \"a riotous affair, offering up best-in-class gunplay\" and a \"truly epic and often cinematic experience, mixed in with one of the best co-op gameplay romps currently available.\" However, he criticized the game for the server issues and crashes that players experienced after release.[48] Helldivers 2 has been compared to the 1997 science fiction action film Starship Troopers; both are satirical comedies featuring a militaristic regime fighting against a race of large insectoids.[55][56] On February 11, 2024, Johan Pilestedt, then-CEO of Arrowhead Games, announced that Helldivers 2 had sold approximately 1 million units.[57] Helldivers 2 was the largest launch of any PlayStation Studios game available on PC.[58] Arrowhead stated that the game's success has greatly exceeded their expectations.[59] Following its initial success, Arrowhead Studios announced its intention to scale its studio and team to accelerate its post-launch content plans.[60][61] Pilestedt reacted to the game's ongoing success by stating that he hopes to see Helldivers become considered as iconic as PlayStation's other intellectual properties such as Uncharted, God of War, and Horizon.[62] In Europe, the United Kingdom, and Canada, Helldivers 2 was the best-selling game of February 2024.[63][64][65] Helldivers 2 remained the best selling game in Canada in April 2024 too.[66] By February 24, 2024, the game was estimated to have sold over 3 million units and became the most actively played game on the PlayStation Network, surpassing Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 and Fortnite.[67] By 15 March 2024, Helldivers 2 was estimated to have sold 8 million units and reached 450,000 concurrent players on Steam.[68] By 5 May 2024, 12 million units of the game had been sold, making it PlayStation's fastest selling video game of all time.[69] According to GameSpot as of 2 November 2024, Helldivers 2 was the second highest selling video game of the year in the United States.[70] At launch, Helldivers 2 did not require PC players to log into a PlayStation Network (PSN) account, allowing players to skip the integration despite a line on boot up stating that a PSN account is required. On May 3, 2024, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced that the PC version of Helldivers 2 on Steam would mandate users to sign in with a PSN account, taking effect for new players on May 6, 2024 and required for existing players by June 4, 2024. SIE stated that a PSN login is necessary to \"[uphold] the values of safety and security provided on PlayStation and PlayStation Studios games\", and that this requirement was not implemented at launch due to technical issues.[75] The announcement was met with criticism.[76] Additionally, many players called out that official documentation from Sony claimed that PSN accounts were optional for games on PC, with this statement changing to an ambiguous \"some games\" statement[77][78] after players were directed to contact Sony support by Pilestedt.[79] On 4 May, the listing on Steam was updated to disallow sales to 177 territories where PSN is not available.[80] Pilestedt apologized for the sudden change, stating on Twitter that \"I hope we will make it up and regain the trust by providing a continued great game experience\".[81] Arrowhead develpers stated that they were on the side of the players and one community manager even called for the player base to negatively review the game on Steam,[82] leading to players review bombing the game; as of 4 May, nearly 53% of all posted reviews were negative,[83][84][85] with over 84,000 negative reviews on Steam.[86] Sony announced on May 5, 2024 that they would not be moving forward with the account linking requirements, and promised to work with Arrowhead to find alternate solutions to protect players.[87] By July 2024, the PC player base dropped significantly, with a reported loss of up to 90% of players on Steam, equating to a low of just 35,000 players. The player drop was attributed to the PSN account controversy, player frustration with weapon balancing changes and increasingly tougher enemies, as well as bugs and performance issues.[88] In response, Arrowhead announced a 60-day plan to address these issues. In September and October 2024, two major patches were released as part of the 60-day plan, which aimed to re-evaluate weapon and enemy balancing, as well as fixperformance issues and bugs. The changes were positively received by the player base, which increased to over 100,000 and reviews once again become more positively aligned.[89]",

Karty made all four of his field goal attempts (48, 23, 27 and 29 yards) to account for all of Los Angeles' points. Williams gave them added security with an interception with 5:20 remaining in the fourth quarter led to the possession that drained that remaining clock down to just 19 seconds. Still, San Francisco had a last gasp from midfield because of a horse collar tackle penalty against cornerback Charles Woods. However, Rams linebacker Christian Rozeboom sacked 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy on the final play of the game to preserve the victory. Running back Kyren Williams was also instrumental in the major NFC West win, going for over 100 yards for a second time in his last three games. He had 29 carries for 108 in the victory. Notably, the Rams won the time of possession battle 35:04 to 24:56. Here is the complete game recap, presented by UNIFY: Both teams traded 3-and-outs at the start before the 49ers broke the game open with a 33-yard completion from Purdy to Kittle on their second series. Still, San Francisco was forced to settle for a 53-yard field goal by kicker Jake Moody at the end of that second drive, taking an early 3-0 lead. Off-and-on rain largely stalled any progress for the rest of the first half, though Los Angeles managed a 48-yard field goal by Karty to tie the game 3-3 with 1:05 left until halftime. The Rams ran 30 plays for 89 net yards and punted five times in the first half; the 49ers 31 for 108 with six. The Los Angeles Rams take on the San Francisco 49ers at Levi's Stadium in Week 15 of the 2024 season.

On the ensuing possession, the Rams went for it on 4th and 1 from the 49ers 37, and converted on a QB sneak by Matthew Stafford. While that drive was sustained, the 17-play, 65-yard drive that bled into the fourth quarter and erased nearly 10 minutes of game clock ended with a 23-yard field goal by Karty to tie the game 6-6 early in the fourth after the drive stalled at the 49ers 4-yard line. After an offensive pass interference penalty stalled the 49ers on the following series and forced them to punt, the Rams capitalized with a 51-yard completion from Stafford to Puka Nacua to bring them to the 49ers 16-yard line. However, the drive stalled at the 49ers 8, and the Rams were forced to settle for a 27-yard field goal by Karty for a 9-6 lead with 9:28 left in the fourth quarter. Los Angeles got a big break on the next drive when cornerback Darious Williams intercepted San Francisco quarterback Brock Purdy's deep pass down the right sideline intended for wide receiver Jauan Jennings, regaining possession with 5:14 left. On the ensuing series, Los Angeles brought the remaining clock all the way down to 18 seconds remaining, at which point Karty kicked a 29-yard field goal to put the Rams up 12-6 with that much time left. Placed at midfield because of the horse collar penalty on the ensuing kickoff, Rozeboom's sack on second down – after Purdy's incomplete pass on first down – secured the win. Cornerback Darious Williams' fourth-quarter interception helped the Rams come out with a hard-fought victory against the 49ers in Week 15.

                "content": "Anytime a defense holds a team to just six points, saying they played well is an understatement. The Rams came out and shut down a battered Niners offense, and in a rainy, sloppy game that didn't have a single big play or turnover, LA's defense came up with the play of the night. Darious Williams picked off Brock Purdy in the end zone to keep the Niners from taking the lead or tying it up with 5:00 to go. LA would drive down the field and kick an insurance field goal to go up 12-6 with under 20 seconds to go. The Rams stay alive in the air tight race for the NFC West while the Niners chances have just gone from almost impossible to virtually none. The rain let up a little in the 2nd half and both teams started to move the ball a little easier down the field, but that didn't translate to touchdowns. Stafford completed just four passes for 23 yards in the first half, but ended the night 16/27 for 160 yards. Puka Nacua had another stellar night despite the weather, going for 97 yards on 7 catches. The Los Angeles Rams still control their own playoff destiny after going into San Francisco and coming out with a huge divisional win on the road to keep pace in the NFC West. Darious Williams had the biggest play of the night, intercepting a pass late in the 4th quarter, but it was Josh Karty who lead the Rams past San Francisco scoring all 12 of LA's points, hitting all four of his field goals. It was an ugly game from start to finish as the wind and rain kept both offenses in check for most of the night. There were six punts in the first quarter and 11 in the first half. The Niners were the first ones on the board after Jake Moody hit a 52 yard field goal, but the Rams would eventually punch back. Kyren Williams put the team on his shoulders on a night that the offense couldn't find a groove. He had 108 yards on 29 carries just days after he carried the ball 29 times against the Bills.

The rain has apparently stopped. Let's see if that opens things up in the second 30 minutes. I wish we had some highlights to show, but the rain has really complicated things here in San Fran.

Quick pass to Samuel on the left side with the slant pattern but that pass was batted away by Witherspoon. 2nd and 10 from the SF 30. The Rams won the toss and differed so here comes Brock Purdy and the Niners to start the game from their 30. These rivalry games are always close to call, but I must say I was surprised to see the Rams as an underdog. After their win against the Bills last week, and with Nacua and Kupp healthy I think they have more weapons on the offensive end. If the Niners don’t have Joey Bosa, which looks like a real possibility, Stafford is going to have plenty of time to find his receivers and that could be a real problem for San Fran. The Niners know they can’t lose this game, but they have failed to show that champion resolve that they have been capable of showing over the last few years. Rams win 24-17. With four weeks to go, peeping at schedules has now become more important than ever. All four teams in the NFC West will want to stay in their lane, focused on winning their remaining games, but they will be tempted to look at the rest of the divisions’ remaining schedules, and so will we. The Seahawks have a couple tough games against NFC North opponents, LA control their own destiny with three of their four games against the other NFC West teams looking for the division title. Arizona have a couple of games against the league’s worst teams before taking on two NFC West opponents. Finally, the Niners have tonight’s game before heading to Miami and Detroit and finally a game in Arizona to wrap up the season. Seahawks: vs. GB, vs. MIN, @ CHI, @ LA Rams: @ SF, @ NYJ, vs. ARI, vs. SEA Cardinals: vs. NE, @ CAR, @ LA, Niners: vs. LA, @ MIA, vs. DET, @ ARI Taking a look at the NFC playoff picture, we see the Lions at the top of the conference and in the drivers seat for the one seed. The Eagles and Vikings are sitting right behind them waiting for any slip up from DET and then the Packers are sitting pretty for a Wild Card spot at 9-4. The Commanders are sitting just a game behind the Packers for the final Wild Card spot, but coming out of their BYE they might be looking over their shoulder at the NFC West teams chasing the Seahawks at the top of the division. While the Rams, Niners, and Cardinals will be chasing the Seahawks for the NFC West title, if the Commanders slip, a team from this division could sneak into a Wild Card spot that has looked like Washington’s for most of this season. After injuries to McCaffery and Brandon Aiyuk, even more responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of Brock Purdy who snapped out of his three game slump during the Niners three game slide. He had less than 200 yards in all three of those game, and just 94 yards on a snowy night in Buffalo. Last week he had a much needed 300 yard game as the Niners wiped the floor with the Bears. Lately it’s been Jauan Jenning and George Kittle stepping up and catching the majority of the passes, but were are going to see a little more of Deebo Samuel who had to clarify a message that he later deleted saying “Not struggling at all, just not getting the ball.” All of these struggles, and internal struggles can be calmed with a win tonight. But if the Niners lose, watch out. This once rock solid franchise could be approaching some choppy waters in the Bay. When Matt Stafford has time in the pocket, he is maybe the best quarterback in the league. The problem is he doesn’t always have the time in the pocket to let his receivers routes develop. Since Puka and Cooper have come back, teams are having to balance their pressure up front with coverage in the secondary and that indecision has given Stafford more time and space to work with. He had 317 yards in the Week 1 loss to the Lions, and the his numbers dipped as his two top receivers were sidelined with injuries. Since they came back, he’s had five games of 280 yards or more, and six of those seven games since the WR duo came back, Nacua has been the top receiver going for over 100 yards in four of those games. Stafford still uses Kupp as his security blanket, but Nacua is his new top target, and the game in Buffalo was added proof that the second year man isn’t just the best WR in LA, he might be the best receiver in the league. The Niners season has been marred by injuries since before kicking off Week 1. After just missing out on the Super Bowl last year, there were high hopes for this team, but those hopes would turn to despair as Christian McCaffery was a late scratch in Week 1, with an achilles injury that would turn into something much more serious than originally thought. He had to miss the first eight games of the season and the Niners went 4-4 in that time. He returned for the Niners game in Tampa Bay and things looked like they were going to turn around as San Fran climbed above .500 and they had their star back. A three game losing streak has set them back in the race for the NFC West after losses to Seattle, Green Bay and Buffalo, and now they are hanging on by a thread following their first blowout win over Chicago last week. It’s all or nothing for Purdy and the Niners, who have been hearing rumblings that this could mark the end of the San Francisco reign in the NFC. The Rams’ season, like a lot of teams, has been dramatically affected by injury. Luckily for them most of those injuries came early in the season and they have had time to recover and get healthy for the most important stretch of the campaign. After taking the Detroit Lions to OT and losing in Week 1 to show the world that they can compete with the top teams in the league, they started the season 1-4, and were in a bad spot a month into the season. Puka and Kupp came back in the same game and all of the sudden things started to turn around in LA. They have won six of their last eight and are now righting the thick of the division race, but none of those wins were bigger or more important than the one last week against the Bills. That showed that this team is healthy, and ready to compete again with the best teams in the league. The Niners could have just thrown in the towel last week after seeing Christian McCaffery go down for what is potentially a season ending injury. Instead they came out and gave their most resounding performance of the season, dominating the Chicago Bears from start to finish. The defense looked like the defense that has been the back bone of this team for the last five years, holding the Bears to just four yards in the first half. The Niners offense, meanwhile, went up 24-0 before the halftime break thanks to a pair of Brock Purdy TDs to Jauan Jennings and a rushing TD from Isaac Guerendo. Guerendo would get another one before the afternoon was done, ending his day with 78 yards and two TDs on 15 carries and Purdy had his best day of the season going for 325 yards and a couple TDs on 20/25 passing. Could this have been the game they needed to kick start a sprint to the finish line? We will find out tonight from Levi’s Stadium. The Rams hosted one of the hottest teams in the league last week and outlasted the Buffalo Bills in the highest scoring game of the year. Matthew Stafford and Josh Allen went toe to toe in a heavyweight bout that went all 12 rounds. Kyren Williams ran in the opening TD of the game on the first drive of the afternoon, but the Bills responded with a TD of their own. LA kicked a field goal on their next possession, and then blocked a punt that was taken back for a TD to go up 17-7 early in the 2nd quarter. Puka Nacua ran in a TD late in the 2nd quarter to put the Rams up 24-14, and on the other side of the halftime break Williams ran in his second TD of the day to go up 31-14 midway through the third quarter. Josh Allen would will his side back into the game, becoming the first player in the history of the league to score six TDs, three passing TDs and three rushing TDs. With the Rams holding on to a three point lead, Stafford led an 11 play drive that included a 4th and 5 conversion at the BUF 35 to extend the drive and set up a 19 yard TD catch and run from Nacua. Stafford ended the night with 320 yards and 2 TDs while Nacua had 162 yards and 1 TD receiving and another rushing TD to keep the Rams just a game behind the division leading Seahawks. Hello everyone and welcome to the Bay Area where we the Niners no their lives are on the line tonight. They come in to the final stretch of the season banged up, missing their super star running back, and under .500, but they still have a slight chance of winning the division. The Niners know they have to win each of their next four games to even have a chance at a playoff spot, but before they worry about the rest of their games, they have to survive tonight’s game against the Rams. LA has bounced back after a terrible start to the season and are now sitting a game back of the Seahawks after getting healthy and winning six of their last eight games. They currently control their own destiny, and if they win the rest of their remaining games they win the division and are in the playoffs. If they lose tonight, things much more complicated, which is why tonight is such a big game for both teams. With just four weeks to go there is no margin for error for any team in the NFL’s tightest division. All four teams in the NFC West are still alive with less than a month to go in the regular season but the loser of tonight’s game will be on the brink of elimination. It’s a playoff atmosphere here in San Francisco as the 49ers host the LA Rams in a rivlary match up that is going to keep one team in the race and most likely end the other teams season.

                "content": "NFL games are a spectrum. Some are back-and-forth shootouts. Others are duds without much scoring at all. The Los Angeles Rams have played games on each extreme in a four-day span and come out on top in both. Following their Week 14 shootout win over the Buffalo Bills, their Week 15 defeat of the San Francisco 49ers on “Thursday Night Football” landed more on the “dud” end. The Rams took home the critical divisional win, 12-6, on a rainy night in Santa Clara. The poor weather conditions played a major part in the low-scoring affair punctuated by drops, overthrows and many, many punts. In the end, neither team was able to find the end zone, so all of the scoring on Thursday night came exclusively in the form of field goals. Ultimately, a Darious Williams interception of 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy late in the fourth quarter sealed the win for Los Angeles. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. The win put the Rams within half a game of the Seattle Seahawks for the NFC West lead, and it sent the 49ers two games below .500. Here’s the full story of how it happened: NEVER MISS A SNAP: Sign up for our NFL newsletter for exclusive content A third consecutive Rams drive ended with a field goal as Los Angeles built a seemingly unsurmountable six-point lead with 18 seconds remaining in the game. Darious Williams' interception set up the scoring drive, which went 69 yards on 13 plays and milked 4:56 of the game clock to give the 49ers precious few seconds to work with on offense. The 49ers made it into Los Angeles territory for a few plays, but an overthrown Brock Purdy pass intended for Jauan Jennings ended up in Darious Williams' hands. The Rams take over possession at their own 20-yard line after the interception and touchback. Los Angeles has come up short in the red zone on back-to-back drives in the fourth quarter. Still, Joshua Karty's third field goal of the night was enough to give the Rams the lead for the first time. It's 9-6 Los Angeles with 9:28 minutes to go. On the first play of the Rams' second fourth quarter possession, Matthew Stafford heaved a 51-yard pass down field to find Puka Nacua. The longest play of the game by far gave Los Angeles the ball on the 49ers' 16-yard line. However, the Rams were not able to achieve a first down and had to settle for another field goal attempt. Despite having a second-and-3 at the 4-yard line to start the fourth quarter, the Rams are unable to get in the end zone. They settle for a 23-yard field goal instead. It's 6-6 with 13:38 left to play. The only scores have been a few field goals so far through 45 minutes. However, the Rams will begin the fourth quarter on San Francisco's 4-yard line. The weather seems to have cleared up, setting up a potentially more exciting final 15 minutes of action. Wide receiver Deebo Samuel dropped a third-down pass that could have resulted in a first down, so the 49ers had to settle for a 47-yard field goal attempt. Jake Moody knocked it through to stay a perfect 2-for-2 on the night, and San Francisco takes the lead once again, 6-3, with 8:23 left in the third quarter. The first half of a game heavily affected by poor weather conditions was not much to write home about. The teams combined for just six points in a full 30 minutes of play, with each one kicking a single field goal. The Rams will receive the second half kickoff. The Rams took advantage of their good starting field position, and after over 20 minutes without another score, their kicker nailed his 48-yard field goal attempt to tie the game at 3. The 49ers will get one final possession with just over one minute to play before the half. The rain is coming down heavily in Santa Clara, and it has limited both teams' productivity. Receivers on both teams have been unable to haul in passes that hit them in the hands, and both quarterbacks have had some bad misses. Additionally, there have already been several potential interceptions that hit defenders in the chest before falling harmlessly to the ground. On a rainy night in Santa Clara, it's been a game dominated by defense through the first 15 minutes. Jake Moody's field goal five minutes into the game remains the only score of the game so far. The 49ers have the ball on their own 36-yard line to start the second quarter. On the first play of the Rams' ensuing drive, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford targeted Puka Nacua on a 7-yard pass. The second-year receiver bobbled the ball initially before pinning the ball against a 49ers defender's helmet and holding on as they fell to the ground. Los Angeles was ultimately unable to advance any further and ended their drive on a second straight three-and-out. Following back-to-back three-and-outs, the 49ers made it into Rams territory thanks to a 33-yard catch-and-run by tight end George Kittle. San Francisco kicker Jake Moody knocked through a 53-yard field goal after the drive stalled at the Los Angeles 35. It's 3-0 49ers after five minutes of action. The Rams travel north to Santa Clara to take on the 49ers in their home building. \"Thursday Night Football\" will exclusively stream on Amazon Prime Video for a national audience. Fans in the Los Angeles market hoping to catch the game on TV can watch on Fox 11, while those in San Francisco's viewing market can watch on Fox 2. Here's how the USA TODAY Sports staff feels the matchup between the Rams and 49ers will play out come kickoff: For viewers looking for the “TNF” matchup between the 49ers and Rams, you can tune to Amazon Prime Video. Al Michaels (play-by-play) and Kirk Herbstreit (analyst) will be in the broadcast booth for Prime Video, with Kaylee Hartung (sideline) and Terry McAulay (rules analyst) providing additional coverage.

Taylor Rooks is the feature reporter for Prime Video's \"Thursday Night Football\" coverage. Albert Breer provides reports and analysis. Both Nick Bosa and Dre Greenlaw will play against the Rams. For Greenlaw, Thursday night's game represents his first on-field action since suffering a bizarre Achilles injury in Super Bowl 58 while running back onto the field. While the 49ers offense will have Isaac Guerendo available, 11-time Pro Bowl offensive tackle Trent Williams is out. The 49ers are favorites to defeat the Rams, according to the BetMGM NFL odds.

Here are some of the best bets for tonight’s 49ers-Rams tilt. All odds are via BetMGM as of Thursday. Isaac Guerendo plans to play against the Rams on Thursday night, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. He left Sunday's win with what head coach Kyle Shanahan called a possible foot sprain. Guerendo didn't seem too concerned about his availability for \"Thursday Night Football,\" saying, via NBC Sports Bay Area, after the game that the team was just being cautious. The 49ers are a better team when they a variety of ways to get Deebo Samuel the ball, especially when the offense is missing players such as Christian McCaffrey and Brandon Aiyuk. The wideout is the second player in NFL history to register 4,000-plus receiving yards and 1,000-plus rushing yards in his first five seasons. Samuel should be a focal point of the 49ers offense if the team wants to defeat the Rams, get out of last place in the NFC West and make a late postseason surge. The 49ers seem to understand that after Samuel’s deleted social media post. — Tyler Dragon The “TNF” matchup between the 49ers and Rams is taking place at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Levi's Stadium opened in 2014. It was the host venue for Super Bowl 50, which was won by the Denver Broncos over the Carolina Panthers. Levi's Stadium also will host Super Bowl 60 on Feb. 8, 2026. ➤ Ranking NFL's stadiums from 1 to 30: Where does 49ers' Levi's Stadium rate? Game time temperatures at Levi's Stadium will be in the mid-50s, according to AccuWeather. There is a good chance for precipitation during the game. The Seahawks are currently in control of the NFC West, but the division is still very much up for grabs entering the remainder of the season. The Rams have the clearest path to challenging the Seahawks. They could earn a head-to-head sweep over the Seahawks, which could prove critical in deciding a two-team tiebreaker. The Rams also have the most games remaining against the division among the four teams. That gives Los Angeles a chance to improve its 2-1 divisional record. Getting to four wins would position the Rams to win that tiebreaker category, provided they beat the Seahawks in Week 18. No team has a bigger uphill battle to climb to win the NFC West than the 49ers. San Francisco only has one divisional win, and the best it can hope for in its two remaining head-to-head matchups is to split with the Rams and Cardinals. Both teams have already taken down the 49ers once this year. According to BetMGM Sportsbook, the 49ers have odds of +1000 to make the playoffs entering Week 15. That gives San Francisco a 9.09% chance of qualifying for the postseason. The 49ers' remaining four opponents have a combined winning percentage of .596, per Tankathon. That is tied for the fifth-hardest remaining schedule among the NFL's 32 teams. Below is a full look at San Francisco's schedule: The Rams' remaining four opponents have a combined winning percentage of .442, per Tankathon. That ranks 21st among the NFL's 32 teams, meaning that Los Angeles will finish the season with an easier schedule than average. Below is a full look at Los Angeles' schedule: The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl wins with six. The 49ers have eight total Super Bowl appearances and five rings to show for it, the most recent victory coming during the 1994 season in Super Bowl XXIX. The Rams have played in five Super Bowls — winning two, most recently Super Bowl 56 against the Cincinnati Bengals.

                "title": "Rams vs. 49ers score, takeaways: Los Angeles hands San Fran huge blow to playoff hopes in TD-less 'TNF' bout - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Los Angeles Rams defeated the 49ers 12-6 and improved to 8-7, while San Francisco falls to 6-8 with the loss. The \"Thursday Night Football\" divisional matchup was significantly impacted by weather, as rain poured down during the contest. San Francisco's playoff hopes took a big hit with the loss. The 49ers, already thin on offense due to injuries, needed the stars they had to step up, but that didn't happen. Not long after wide receiver Deebo Samuel tweeted that he isn't struggling, he just isn't getting the ball, he, for lack of a better term, struggled. Samuel dropped easy passes at key points, finishing with just three receptions on six targets, totaling 16 yards. The theme of the game was punts, field goals and missed opportunities. We saw 13 punts through 60 minutes of play, including 11 in the first quarter, which was tied for the most of any game this season. Things began with the teams exchanging a pair of three-and-outs and we saw more of that through the night. Neither team reached the red zone until the fourth quarter. The first half ended at 3-3, after both teams kicked long field goals to get on the board. The Niners were first on the board, thanks to a 53-yard field goal from Jake Moody. It took until nearly the end of the second quarter, but the Rams responded with a field goal of their own, a 48 yarder from Joshua Karty. Moody kicked a 47 yarder to take a brief lead, before Karty's 23 yarder tied it at 6-6 with just over 13 minutes to go in the game. The Rams took their first lead of the game with, you guessed it: a field goal. The drive began with one of the most thrilling plays of the game, when Matthew Stafford connected with Puka Nacua for 51 yards. Rather than go for it on fourth-and-2, the Rams opted for a 27 yard field goal to make it 9-6. Things got worse for the Niners when Brock Purdy's deep throw to the end zone was picked off by Darious Williams. L.A. turned the turnover into three more points, extending their lead to 12-6, where the scoreboard would stay. The Niners, who just last season were in the Super Bowl, have slid significantly and will likely miss the playoffs this season. Let's take a look at what went down in San Francisco on Thursday night. Maybe the Rams didn't put up 457 total yards and 44 points like on Sunday, but without a doubt Stafford's unit was the better offense on Thursday night. Sure, L.A. went 0-2 in the red zone, but on a night where points came at a premium, that didn't matter as much. This was the first game of the year that featured zero touchdowns! The Rams offense finally got into a rhythm late in the third quarter, when Stafford engineered a 17-play, 65-yard drive that ended with three points. Following a three-and-out from San Francisco, Stafford hit Nacua on a 51-yard bomb to set up another field goal for the Rams to acquire their first lead of the game. The Rams recorded just 89 total yards in the first half, and finished with 302 yards of total offense. Usually when you hold your opponent to zero touchdowns, it's good enough for a win. But not in this NFC West showdown. Yes, the 49ers offense was bad, as the 191 yards of total offense was the second-lowest number ever recorded in the Kyle Shanahan era, but the reason the 49ers lost on Thursday was because of their second-half performance. Not only did the defense allow three straight field goal drives in a low-scoring game, but the offense managed just three points of their own with a turnover. San Francisco recorded just 83 yards of total offense in the final two quarters! There were several times during this game where the 49ers needed to make a play, and they just could not. The 49ers are the first team to lose four divisional games while holding a fourth-quarter lead since the 2008 Detroit Lions, who went 0-16. On Thursday, Purdy posted the third-lowest passer rating in his young career as a starter (45.4), and his second-lowest completion percentage (45.2%). After the Rams acquired a 9-6 lead, it was time for some deep shots with the rain out of the area. Unfortunately, Purdy went a little too deep on this shot to Jauan Jennings down the right sideline, and it was picked off by Williams. Following this play, the Rams ran out most of the clock and added three more points for the win. You had to be creative when it came to making catches in the wet weather, and that's what Nacua did in the first quarter. He made a catch while using Charvarius Ward's helmet to secure the football. A new kind of \"helmet catch.\" Samuel posted on social media Monday that he wasn't struggling this season, he just wasn't getting the ball! Shanahan tried to get him the ball on the first play from scrimmage off a slant, but the pass fell incomplete. Later in the first quarter, Samuel got in the way of running back Isaac Guerendo, which caused him to stumble. To make matters worse, Samuel then had a crucial drop on third-and-10 in the third quarter that would have put the 49ers in the red zone for the first time all night. The noise surrounding Samuel will be amplified following this performance. The Rams will head to MetLife Stadium next Sunday to face the New York Jets, who currently sit at 3-10. The 49ers are also taking on an AFC East opponent next week, flying to Miami to face the Dolphins. The Dolphins are currently second in the division at 6-7, behind the 10-3 Buffalo Bills.

Rams win 12-6 in a sloppy affair. Deebo Samuel draws a horse collar penalty on the kick return. 49ers get the ball at the 50-yard line with 11 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. That may be game. The Rams went 69 yards on 13 plays with a mission to end the contest, and Karty was good from 29 yards out. The Rams have now ended their last three drives with field goals, which was the difference in this one. Brock Purdy will have 18 seconds with zero timeouts to make something happen. LAR 12 SF 6 Rams offense playing super motivated on this drive -- trying to put the game away. L.A. has quickly picked up 42 yards on six plays, and the Rams are into enemy territory with three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. I said we were starting to see some deep shots here in the fourth quarter, but Purdy went TOO deep while trying to find Jauan Jennings down the field. It's picked off by Darious Williams 31 yards down the field! Touchback. This could be a turning point in the game. We are starting to see some downfield shots now that the rain has subsided. That's good for Brock Purdy and the 49ers. Sean McVay hates failing in the red zone, but he probably hates it less on a night like this where points are at a premium. The Rams go 58 yards on five plays (thanks to a 51-yard catch from Puka), and Karty is called on to kick a 27-yard field goal on fourth-and-2 at the 49ers' 8-yard line. LAR 9 SF 69:28 remaining in the fourth quarter Now we have some action! Matthew Stafford dropped back on first down and found Nacua wide open 51 yards down the field! Rams right back in the red zone. San Francisco couldn't respond after Karty tied the game with his short FG. A George Kittle OPI penalty pushed the 49ers back 10 yards on first down, and the 20 yards were too much to overcome for the SF offense. Guerendo had a nice pickup of 16 yards on third-and-20, but Shanahan wasn't going to keep his offense on the field at his own 26-yard line. L.A. finally moved the ball on offense, going 65 yards on 16 plays, but the drive stalls at the 49ers' 12-yard line. Credit to the 49ers red zone defense, which has NOT been good this year. Karty is good from 23 yards out, and we are tied. LAR 6 SF 613:38 remaining in the fourth quarter For the first time tonight, a team has reached the red zone. The Rams are in the midst of their best drive of the game, having picked up over 50 yards on this possession. The Rams didn't get to the 49ers' 37-yard line just to kick a field goal. Sean McVay keeps his offense on the field on fourth-and-1, and Stafford pushes up the middle for two yards. Stafford's Over/Under for rushing yards was 0.5. He has 13 rushing yards now. Deebo Samuel with an absolutely HORRIFIC drop on third-and-10. It would have been a first down. Instead Jake Moody comes on to hit a 47-yard field goal. 49ers retake the lead after going 34 yards on nine plays. SF 6 LAR 38:23 remaining in the third quarter 49ers have already picked up three first downs on their first possession of the third quarter. They are in field goal range. The Rams offense didn't improve after the halftime break, as Stafford's unit went three-and-out to begin the third quarter. Kyren Williams picked up five yards on two straight carries, but Stafford just threw the ball away on third-and-5. Rolling right, he decided not to take a chance for one of his receivers. Was a little puzzling, but nothing was open downfield. 6 points, 11 punts, 9 first downs, 0 TD, 0 turnovers First downs: LAR 4 SF 5Third downs: LAR 2-8 SF 2-9Total yards: LAR 89 SF 108TOP: LAR 15:35 SF 14:25Punts: LAR 5 SF 6 Matthew Stafford 4/12 23 yardsBrock Purdy 9/19 96 yards Kyren Williams 14 rushes 44 yardsIsaac Guerendo 8 rushes 17 yardsDeebo Samuel 2 rushes 3 yards Puka Nacua 3 catches 19 yardsKyren Williams 1 catch 4 yardsGeorge Kittle 2 catches 43 yardsJauan Jennings 2 catches 31 yardsDeebo Samuel 3 catches 16 yards Kobie Turner 6 total tackles, 2 sacksDre Greenlaw (first game this year) 9 total tackles 49ers go three-and-out, picking up six yards on three plays. There's 29 seconds remaining in the second quarter, so I'm not sure Stafford and Co. can get anything going at their own 22-yard line. The 49ers have three timeouts, and are going fast trying to get down the field into scoring position. Rams get the ball to start the second half. The Rams are finally on the board thanks to the right leg of Joshua Karty. He's good from 48 yards out -- successfully capping a 20-yard, seven-play drive for the Rams. Both teams are now 2-8 on third downs. LAR 3 SF 31:05 remaining in the second quarter Kobie Turner's second sack of the game ends the 49ers drive. He's been a monster in this one: 5 tackles and 2 sacks. Rams have great field position at the 50-yard line with just over four minutes remaining in the first half. A 10-yard completion to Kittle moves the chains for the 49ers on third-and-8. Kittle has two catches for 43 yards. Something to note: Matthew Stafford has been high on multiple throws so far. The rain may be playing a role in that. 49ers star linebacker Fred Warner has returned to the game after exiting earlier in the opening quarter From CBS Sports Research: The Rams had zero first downs in their first four drives for the first time since 2013 The 49ers converted the first third down of the game thanks to an 18-yard Jauan Jennings catch on a third-and-9, but the 20-yard, six-play drive came to an end at midfield for San Francisco.

                "title": "The Game Awards 2024: All the biggest announcements | Mashable",
                "content": "The 2024 Game Awards took place in Los Angeles' Peacock Theater on Thursday night, with developers travelling from across the globe to celebrate this year in video games. Now in its 10th year, The Game Awards have become known for new game announcements and previews as much as they are for celebrity appearances, weird marketing stunts, and forcing timid game developers to awkwardly deliver speeches in front of thousands of people. Here are all the biggest announcements from The Game Awards 2024. The 2024 Game Awards started out strong with the announcement of The Witcher IV from CD Projeckt Red. The fourth game in the Witcher series, The Witcher IV will break from its predecessors by following former supporting character Ciri rather than previous protagonist Geralt — and it looks as though she's shaping up to be just as formidable a monster slayer as he is. The Witcher IV will be a single-player open-world roleplaying game though, with CD Project Red stating that it \"marks the beginning of a new saga with Ciri as a protagonist.\" This project is the studio's first new game since 2020's Cyberpunk 2077, and the first new title in the Witcher series since The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2015. Considering how popular FromSoftware's Elden Ring was in 2022, it's unsurprising that we're getting more games in the same universe. What is surprising is that Elden Ring: Nightreign will be a three-person co-op action survival game, and is a spin-off rather than a sequel. Fortunately it will also support singleplayer, so you won't always need to wait for your friends to play. Elden Ring: Nightreign will have players work together to survive the \"everchanging\" land of Limveld and level up one of eight characters, each of whom have their own special abilities. Survive for three days, and you'll have to face the dangerous Nightlords. Though the game will have many of the same weapons and enemies found in Elden Ring, the world will be different in every playthrough. New key locations, enemies, and weapons will appear or shift around in each new game, FromSoftware stating that players will have to overcome \"the map itself.\" Elden Ring: Nightreign is currently planned for release on PlayStation 4/5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC in 2025. We don't even know the title of this game, but its pedigree already makes it one that many people will want to keep an eye on. The Game Awards offered a brief glimpse at a new game from genDESIGN and its founder Fumito Ueda, the creator behind notable titles such as Ico, Shadow of the Colossus, and The Last Guardian. Borderlands 4 was previously announced with a teaser trailer in August, but now we have our official first look at 2K Games' next entry in the popular franchise. The new first-person loot shooter will pick up after the events of Borderlands 3, when — spoiler alert — Siren Lilith averted a disastrous collision by teleporting Pandora's moon Elpis to an unknown location. It turns out that said location was the atmosphere above Kairos, which did not do great things for the protective barrier surrounding the planet. Borderlands 4 positions players as a Vault Hunter searching for treasure, wealth, and glory after crash landing on Kairos several years later. It may not all be hedonistic self-interest though. Players will contend with The Timekeeper, Kairos' ruthless dictator and leader of an army of synthetic soldiers known as The Order. Also opposing him are the Rippers led by their formidable Queen Callis, making the situation on Kairos volatile to say the least. The game will support solo players as well as co-op games, with two-player local split screen or up to four players online. Borderlands 4 is scheduled to arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2025. Virtua Fighter is a hugely influential fighting game series. Considered the first ever 3D fighting game, the game has informed and inspired numerous others since its first title was released in 1993. Even so, there hasn't been a new Virtua Fighter game since Virtua Fighter 5 in 2007. This is about to change. SEGA announced a new Virtua Fighter game during Thursday's Game Awards, this time led by Like a Dragon/Yakuza developer Ryu Ga Gotoku. In a subsequent livestream, SEGA President and COO Shuji Utsumi revealed that the original Virtua Fighter team has also returned to work on the game for the first time since 2006. \"For a number of years now, we have been working on this project together with the Virtua Fighter developers as a united team,\" said Ryu Ga Gotoku director Masayoshi Yokoyama (translated from Japanese to English). \"[It will] incorporate the game technologies that Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has built and refined over the years, as well as Virtua Fighter's signature full-contact action systems.\" The Game Awards traditionally end with \"just one more thing,\" a big, exciting reveal to close out the night. This year that reveal was a brand new game in a brand new IP from The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog, offering a cool '80s retro sci-fi aesthetic. Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet follows bounty hunter Jordan A. Mun (Tati Gabrielle), who pursues her latest target to the mysterious planet of Sempiria. Nobody has left Sempiria's orbit in over 600 years, with all communication from it having gone dark. Now Jordan must keep her wits about her and fight hard if she wants to be the first person in six centuries to escape. The sci-fi adventure game will be scored by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who have previously provided the soundtracks for films such as The Social Network, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl, and Challengers. We don't know much else about Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet yet. However, Naughty Dog Studio Head Neil Druckmann states that it \"lives up to the Naughty Dog tradition of creating an emotional, character-driven epic journey,\" and that it will be \"the deepest gameplay in Naughty Dog’s history.\" For many gamers, The Game Awards' main appeal is its slew of new game reveals. Even so, the event is technically an awards ceremony, with one game ultimately taking home the title of Game of the Year. The 2024 Game Awards' Game of the Year went to platformer Astro Bot, developed by Team Asobi. Though Astro Bot and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth led the nominations with seven each, the former took home the most trophies after winning Best Game Direction, Best Action/Adventure Game, and Best Family Game as well.

                "title": "LeBron James - Wikipedia",
                "content": "LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/;[1] lə-BRON; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"King James\", he is widely recognized as one of the best players in the sport's history and is often compared with Michael Jordan in debates on the greatest basketball player of all time.[a] James has won four NBA championships from 10 NBA Finals appearances, having made eight consecutive appearances between 2011 and 2018.[2] He also won the inaugural NBA Cup in 2023 with the Lakers and three Olympic gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team and won the Olympics MVP in the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition to being the NBA's all-time leading scorer and ranking fourth in NBA career assists and eighth in NBA career steals, James holds several individual honors: four NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, four NBA Finals MVP Awards, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, three NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards, and the inaugural NBA Cup MVP award. He has been named an NBA All-Star a record 20 times, selected to the All-NBA Team a record 20 times (including a record 13 First Team selections)[3][4] and the All-Defensive Team six times (including five First Team selections), and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in his career.[5][6] The oldest active player in the NBA, he is tied with Vince Carter for the record for the most seasons played in league history, with 22. James grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities.[7] A prep-to-pro, James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year,[8] he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010.[5] James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat;[9] this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history. James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he additionally earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse and won his third Finals MVP.[10] In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP.[11] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the leading scorer in league history, and the following year, he became part of the first father-son teammate duo in NBA history, playing alongside his son Bronny with the Lakers. Off the court, James has earned further wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.[12] James has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2013, 2017, and 2019 – the most selections for a professional athlete. James has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). He has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron, Ohio.[13][14] James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was only 16 at the time of his birth.[15]: 22 His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.[16][17][18] When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[19] Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[15]: 23 James began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.[20] He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[19] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[15]: 24 The group dubbed themselves the \"Fab Four\" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.[15]: 27 In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.[21] As a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 18 points and 6.2 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team.[22] The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.[23] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.3 points and 7.4 rebounds, along with 5.5 assists and 3.7 steals per game.[24] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[25] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions.[22] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[22] In 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in Slam magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), as \"[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now\".[26] During the season, James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[15]: 104 With averages of 28 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[22] and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[15]: 117 St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[15]: 114 Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.[27][28] During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[29] Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[15]: 142 Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to Ohio-based subscribers for $7.95 per game on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season, but ended up not being profitable.[15]: 143 [30] For the year, James averaged 30.4 points, 9.7 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 2.9 steals per game,[22] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[15]: 178 and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[22] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[31] Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, James skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player.[32] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[31] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[31] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[33] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[34] St. Vincent–St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.[35] As an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent–St. Mary's football team.[15]: 51 He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[36] At the end of his second year, James was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[24] James did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game.[37] Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, as well as former and current professional players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League (NFL).[b] James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[42] In his first regular season game, James scored 25 points in a 106–92 loss to the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[43] At the conclusion of the 2003–2004 season, James became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[8] With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game,[44] he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, five rebounds, and five assists per game as a rookie.[45] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[46] In the 2004–2005 season, James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[47] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told Sports Illustrated: \"It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule.\"[48] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[49] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.[24] Despite a 30–20 record to start the year,[49] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.[50] At the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[51] Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game,[5] he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash.[52] Under James' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998.[53] In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort over the Washington Wizards.[54] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, and made another in Game 5.[55] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.[56] In the 2006–2007 season, James finished the regular season averaging 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[24] With a starting five featuring James, Larry Hughes, Drew Gooden, Aleksandar Pavlović, and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the #2-seed in the Eastern Conference.[59] In the first two rounds of the playoffs, LeBron led the team to wins over the Washington Wizards and New Jersey Nets. The Cavaliers then faced the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals, he logged 48 points with nine rebounds and seven assists. His performance is considered one of the greatest playoff performances of all time as he scored 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including 25 straight, and the game-winning layup with two seconds left. The Cavaliers won 109–107 double-overtime victory over the Detroit Pistons.[60] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \"Jordan-esque\".[61] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[62] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.[63] The Spurs at the time were coached by Gregg Popovich and featured a prime Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Bruce Bowen. With no other significant scoring threats, the Spurs built its defense around stopping James from getting into the paint. As James did not have a reliable jump shot yet nor another offensive weapon on his team, he struggled against the Spurs' zone defense.[64] He averaged 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting,[65] as Cleveland was eliminated in a four-game sweep.[66] In February of the 2007–2008 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, eight-rebound, and nine-assist performance.[67] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Toronto Raptors, doing so in over 100 fewer games than Daugherty.[68] James' 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title.[69] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45–37.[70] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[71] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a \"shootout\".[72] At the end of the 2008–2009 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team,[73] posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks.[74] James also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season.[75] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66–16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history.[76] With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.[77] Reflecting on James' performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote: \"He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it.\"[78] In the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals.[79] In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers.[62] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1–1.[80] Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike.[81][82] For the series, James averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8.0 assists per game,[83] finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.[5] In February of the 2009–10 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to players in the Cavaliers' backcourt.[84] Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season.[85] Despite only playing 39 minutes per game, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.0 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award.[86] To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Chicago Bulls to earn a matchup with the Boston Celtics in the second round.[87] James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points.[88] The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd.[89] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists in the losing effort.[87] James became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 a.m. EDT on July 1, 2010.[91] During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[92] On July 8, James announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat.[93] The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities.[94] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami;[95] reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies.[96] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; James thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[97] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[98] James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.[97] Upon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James' choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[99] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James' actions.[100] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[101] Former NBA players, including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for forming a superteam with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship in Cleveland, though Jordan did acknowledge that the options players had at the time were much more expansive than those he and others had in the 1980s and 1990s.[102][103][104] Some commentators did defend James' decision to join the Miami Heat by noting the Cavaliers' inability to build a strong supporting cast around him. They argued that other NBA greats had benefitted from talented teammates: Magic Johnson had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy, Larry Bird had Kevin McHale (basketball) and Robert Parish on the Celtics, and Michael Jordan had Scottie Pippen with the Bulls.[105] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision.[106][107] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, James quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, which marked a radical change from prior years.[108][109] The phrase \"taking my talents to South Beach\" became a punch line for critics.[110][111] In retrospect, James has expressed some regret over his handling of The Decision.[109][112][113] James officially signed a 6-year, $110 million contract with the Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal which sent two second- and two first-round draft picks to the Cavaliers and gave the team the option to swap first round picks with the Heat in 2012.[114][115] As part of the first player-created NBA superteam[116] he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.[117] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new \"Big Three\" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.[118] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships.[119][120] Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.[121] Throughout the 2010–11 season, the media and opposing fanbases treated James and the Heat as villains.[122] To begin the year, they struggled to adjust to these new circumstances, going only 9–8 after 17 games.[123] James later admitted that the constant negativity surrounding the team made him play with an angrier demeanor than in years past.[122] On December 2, James faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent.[124] He scored 38 points and led Miami to a victory while being booed every time he touched the ball.[125] The Heat eventually turned their season around and finished as the East's second seed,[126] with James averaging 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7.0 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.[5] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with the Boston Celtics for the second consecutive year.[127] In Game 5, he scored Miami's last 10 points to help seal a series-clinching win.[128] After the final buzzer, James famously knelt on the court in an emotional moment, later telling reporters that it was an extremely personal victory for him and the team.[129] The Heat eventually advanced to the Finals, where they lost to the Dallas Mavericks in six games.[127] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series and scored just eight points in Game 4, a game Miami lost by just three points.[130] His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.[131] The 2011–2012 season was delayed by a lockout, and during that extended summer, James worked with Hakeem Olajuwon in order to improve his post up game.[132][123][133] Humbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, the experience inspired James to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped James regain a sense of joy on the court.[122] Behind his expanded skillset,[133] Miami began the year with a franchise-best 18–6 record.[134] James was eventually named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.[135] In the second round of the playoffs, Miami temporarily lost Bosh to an abdominal injury and found themselves trailing the Indiana Pacers 2–1.[137] James responded with a 40-point, 18-rebound, and nine-assist outing in Game 4 to help even the series.[138] To compensate for Bosh's absence, the Heat embraced a small-ball lineup with James at power forward, which they retained even after Bosh's return in the conference finals against the Boston Celtics.[139][140] Facing elimination in Game 6, James recorded 45 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Heat to victory in what The New York Times called a \"career-defining performance\".[141] Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder and James' budding rival Kevin Durant.[142] Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps.[143] In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James' first championship.[144] James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[145] His full postseason run, in which James averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN.[146] In February of the 2012–13 season, James averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records.[147][148] That same month, the Heat also began a 27-game winning streak, which is the third longest in NBA history.[149] Based on these accomplishments, James' performance was described as a \"month for the ages\" by Sports Illustrated.[150] Miami eventually finished the year with a franchise and league best 66–16 record,[151] and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.[152] His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.[5] In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers.[153] Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted James to compare his responsibilities to those of his \"Cleveland days\".[154] Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the San Antonio Spurs,[155] signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier.[156] At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2–3.[83][155][157] In Game 6, James recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory.[158] In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points.[159] James was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7.0 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.[160] On March 3 of the 2013–14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats.[161] He converted on his first eight three-point field goal attempts through three quarters, setting a new record for the most three-point field goals made in a 60-point game. James also set the record for most points in a single game while wearing a mask. Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries,[162] finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting.[5] In the second round of the playoffs, James tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets.[163] In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so.[164] In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the San Antonio Spurs take an early series lead.[165] In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate.[166] San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat.[167] For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game.[168] On June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, and on July 1, he officially became an unrestricted free agent.[169] On July 11, James revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the Cavaliers.[170] In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received.[171][172][173] The next day, James officially signed with the team,[174] who had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his departure.[175] A month after James' signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.[176] In January of the 2014–2015 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, which at the time represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[179] In total, James played a then career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[5] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Chicago Bulls.[180] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Atlanta Hawks to advance to the NBA Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[181] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[181] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before losing in six games.[182] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[183] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game.[182] During the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' coach David Blatt.[184][185] Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East.[186] James' final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting.[5] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the NBA Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Golden State Warriors,[186] who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season.[187] To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses.[188] James responded by registering back-to-back 41-point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[189] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a chasedown block on Andre Iguodala's go-ahead layup attempt,[190] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals.[10] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[191] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[188] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.[192] The 2016–17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers;[193] James later described it as one of the \"strangest\" years of his career.[194] Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, James publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too \"top heavy\", for which he received countercriticism.[195] The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game.[5] In Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Indiana Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history.[196] In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader.[197] The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to the NBA Finals for the third consecutive time against the Golden State Warriors, who had signed James' rival Kevin Durant during the off-season.[198] Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12.0 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.[199] Prior to the start of the 2017–18 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James.[200] After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December.[201] Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards on November 3 where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record.[202] In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort.[203] The next month, James won his third All-Star Game MVP Award, after posting 29 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, and several key plays to help Team LeBron win over Team Curry.[204] Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits.[205] James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, and 4.2 turnovers per game.[5] In the playoffs, James guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Golden State Warriors.[206] Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors, after which a new nickname, \"LeBronto\" was popularized.[207][208] In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland lost 124–114 in overtime.[209] Following the loss, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series.[210] The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game for the Finals.[211] On June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent.[212] Two days later, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers;[213] the deal was officially completed on July 9.[214] In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James's agent Rich Paul explained: \"In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do.\"[215] Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.[216] The Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010.[217][218] Following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. To begin the 2018–19 season, the Lakers struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games.[219] In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James's strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers.[220] Four days later, James scored a season-high 51 points in a victory over the Heat.[221] After blowing out the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20–14, but James suffered a groin injury,[222] the first major injury of his career.[223] James missed a then career-high 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him,[222] marking the first time that James missed the playoffs since 2005.[224] In March, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction,[225] and he was later officially ruled out for the rest of the season.[226] James' final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game.[5] Despite his inconsistent campaign, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team.[227] \"Kobe is a brother to me. From the time I was in high school watching him from afar, to getting in this league at 18 and watching him up close, all the battles that we had throughout my career, the one thing that we always shared was that determination to just want to win, to just want to be great. The fact that I'm here now means so much to me. I want to continue, along with my teammates, his legacy. Not only for this year, but for as long as we can play this game of basketball that we love, because that's what Kobe Bryant would want. So in the words of Kobe Bryant, 'Mamba out'. But in the words of us, 'not forgotten' Live on, brother.\" During the offseason, the Lakers hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach, and traded the majority of their young core to the Pelicans for superstar big man Anthony Davis.[229] James immediately embraced the team's much-improved roster by transforming his playing style, moving to full-time point guard, and competing with a more consistent defensive effort.[230] Behind James' leadership, the Lakers opened the 2019–20 season with a 17–2 record, matching the best start in franchise history.[231] On January 25, James scored his 33,644th career point, passing Kobe Bryant for third on the all-time regular season scoring list.[232] The following day, Bryant died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.[233] James delivered an improvised eulogy in honor of Bryant at Staples Center, before a January 31 game against the Portland Trail Blazers.[234] In early March, before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, James led the Lakers to a victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in a matchup of conference leaders, followed by a streak-breaking victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.[235] Regular season play resumed in July and concluded in August within the confined NBA Bubble, where James ended the regular season as the league leader in assists for the first time in his career, averaging 10.2 assists per game.[236] He earned a record 16th All-NBA Team selection as part of the First Team, extending his record First Team selections to 13.[237] The Lakers entered the playoffs as the top seed in the West and advanced to the NBA Finals convincingly, with only three total losses along the way.[238] In Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals against the Denver Nuggets, James helped clinch the conference championship by scoring a game-high 38 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter.[239] In the Finals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with his former team, the Miami Heat, and quickly took control of the series with a 2–0 lead.[240] In Game 5, James had his best statistical performance of the Finals with 40 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a memorable duel with Miami's Jimmy Butler, but Los Angeles was ultimately defeated in a three-point game.[241] The Lakers eliminated the Heat in Game 6, which earned James, who averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game during the series,[242] his fourth NBA championship and fourth Finals MVP award.[11] At 35 years and 287 days old, James became the second-oldest player in league history to win the award,[243] and the only player in NBA history to win the award with three different franchises.[244] James and teammate Danny Green also became the third and fourth players in NBA history to win at least one championship with three different teams each.[245] The 2020–2021 season, reduced to 72 games for each team and starting on December 22, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, began after the shortest offseason in NBA history with a 116–109 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[246] On December 31, James became the first player in NBA history to score 10 points or more in 1,000 consecutive games in a 121–107 victory over the San Antonio Spurs.[247] On February 18, 2021, James became the third player in NBA history with 35,000 career points, joining Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone; aged 36 years and 50 days, he was the youngest player to reach the milestone.[248] On March 20, James sprained his ankle against the Atlanta Hawks,[249] but was able to hit a three-point shot afterwards to keep his 10-points streak alive before exiting the game.[250] By March, the Lakers were No. 2, two games behind the Utah Jazz, but they went 14–16 without Davis and 6–10 without James, falling to No. 5.[251] James returned on April 30 after missing 20 games, the longest absence of his career.[252] In May, James was sidelined again after leaving a game against the Toronto Raptors,[253] but he returned for the final two games,[254][255] and finished the season with averages of 25.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.8 assists on 51.3 percent shooting in 45 out of 72 games;[256] this was his 17th consecutive season averaging at least 25 points per game, the most in NBA history.[257] In an injury-laden season, the Lakers ended with a 42–30 record, finishing No. 7 due to tiebreakers and facing the No. 8-seed Warriors in the play-in tournament.[258] The Lakers won 103–100 after James scored the go-ahead, three-point shot in the final minute, posting a triple-double with 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, along with two steals and a block.[259] His 34-foot (10 m) shot over Stephen Curry before the shot clock buzzer was his longest basket of the season as well as his longest go-ahead shot in the closing three minutes of a game in his career.[260][261] In the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers faced the No. 2 Phoenix Suns. This marked the first time in James' career that he did not have home court advantage in the opening series.[262][263] They were up 2–1 before Davis suffered a strained groin in Game 4, in which James finished with a game-high 25 points on 10-for-21 shooting, 12 rebounds, and 6 assists.[264] The Lakers lost to the Suns in six games, marking the first time James lost in the first round in his career.[262] James finished the series averaging 23.3 points, his fourth-lowest scoring output for a series over his career and his lowest mark since averaging 22.8 in the 2014 Eastern Conference finals.[265] He made his 17th consecutive All-NBA Team selection,[3] extending the record for most selections in NBA history,[266] being named for the third time to the All-NBA Second Team.[267] For the 2021–22 season, James was joined by Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook.[268] In a game against the Pistons on November 21, James was ejected in the third quarter after getting into a scuffle with Isaiah Stewart during the 121–116 victory. This was the second time in his career that he was ejected from a game,[269] and James was suspended for one game due to his actions.[270] In his next 16 games, James averaged 30.4 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.4 blocks on 54 percent shooting, also achieving his 100th triple-double,[271] while becoming the third player in NBA history to surpass 36,000 career points;[272] during this period, James played 35 percent of his minutes at center.[273][274] From December 19 to February 26, 2022, playing 23 out of 27 games, he had a streak of 23 consecutive 25-point games.[275] In December, James became the second player in NBA history (after Michael Jordan) to post 40 points and no turnovers at age 35 or older.[276] In January, James met the minimum criteria for points per game by playing at least 70 percent of his team's games, averaging 28.6 points, and became the oldest player to average 25+ points per game, having already been the youngest to do so, as James averaged 27.6 points per game in his sophomore season at 20 years old.[277] He also became the oldest player in NBA history to record at least 25 points in ten straight games, doing so at 37 years old.[278] By January 20, James became the fifth player in NBA history to record at least 30,000 career points and 10,000 career rebounds; he is the first player to record at least 30,000 career points, 10,000 career rebounds, and 9,000 career assists.[279][280][281] In the same period, he surpassed Oscar Robertson for 4th all-time free throws made,[282] and Alvin Robertson for 10th all-time in career steals.[283][284] In February, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most points scored in both the regular season and playoffs;[285] by March, he passed Karl Malone for second in the all-time minutes and regular season scoring lists.[286][287][288] At the 2022 NBA All-Star Game held in Cleveland, James was celebrated among the other 74 players for the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[289] James led all players in fan votes with his 18th All-Star selection, tying Bryant and just one behind Abdul-Jabbar;[290] his team achieved its fifth consecutive All-Star victory,[291] defeating Team Durant 163–161,[292] with James hitting the game-winning dagger shot in front of his hometown crowd.[293][294] In March, James recorded two 50-point games, which were also his Lakers' career-high,[295][296] becoming the oldest player to have multiple 50-point games in a season, as well as the first Lakers player since Bryant in 2008 to have back-to-back 50-point home games; it was James' 15th 50-point game in his 19-year career, including the postseason.[297] He also recorded his 10,000th career assist, becoming the only player in NBA history to record at least 10,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists.[298][299] On March 27, James became just the second player in NBA history to score 37,000 points.[300] Due to an ankle injury in late March, he missed out on a close three-players run for the NBA scoring title,[301][302][303] having only played 56 games, two less than the necessary to qualify;[304] aged 37, James would have broken Jordan's record of oldest scoring leader at 34.[305] For The Athletic, Bill Oram wrote that James' ankle injury felt like \"the moment that might signal the end of the Lakers season\".[306][307] On April 5, the Lakers were eliminated from both playoff and play-in contention for the first time since 2019 (James's first season with the Lakers) after a 121–110 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[308] It marked the fourth time in James' career that he missed the playoffs.[309] James was ruled out the rest of the season due to soreness in his left ankle.[310] He finished the season with a 7.6 box plus–minus (first among players in his age group) and averages of 30.3 points (first by 6.9 points among players in his age range), 8.2 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 2.9 threes, 1.3 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game on 52–35–75 shooting ranges.[311] On May 24, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the second time; it was his 18th consecutive All-NBA Team selection, extending the record for most selections in NBA history.[312] On August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Lakers on a two-year, $97.1 million contract.[313][314] The contract extension made him the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9 million, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings.[315] On October 20, James made his 2,144th three-pointer in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers, surpassing Paul Pierce for tenth in all-time three-pointers made.[316] On October 28, James posted 28 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and four steals in an 111–102 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

During the ceremony, he received the game ball from Abdul-Jabbar.[333] James also gave a speech and then embraced Abdul-Jabbar, as well as his family.[334][335] James missed the following three games due to left ankle soreness.[336][337] On February 19, Team LeBron lost the 2023 NBA All-Star Game 184–175 to Team Giannis, marking the first time that James lost an All-Star game as a captain.[c] Prior to the game, he had been undefeated (5–0) as a captain, and since the format was changed in 2018.[339] During the game, James suffered a right hand contusion and was ruled out for the entire 2nd half.[340] On February 26, James sustained a right foot injury during a game against the Dallas Mavericks. Despite the injury, he was able to finish the game and helped the Lakers pull off the biggest comeback victory of the season at the time after trailing by 27 points late in the first half. He scored 26 points on 10-for-23 shooting, eight rebounds, and three assists in 37 minutes.[341] However, following an examination by team medical staff on March 2, James was diagnosed with a tendon injury in his right foot and would be reevaluated in three weeks.[342] After missing the next 13 games, James made his return on March 26 against the Chicago Bulls. He came off the bench for just the second time in his career; the other being in 2007.[343][344] On April 2, James put up a triple-double with 18 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 134–109 victory over the Houston Rockets. He also tied Jason Kidd for fourth place on the all-time career triple-doubles list.[345] Two days later, James put up 37 points, five rebounds, six assists, a steal, a block, and a game-winning layup in a 135–133 overtime victory over the Utah Jazz.[346] On April 9, in the final game of the 2022–23 season, James posted 36 points, six rebounds, and six assists to lead the Lakers to a 128–117 victory over the Jazz, earning the seventh seed in the Western Conference play-in tournament.[347] James finished the regular season with averages of 28.9 points per game, 8.3 rebounds per game, 6.8 assists per game, becoming the oldest player in NBA history to average at least 25 points, five rebounds, and five assists in a season.[348] In Game 4 of the Lakers' first-round series against the Memphis Grizzlies, James had 22 points, a playoff career-high 20 rebounds, and seven assists in a 117–111 overtime victory, marking his first 20–20 game of his career.[349] He became the first Lakers player with a 20–20 game in the postseason since Shaquille O'Neal in Game 4 of the 2004 NBA Finals and also the oldest player in league history with at least 20 points and 20 rebounds in a playoff game.[350] In Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals, James put up 30 points, nine rebounds, nine assists, two steals, and a block in a 122–101 victory over the defending champion Golden State Warriors to lead the Lakers to the 2023 Western Conference finals, their second Conference finals appearance in five seasons. He also won his 41st playoff series, surpassing Derek Fisher for the most all-time playoff series wins in NBA history.[351][352] In the Western Conference finals, the Lakers were swept by the eventual NBA champion Denver Nuggets, despite James' 40-point, 10-rebound and 9-assist outing in the 113–111 closeout loss in Game 4.[353] He also set his personal playoff record with 31 points in the first half.[354] Entering the 2023–24 season, James was the oldest player in the league, following the retirements of Udonis Haslem and Andre Iguodala.[355] In the season opener against the defending champion Nuggets, James put up 21 points, eight rebounds and five assists in a 119–107 loss.[356] On November 1, James put up 35 points in a 130–125 overtime victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. His 35 points were his 81st 30-point game since turning 35, surpassing Karl Malone for the most 30-point games by any player since turning 35 in NBA history.[357] On November 15, James logged 28 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists in a 125–110 loss to the Sacramento Kings, becoming the second-oldest player to have recorded a triple-double. He also moved up to the fifth and eighth places (passing Jason Kidd and Jason Terry, respectively) in the all-time triple-doubles and three-pointers lists, respectively.[358][359][360] Four days later, James scored a season-high 37 points in a narrow 105–104 win over the Houston Rockets. He also tied Vince Carter for seventh on the all-time three-pointers made list with 2,290, and moved past Clyde Drexler for eighth on the all-time steals list at 2,208.[361] On November 21, in a 131–99 blowout victory over the Utah Jazz, he became the first player in league history to reach 39,000 career points.[362] James also broke a tie with Vince Carter, and moved to seventh place in the league's all-time three-pointers made list.[363] Six days later, in a 138–94 blowout loss to the Philadelphia 76ers, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record of 66,300 minutes to become the player with the most minutes played in NBA games during the regular season and playoffs.[364] The Lakers' 44-point loss was also the worst loss of LeBron's career.[365] On December 9, James and the Lakers won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament with a 123–109 victory over the Pacers, with James receiving the Tournament MVP award and being selected to the All-Tournament team.[366][367] On January 25, 2024, James was named an All-Star starter for the 2024 NBA All-Star Game, marking his 20th NBA All-Star selection, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most All-Star selections in NBA history.[368] Two days later, James put up a triple-double with 36 points, a career-high 20 rebounds, and 12 assists, including a pair of game-winning free throws, in a narrow 145–144 double overtime victory over the Golden State Warriors,[369] becoming the first player in Lakers franchise history since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1976 to put up at least 30 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 assists in a game.[370] On February 28, James spearheaded a 21-point fourth-quarter comeback by the Lakers to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 116–112, marking the largest fourth-quarter comeback of James' career and the Lakers' biggest comeback since 2003.[371] He outscored the Clippers by himself 19–16 in the final quarter, going 5-for-8 from three-point range and dishing out four assists.[372] Three days later, James became the first player in NBA history to reach 40,000 career points.[373] On March 16, he scored a season-high 40 points on 15-of-23 shooting with eight rebounds and nine assists in a 128–121 loss to the Warriors.[374] On March 31, James put up 40 points on a career-high nine three-pointers made along with seven rebounds and five assists in a 116–104 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. He also surpassed Michael Jordan for the most 30-point games (across the regular season and playoffs) in NBA history with 672.[375][376] On April 2, James passed Oscar Schmidt to become the world's all-time scoring leader in basketball history.[377] In the season finale on April 14 against the Pelicans, James scored 28 points, brought down 11 rebounds, and his 17 assists pushed his career total over the 11k mark.[378] James finished his 21st season in the NBA averaging 25.7 points, 8.3 assists and 7.3 rebounds a game. He also shot 54% from the field and a career-high 41.0% from 3-point range, making him the first player to average over 25 points and eight assists while shooting at least 50% overall and 40% from beyond the arc for an entire season.[379] On the road against the Pelicans in the play-in game, James had 23 points, nine rebounds, and nine assists to win 110–106 and clinch his 17th career playoff appearance.[380] After the Lakers fell into a 3–0 series deficit in the first round against the Denver Nuggets, James scored 14 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter in game 4 as the Lakers won 119–108 to stave off elimination.[381] In the process, James recorded his 19th career 30-point game when facing elimination and improved to 15–12 in 27 career elimination games.[382] The Lakers lost the series in five games, despite James's 30-point and 11-rebound outing in a 108–106 closeout loss in Game 5.[383] On July 6, 2024, James re-signed with the Lakers.[384] Two weeks prior, James's son Bronny had been drafted 55th overall by the Lakers. This marked the first father-son duo in NBA history.[385] On October 22, in a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, James and Bronny became the first father-son duo to appear in an NBA game together in NBA history.[386] During his 2024–25 season debut, he tied Vince Carter for the record for the most NBA seasons played.[387] On November 13, he logged a triple-double of 35 points, 12 rebounds, and 14 assists, in a 128–123 victory against the Memphis Grizzlies. At age 39 years and 319 days, he broke his own record previously set in November 2019 for the oldest player to record a triple-double in three consecutive games.[388] Two days later, he recorded his fourth consecutive triple-double of the season with 15 points, 16 rebounds, and 12 assists, in a 120–115 victory against the San Antonio Spurs, breaking his personal record for the most consecutive triple-doubles made. He also tied the Lakers franchise record for the most consecutive triple-doubles made, joining Magic Johnson (1981, 1987) and Russell Westbrook (2021).[389] On December 1, he reached 15,000 career field goals in a 105–104 victory against the Utah Jazz, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the only players to reach said milestone.[390] As a 19-year-old rookie, James made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece.[391] He spent the Games mostly on the bench,[392] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points, and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games.[391] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding active NBA players to their lineup.[393] James felt that his limited playing time was a \"lowlight\" and believed he was not given \"a fair opportunity to play\".[392] At the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain.[394][395] The team finished the tournament with an 8–1 record, winning another bronze medal.[394] James's behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.[396][397] Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice.[396][398] At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier.[399] Team USA went 10–0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.[391] James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: \"I don't think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now.\"[400] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000.[401] In the final game, James' statistics were – 14 points, six rebounds, and three assists against Spain.[402] James did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England.[403] He became the leader of the team, with Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back.[404] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed.[405] During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds, and 12 assists.[d] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game.[407] James contributed 19 points in the victory, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history.[391][407] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.[408] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said: \"[James] is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.\"[409] After a 12-year gap, James rejoined the national team on the 2024 Olympic squad in Paris as Team Captain at 39 years old.[410] Voted by the entire 592-strong U.S. delegation, James was named as one of the two Team USA flag-bearers for the opening ceremony of the games, becoming the first male basketball player to be so honored.[411][412] James led the team in rebounds and assists. He recorded his second Olympic triple double in a comeback win in the semi-final against Serbia with 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.[413] James became the first player in Olympic history with two triple doubles.[414] Team USA went on to win their fifth straight gold medal, defeating France 98–87 in the final game,[415] with James recording 14 points, 6 rebounds and 10 assists. At the conclusion of the tournament with averages of 14.2 points, 6.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists, James was named the FIBA Men's Olympics MVP and was selected to the FIBA Men's Olympics All-Star Five.[416] James became the third male basketball player to win three gold medals at the Olympics. Standing 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg),[417] James has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions,[5] but he has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary.[418] His playing style, which is athletic and versatile,[133] has drawn comparisons to Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.[419][420][421] Through the 2023–24 season, James' career averages are 27.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.7 blocks per game.[5] Throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.[422][423] As an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring.[425] He holds numerous \"youngest to\" distinctions,[426][427] including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points.[428] During his first stint in Cleveland, James was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[133] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball.[429][430] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because James was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.[431] These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets.[432] Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game.[433] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.[434] In Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James' role to a more unconventional one.[133] James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots.[133][435] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense.[436] Behind these improvements, James' overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels.[437] During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \"average\".[438] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[439] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[5][440] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and James briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint.[441] Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[431] For most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team.[442] His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[443] By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention James garners from opposing defenses,[444] he creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists.[445] James executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic.[446] His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[431] Early in his career, James was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games;[447][448] however, as his career progressed, James' clutch performance was viewed more favorably.[449] At the beginning of his NBA career, James was considered a poor defensive player,[450] but he improved steadily through the years. In 2009, James became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot.[74] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[451] Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[452] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[453] Beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines.[454][455] During his second stint in Cleveland, James' defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching.[456] James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \"chill mode\".[457] He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as \"Playoff LeBron\".[458] James left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history.[e] Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[464] As of 2024, James has been named to 20 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the First Team, which are both NBA records.[3] His four MVP awards are matched only by Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span.[465] James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time,[466] and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014.[5] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[73][467] His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships; his 10 Finals appearances are tied for third all-time.[f] Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have countered that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.[469][470][471] On the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history,[g] and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[479] This has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan.[a] In a 2016 interview with Sports Illustrated, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest.[480] In February 2018, The Ringer spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Bill Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead.[481] In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan.[482][483][484] The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan.[483][484] Davis et al. of Business Insider stated: \"The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he's still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan.\"[484] Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordan's status as the greatest basketball player of all time, Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that \"the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim\" and that \"in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse\", Jordan having more titles and an \"unblemished Finals record holds significant weight\".[480] In addition to praising James' on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted his influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of The Washington Post opined that James' move to the Heat in 2010 \"defined a decade of player movement\", and that he \"fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations.\"[485] James' fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors forward Draymond Green, who reflected: \"We've taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... I think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment.\"[486] Multiple current and former NBA players have suggested James' free agency decisions catalyzed the leaguewide trend in \"superteams\" in the 21st century.[487][488][489][490][491] In 2022, James voiced his desire to play into his forties potentially alongside or against his sons Bronny and Bryce.[492] This eventually happened when Bronny was selected by the Lakers 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, making them the first father-son duo in NBA history.[493] James married his high school sweetheart, Savannah James, on September 14, 2013, in San Diego, California.[494] They have three children: sons Bronny and Bryce, and daughter Zhuri.[492][495] Bronny was a standout high school basketball player, being named a McDonald's All-American in 2023, 20 years after James's selection.[496] During his stint with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, where he bought a $9 million three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay.[497] In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-foot (870 m2) East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, for about $21 million.[498] He purchased another home in Brentwood in December 2017 for $23 million.[499] In September 2020, he purchased a third home in Los Angeles, this one in Beverly Hills for $36.75 million.[500] James also owns a 30,000 square foot mansion in Akron, Ohio that he custom built in 2003 on his property and spent $2.1 million on it.[501] James's best friends in the NBA are Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade. The four have been referred to as the \"banana boat crew\". During an excursion to the Bahamas, James rescued Anthony from the water when Anthony was carried away from the boat by the current. During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted: \"He saved my life\". When asked about how much danger Anthony was in prior to the rescue, James responded: \"I don't really know what to say, to be honest. I'm just happy he's still here, obviously.\"[502] James also maintains a friendship with fellow NBA player Draymond Green.[503] James invests heavily in his health, reportedly spending $1.5 million a year to pay for personal chefs, athletic trainers, and physical therapies for recovery. Kyle Korver has described James's fitness as being on \"another level\". However, James' routine is not perfectly clean; he drinks wine every night, believing it to be good for his heart,[504] while Tristan Thompson has stated that James eats desserts with every meal.[505] In January 2009, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic discovered a growth in the right side of James's jaw. Biopsy results showed that James developed a benign jaw tumor, specifically in his parotid gland,[506] which required a five-hour surgery to remove on June 2 after the end of the Cavaliers' run in the 2009 playoffs.[507] James is considered by fellow NBA players, media tabloids, and popular culture to be the \"face of the NBA\", often alongside Warriors superstar Stephen Curry.[508][509] His opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; for example, in 2014, James asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season.[510] On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).[511] Throughout his career, James has been ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes,[h] and has been listed by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[514] During his first stint with the Cavaliers, James was adored by local fans, and Sherwin-Williams displayed a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters.[515] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he sported a Yankees hat when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games against the New York Yankees.[516] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and The Decision, James was listed as one of the most disliked athletes in the United States.[517] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.[518] In 2014, James was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll.[519] He has led the league in jersey sales six times.[520] Memorabilia associated with James is highly sought after; two of James' rookie cards are among the most expensive basketball cards ever sold at auction, and one of those cards also briefly held the record for the most expensive modern-day sports card when it sold for $1.8 million at auction in July 2020.[523] A Mike Trout rookie card broke the record for a modern-day card the following month.[524] All jerseys worn in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game were auctioned by the NBA and NBPA to raise funds for charity; James' jersey sold for $630,000, setting a record for a modern-day sports jersey.[525] In March 2008, James became the first black man, as well as the third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney, to appear on the cover of Vogue, when he posed with Gisele Bündchen.[526] In response, ESPN columnist Jemele Hill considered the cover offensive and \"memorable for the wrong reasons\", describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bündchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his fair-skinned love interest.[521][522] James has maintained close ties to his hometown of Akron, Ohio, which is also where his charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation (LJFF), is based.[527] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon to raise money for various causes.[528] In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021.[529] In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his \"outstanding service and dedication to the community.\"[530] In November 2017, the Akron School Board approved the I Promise School, a public elementary school created in a partnership with the LJFF to help struggling elementary school students stay in school.[531] The school officially opened on July 30, 2018, with James reflecting that it was his most important professional accomplishment.[532] Other noteworthy public and charitable initiatives undertaken by James in Akron include the I Promise Institute at the University of Akron,[533] I Promise Village (housing complex),[534] House Three-Thirty (community center/retail plaza),[535] and I Promise Health Quarters (medical center).[14] James is also an active supporter of various non-profit organizations, including After-School All-Stars, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Children's Defense Fund.[536][537][538] In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit on Muhammad Ali.[539] Throughout his career, James has taken public stances on controversial issues, and has mentioned a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status.[540] Those include the War in Darfur,[541] the killing of Trayvon Martin,[542] the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014,[540] the Michael Brown verdict,[543] the death of Eric Garner,[544] the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests,[545] the shooting of Breonna Taylor,[546] the death of Ma'Khia Bryant,[547] Kyle Rittenhouse,[548] and the ruling of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.[549] On August 27, 2020, James and his Lakers teammates, as well as the Bucks, began boycotting the 2020 NBA playoffs to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake.[550] In response, senior White House advisor Jared Kushner stated that he was planning to reach out to James regarding the boycott. Following a players' committee to discuss the boycott, James and others reached out to former president Barack Obama, who reportedly advised them to continue playing and finish that year's NBA season.[551] During the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, a statement James made about a since-deleted tweet by Daryl Morey,[552] in which Morey expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, became the subject of controversy. James said Morey was \"misinformed\".[553] His statement drew backlash from protesters in the movement.[554][555] In February 2022, political commentator Bill Maher called James hypocritical for not taking a critical stance towards the Chinese government's human rights abuses.[556] James had taken various other stands on issues regarding sports, such as the Kaepernick controversy and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal.[557][558] In October 2023, in response to the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, James voiced his support for Israel on Instagram.[559] His statement drew backlash for its omission of the Palestinians affected by the crisis, including from Palestinian-American leader and activist Omar Suleiman.[560][561][562] In June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee in support of Barack Obama for the 2008 U.S. presidential election.[563] Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the then-called Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama's 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement.[564] The advertisement was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert.[564] In November 2016, James endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[565] Following a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James expressed that \"being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.\"[566] Later on that year, in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, James questioned the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan and said: \"It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? Our youth deserve better!!\"[567] James also called President Donald Trump a \"bum\" after the president rescinded a White House invitation to Stephen Curry.[568] During a 2018 interview with CNN journalist Don Lemon, James then accused Trump of attempting to divide the country with sports, suggesting that \"sports has never been something that divides people it's always been something that brings someone together.\" He declared that he would \"never sit across from him. I'd sit across from Obama though.\"[569][570] In response, Trump tweeted: \"LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do.\"[571] On August 19, 2020, James announced his intentions to support the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign and that of his running-mate Kamala Harris in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[572] James spoke in support of the More Than a Vote movement and encouraged members of the African-American community to vote,[573] saying, \"People in our community have been just lied to for so many years. We have people that have had convictions in the past, that've been told they cannot vote because they got a conviction. That is voter suppression.\"[574] On October 31, 2024, James announced his support for the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.[575] According to Forbes, in May 2023, James became the first active NBA player to become a billionaire.[576] James' biography LeBron was published on April 11, 2023, by Jeff Benedict. The biography is based on three years of research and more than 250 interviews.[577] James has signed numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies that he has done business with are AT&T,[578] Audemars Piguet,[579] Beats by Dre,[580] Blaze Pizza,[581] Coca-Cola,[582] Dunkin' Brands,[583] Intel,[584] Kia,[585] McDonald's,[586] Nike,[582]PepsiCo,[587] State Farm,[588] and Taco Bell.[589] Coming out of high school, James was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas,[590] eventually signing a seven-year deal with Nike in 2003[591] for approximately $90 million.[592] His signature shoes have performed well for Nike.[593] In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, James was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool,[594] who he has claimed his support for.[595] As a result of his endorsement money and NBA salary, James has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes.[596] In 2013, he surpassed Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million.[597] In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones.[598] In 2015, James was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson,[599] and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi).[600] James has stated that he would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity.[601] In 2011, James co-founded the designer retail store UNKNWN in Miami, Florida.[602] During Super Bowl LVI in 2022, James appeared in a Crypto.com advertisement, where he conversed with a CGI version of his younger self, offering advice about the future. The commercial, produced by James' SpringHill Company and directed by Calmatic, did not directly promote the service, sparked social media buzz, and inspired a series of memes centered on the advice he could have offered.[603] Subsequently, Crypto.com launched an NFT airdrop campaign, distributing 5,550 tokens featuring the NBA champion. Participants were chosen randomly from those who scanned a QR code in the Super Bowl ad.[604] Also, in 2022, James' charity LeBron James Family Foundation, partnered with Crypto.com to educate underserved Akron communities with blockchain-related knowledge and Web3 tools, aiming to ensure inclusive advancement in the digital age.[605][606] James and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards.[607] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live.[608] James has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage.[609] In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck,[610] receiving positive reviews for his performance.[611] That same year, James' digital video company Uninterrupted raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski and cornerback Richard Sherman.[612] James and his business partner Maverick Carter own production company SpringHill Entertainment,[613] whose first work was the Lions Gate documentary More Than a Game, which was released in 2009 and chronicled James' high school years.[614] Series produced by SpringHill include the NBC game show The Wall,[615] the Disney XD sports documentary show Becoming,[616] the Starz sitcom Survivor's Remorse,[617] and the animated web series The LeBrons.[618] In 2016, CNBC aired an unscripted series hosted by James called Cleveland Hustles, where four up-and-coming Northern Ohio entrepreneurs will be financed on the condition of revitalizing a neighborhood in Cleveland.[619] In the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, a 60-minute Vince Carter documentary entitled The Carter Effect was executive produced by James and Maverick Carter along with rapper Drake and Future the Prince.[620][621] In February 2018, it was announced that James' production company will produce a new film in the House Party series with James expected to make a cameo.[622] Later that month, Fox News host Laura Ingraham told James to \"shut up and dribble\" as a response to his political agendas.[623] This largely contributed to James creating a documentary film series looking at the changing role of athletes in the current political and cultural climate, aptly named, Shut Up and Dribble on Showtime.[624] James partnered with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2018 to found Ladder, a company that developed nutritional supplements to help athletes with severe cramps after dealing with that issue during the 2014 Finals.[625] In February 2019, it was revealed that James would executive produce rapper 2 Chainz's new album Rap or Go to the League.[626] A Def Jam press release said the intent of the album is \"celebrating black excellence and focusing on the power of education and entrepreneurship.\" The press release also says the title \"challenges the notion that the only way out of the inner city is either to become a rapper or a ball player.\"[627] As of June 2023, James is the most followed basketball player on Instagram, with over 155 million followers.[628] In June 2022, it was announced James was launching a media company in partnership with professional tennis player Naomi Osaka and Maverick Carter. The production and content creation company will be named Hana Kuma, which means \"flower\" and \"bear\" in Japanese.[629] In March 2024, James and JJ Redick launched a podcast called Mind the Game, where the two have \"pure conversations about basketball.\"[630][631][632] In 2012, James, Carter and Paul Wachter made an investment of less than $1 million in the Pasadena-based fast casual chain Blaze Pizza; their investment had grown to $25 million by 2017.[633] James later became a spokesman for the company and began appearing in advertisements after ending his contract with McDonald's.[633] During the 2019 offseason, James filed for a trademark through a shell company on the term \"Taco Tuesday\" for use in downloadable audio/visual works, podcasts, social media, online marketing, and entertainment services.[634] This was related to James's use of the term on Instagram for his family's taco dinners. The request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, stating that Taco Tuesday was \"a commonplace term, message or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment.\"[635] In November 2020, James became an angel investor of the tequila and mezcal company Lobos 1707.[636] After personal frustration with comments on the Black Lives Matter movement made by Republican U.S. senator Kelly Loeffler, who at the time was the owner of the WNBA's Atlanta Dream, James assisted Dream player Renee Montgomery in her ultimately successful bid to buy the team in March 2021.[637] That same year, James joined Fenway Sports Group as a partner, making him a part-owner of the Boston Red Sox, New England Sports Network, RFK Racing, and Liverpool F.C., the latter of which he already owned a two-percent share in individually.[638] The investment made James and Carter the company's first black partners.[638] James has expressed his interest in owning an NBA team once he finishes playing basketball, specifically a team located in Las Vegas, Nevada, either through expansion or relocation.[639] In August 2022, James, alongside Canadian musician Drake, became part owners of the Italian football club A.C. Milan.[640] James is also a part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL).[641] James is represented by agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports.[642] His first agent was Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012.[643] James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mims—all childhood friends—formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James's marketing, including the marketing of The Decision, for which it was criticized.[644][645] Throughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his NBA contracts, usually opting to sign shorter-term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility;[115][646][647] in 2006, James and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season.[648] This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign together with the Heat.[649] During the 2011 NBA lockout, James received contract offers to play professional football from the Dallas Cowboys and Seattle Seahawks,[650] which he gave serious consideration to and even began training with it in mind.[651] During his second stint in Cleveland, based on a negotiation strategy devised by NBA agent Mark Termini, who worked with Paul and specialized in contract negotiation and construction,[652] James began opting out,[653] or re-signing,[654][655] on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap.[174] In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal,[656] becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.[657]",

                "content": "LeBron Raymone James Sr. (born December 30, 1984[2]) is an American professional basketball player who plays in the National Basketball Association (NBA) on the Los Angeles Lakers with 17 titles. He is married with Savannah Brinson James and has 3 children. They are Bronny James, Bryce James, and Zhuri James. He is also a film producer and a business man. Among the best basketball players of the twenty-first century, he has a lot of experience. Both Space Jam: A New Legacy and Trainwreck featured him as himself. He is the proprietor of the SpringHill Company. The Cleveland Cavaliers picked him in the 2003 NBA Draft with the first pick in the draft, not only for his athletics ability but for the revenue he could bring to the team and city. James did not play college basketball, and entered the NBA Draft immediately after high school. He went to high school in Akron, Ohio. James played with the Cavaliers for his first seven seasons. During that time, he was one of the NBA's top scorers. He was selected as an All-Star several times. In 2007, he led Cleveland to the NBA Finals. He was the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the NBA for the 2008-09 NBA season and 2009-10 NBA season. On July 8, 2010, on a show in ESPN called \"The Decision\" LeBron said that he would next play for the Miami Heat.[3] On December 2, 2010, James played in Cleveland for the first time since leaving, scoring 38 points for the Heat as they beat the Cavaliers, 118-90. Many fans angry at James for leaving Cleveland booed him throughout the game and held up signs with negative statements against James.[4] In the 2011 season the Miami Heat came in second place right behind the Chicago Bulls lead by Derrick Rose in the NBA. They made it to the finals of the NBA and lost in six games to the Dallas Mavericks [5] This caused celebration in Cleveland because they hated LeBron for what he did to them.[6] In the 2012 Finals, LeBron James won his first championship after the Miami Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 4-1 games, after battling with the Boston Celtics 4-3 games the previous round. The next year, LeBron James won his second title when the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in seven games. In both years he won the MVP title of finals and of regular season. In 2014, James competed a good season but he wasn't the MVP. In the 2014 Finals, the Heat's Finals streak ended after being defeated by the San Antonio Spurs in five games (4-1).[7] Shortly after those Finals had ended, LeBron James said he would use an early termination option in his contract, leaving the Miami Heat and becoming a free agent. He said this on June 24, 2014.[8] Then, on June 25, 2014, in a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated, he said he would return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. On July 12, 2014, James signed a two-year, $42.1 million contract to return to the Cavaliers. The deal also contains an option to become a free agent again after the 2014–15 NBA season.[9] LeBron now plays on the Los Angeles Lakers. In 2015, he took the Cleveland Cavaliers to the NBA Finals, without Kevin Love but lost to the Golden State Warriors in 6 games after losing Kyrie Irving after he had an ankle injury. He led the Cleveland Cavaliers to an NBA championship after being down 3-1 games to their first-ever title in 2016 and later played a crucial role in bringing glory to the Los Angeles Lakers.[10] No team had ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals before. He had a historic moment where he blocked Andre Iguodala on possibly the game winning layup. The Cavaliers went on to lose to the Golden State Warriors the following season. Now with the Lakers he passed Kobe Bryant. On August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers on a two-year, $97.1M deal.[11][12] The contract extension made James the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9M, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings.[13] In 2021, James starred in Space Jam: A New Legacy where he played a version of himself. LeBron is widely considered to be the greatest basketball player of all time, as well as one of the most influential athletes and sports players in the world.[14] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 38,387-point total during a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Currently, LeBron is staying at 40,474, which is 2087 higher than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He was the youngest player to reach this point. He is also well known for his assists, and with 10,759, he is now the player with the fourth-most assistances. James and Michael Jordan are the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA title, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same calendar year. The USA would go on to win the Olympics twice.[15] Since even before he made his NBA debut, James has been associated with Nike. They In 2003, he agreed to a seven-year contract with the business that was worth little under $90 million. Many people at the time questioned whether Nike put a little too much faith in an 18-year-old who had never played a professional game. LeBron became one of the biggest players in the NBA and a four-time MVP as a result of the risk, which paid off brilliantly. James has been a success for Nike off the court as well, in addition to on it. Until now the sales of his signature sneaker reached $340 million between February 2014 and January 2015, making him the highest-paid employee at the company.[16]",

LeBron James is an American professional basketball player who is widely considered one of the greatest all-around basketball players of all time. James has won four National Basketball Association championships with three different teams, and he has been named NBA MVP four times. In 2023 he became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, and in 2024 he became the first NBA player to score 40,000 points. James has also won gold medals at the Olympics, in 2008 and 2012. LeBron James, who was born in 1984 in Akron, Ohio, became a locally known basketball prodigy while in elementary school. James led Akron’s St. Vincent–St. Mary High School to three state championships in four years. He was named Ohio’s Mr. Basketball—the high-school player of the year—three times during 2001–03. LeBron James was selected first overall in the 2003 National Basketball Association draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He played for the Cavaliers through the end of the 2009–10 season. He then signed with the Miami Heat but returned to the Cavaliers in 2014. James joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018. He won NBA championships with all three teams. LeBron James has won four National Basketball Association championships. He won his first two championships with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013. He won a third championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. His fourth championship came with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020. LeBron James (born December 30, 1984, Akron, Ohio, U.S.) is an American professional basketball player who is widely considered one of the greatest all-around players of all time and who won National Basketball Association (NBA) championships with the Miami Heat (2012 and 2013), the Cleveland Cavaliers (2016), and the Los Angeles Lakers (2020). In 2023 he became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, breaking the record (38,387) previously held by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. His dominance continued when in 2024, he recorded his 40,000 point scored. Find out where he ranks in our list of the greatest basketball players. A locally known basketball prodigy since elementary school, James was named Ohio’s Mr. Basketball (high-school player of the year) three times while leading Akron’s St. Vincent–St. Mary High School to three Ohio state championships in his four years on the team. He became a national media sensation in his junior year after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated, where he was billed by the magazine as “The Chosen One.” James was the consensus national high-school player of the year in his senior season, and he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall selection of the 2003 NBA draft. Additionally, he signed an unprecedented $90 million endorsement contract with the Nike shoe company before he ever played a professional game. Despite the pressures brought on by these singular circumstances, James led the Cavaliers in scoring, steals, and minutes played over the course of the 2003–04 season, winning the league’s Rookie of the Year award in the process. A 6-foot 9-inch (2.06-meter) “point forward” who was as adept at bringing the ball down the court as at playing near the basket, James presented a unique challenge for opposing teams; his unmatched athleticism and well-muscled body would not have been out of place in the National Football League. His game progressed over the following years. He was voted one of the starting forwards on the Eastern Conference All-Star team during his second season, and in his third season he led the Cavaliers to their first playoff berth in nine years. These accomplishments were exceeded during the 2006–07 season, when James guided Cleveland to the franchise’s first berth in the NBA finals. After the Cavaliers upset the favored Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals, the Cavaliers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA finals, but James’s impressive postseason play led many observers to place him among the very best players in the league. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2007–08 season and earned first team All-NBA honors, but the Cavaliers lost to the eventual champion Boston Celtics in a dramatic seven-game series in the Eastern Conference semifinals. James piloted the Cavaliers to a team-record 66 wins during the 2008–09 season, which helped to earn him the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. The following season James averaged nearly 30 points per game as he was again named MVP. At the end of the 2009–10 season, James became arguably the most sought-after free agent in NBA history when his contract with the Cavaliers expired, and he began a prolonged courtship process with a number of teams that had in some cases been planning for his free agency for over two years. In an unprecedented hour-long television special, criticized by many for its undue grandiosity, James announced that he was signing with the Heat. He helped Miami reach the NBA finals in his first year with the team, but the Heat lost the championship to the Dallas Mavericks. In the 2011–12 season James averaged 27.1 points per game and won his third MVP award while helping Miami advance to its second consecutive NBA finals appearance. Backed by his stellar play—James was named the finals MVP—the Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder to win the championship. He had arguably his greatest individual season in 2012–13, as he averaged 26.8 points, 7.3 assists, and a career-high 8.0 rebounds per game while posting a .565 field-goal percentage, a remarkable rate of made shots for someone who so frequently played away from the basket. James also helped Miami win 27 consecutive games that season (the second longest such streak in NBA history), and he was rewarded with his fourth league MVP award. In the following postseason, the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in a seven-game series to win the NBA championship, and James was again named the finals MVP. He continued his stellar play in the following season, even increasing his shooting percentage by .002, and he again led the Heat to an appearance in the NBA finals. However, Miami lost that rematch with the Spurs in a five-game series. After that finals loss, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, leaving an aging Miami roster, and—after a week of frenzied speculation among fans and media—he decided to return to Cleveland. Although his 25.3 points per game was James’s lowest scoring average since his rookie season, he nevertheless guided a young and inexperienced Cavaliers roster to the second best record in the Eastern Conference in 2014–15. In the following postseason he led an injury-laden Cleveland team to just two playoff losses en route to a berth in the NBA finals. There James had one of the greatest individual performances in finals history, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game while leading the undermanned Cavaliers to the franchise’s first two finals victories before ultimately losing a six-game series to the Golden State Warriors. James had another strong regular season in 2015–16 but, once again, truly shined in the playoffs. He led the Cavaliers to a rematch against the Warriors, who had set a league record with 73 wins during the regular season, in the NBA finals. There the Cavaliers became the first team to come back from a 3–1 finals deficit to capture the first title in franchise history and end a 52-year title drought for Cleveland professional sports teams. James averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.6 steals, and 2.3 blocks per game in the finals—becoming the first person to lead all five statistical categories for players on both teams in the finals—and was unanimously named finals MVP. In 2016–17 James had arguably his best regular season by setting career highs with averages of 8.7 assists and 8.6 rebounds per game while still scoring 26.4 points per game. He sustained his excellence in the Eastern Conference playoffs, scoring 32.5 points per game (which included his 5,988th career postseason point, breaking Michael Jordan’s all-time NBA playoff scoring record) while leading the Cavaliers to a third consecutive match-up against the Warriors in the NBA finals. There Cleveland could not overcome the team James referred to as a “juggernaut,” losing to the Warriors in five games despite James becoming the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double over the course of the finals (with 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game). In 2017–18 he played a full 82-game regular season for the first time in his career and led the NBA in minutes played per game (36.9) while averaging 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, and a new career-high 9.1 assists per game. James again excelled in the following playoffs, scoring more than 40 points seven times in the team’s 18 Eastern Conference postseason games (which included two seven-game series) to lead the Cavaliers to their fourth straight NBA finals series against the Warriors. He continued his strong individual play in the finals, but it was not enough to overcome Golden State’s overwhelming talent advantage, and the Warriors swept the series. In the following off-season, James, a free agent, joined the Los Angeles Lakers. He continued to play at a high level, averaging 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game, but he missed significant playing time because of an injury (a strained groin) for the first time in his career. The Lakers struggled in his absence and ultimately finished the 2018–19 season with a 37–45 record, ending James’s personal playoff streak at 13 seasons. The following season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a four-month suspension. Play resumed in July 2020 with a shortened schedule, and the Lakers ultimately defeated the Miami Heat to claim the franchise’s 17th NBA title. James’s dominating performance—he averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game—earned him his fourth finals MVP award. In addition to his achievements in the NBA, James was a member of the U.S. men’s Olympic basketball teams that won the bronze medal at the 2004 Games, the gold medal at the 2008 Games, and the gold at the 2012 Games. James did not return to Olympic competition until the 2024 Paris Games, and there he led the U.S. team to a fifth consecutive gold medal and was named the tournament’s MVP. Off the court, James occasionally acted, notably appearing as himself in Judd Apatow’s comedy Trainwreck (2015). In 2021 he appeared in the live-action/animated Space Jam: A New Legacy. James also published a memoir, Shooting Stars (2009; cowritten with Buzz Bissinger), that chronicles his years as a high-school standout.",

He averaged 31.6 points per game, helping his team clinch their third state title. The St. Vincent-St. Mary High School team also earned the top national ranking that year. Throughout his high school playing career, James totaled 2,657 points, 892 rebounds, and 523 assists. He would soon emerged as one of the NBA’s leading players. With his impressive record, it was no surprise that James was the first player picked in the 2003 NBA Draft straight out of high school. The Cleveland Cavaliers signed the powerful young forward, and he proved to be a valuable addition to the then-struggling franchise. The team had ended the previous season in eighth place in the Eastern Conference. During the 2003-04 season, James made history when he became the first member of the Cavalier franchise to win the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. At only 20 years old, he also became the youngest player to receive this honor. Additionally, James averaged 20 points per game at this time and became one of only three rookies to accomplish this feat, putting him in the same company as Michael Jordan and Oscar Robertson. James continued to excel professionally in the NBA the following season, upping his average points per game to 27.2. He made NBA history again in 2005 when he became the youngest player to score more than 50 points in one game. In 2006, James helped the Cleveland Cavaliers defeat the Washington Wizards in the first round of playoff action. From there, his team took on the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference semifinals. James scored an average of 26.6 per game in this postseason matchup, but it wasn’t enough to secure victory. While the Cavaliers weren’t at the top of the rankings, James continued to receive special recognition for his individual abilities. Also that year, James reached a new contract agreement with the Cavaliers. The team proved to be stronger competitors the following season, defeating Detroit to win the Eastern Conference. In the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, however, the Cavaliers lost their championship bid in four consecutive games. During the 2007-08 season, James continued to help the Cavaliers improve their standing in the Eastern Conference. The team made it to the semifinals, where they were defeated by the Boston Celtics in seven games. In terms of individual performance, James had a stellar year, outperforming such rival players as Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson, by scoring an average of 30 points per game, the highest average in the NBA regular season. Early in the 2008-09 season, sports journalists and fans began talking about James’ future in the sport. He had the option to become a free agent in 2010, and there was much discussion as to where James would end up. Some journalists identified the New York Knicks as a potential suitor for the rising player. James made several references to his impending free-agent status, but he was sure to downplay the matter. “I am focused on the team that I am on right now and winning a championship... I don’t think about making a change at this point,” James told reporters. Shortly after becoming a free agent, James announced that he would be joining the Miami Heat for the 2010-11 season. His fans in Cleveland were less than pleased, and many considered his departure a betrayal to his hometown. Soon after James’ announcement, Cleveland Cavaliers majority owner Dan Gilbert wrote an open letter declaring James’ decision as “selfish,” “heartless” and a “cowardly betrayal.” Unfazed, James finished second in the league during his first season with the Heat, scoring 26.7 points per game. The 2011-12 season saw major success for James and the Miami Heat. With his team’s victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals, the superstar forward finally earned his first title. In the clinching Game 5, James scored 26 points and had 11 rebounds and 13 assists. “I made a difficult decision to leave Cleveland, but I understood what my future was about,” James told Fox Sports following the game. “I knew we had a bright future [in Miami].” During the 2012-13 season, James made NBA history yet again: On January 16, 2013, at age 28, he became the youngest player to score 20,000 points, succeeding Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers—who accomplished this feat when he was 29—and becoming only the 38th player in NBA history to achieve this distinction. James made a jump shot the final seconds of the game, bringing his scoring total 20,001 and leading the Heat to a 92-75 victory over the Golden State Warriors. Success followed the Heat to the end of the 2012-13 season: Following a hard-fought, six-game series against the Indiana Pacers to win the Eastern Conference, Miami outlasted the San Antonio Spurs in seven games to win its second consecutive NBA championship. At the culmination of the 2013-14 season, Miami returned to the NBA Finals to face off against the Spurs again, this time losing to San Antonio after five games. In July 2014, after opting out of his contract with the Heat and considering other teams, James announced that he was returning to the Cavaliers. Hampered by back and knee problems, James missed 13 of 82 regular-season games in 2014-15. However, he was as dominant as ever when healthy, averaging 25.3 points and 7.4 assists per game. James led the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals, becoming the first player in nearly 50 years to reach the championship round in five consecutive seasons. However, injuries to star teammates Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving damaged his hopes of claiming a third title, and the Cavaliers lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games. Over the course of 2015-16, the Cavs overcame the distraction of a mid-season coaching change and breezed through the playoffs to earn a rematch with the Warriors, marking the sixth straight NBA Finals appearance for “King James.” In perhaps the crowning achievement of his career, he led his team back from a 3-1 deficit, scoring 41 points in both Games 5 and 6, before recording a triple-double in Game 7 to give the Cavs their first championship in franchise history. Voted Finals MVP, James said: “I came back to bring a championship to our city. I knew what I was capable of doing. I knew what I learned in the last couple years that I was gone, and I knew if I had to—when I came back—I knew I had the right ingredients and the right blueprint to help this franchise get back to a place that we’ve never been. That’s what it was all about.” The following year, James again paced himself and took charge when necessary, driving the Cavs through the Eastern Conference to make an incredible seventh consecutive appearance in the NBA Finals. This time, with former MVP Kevin Durant added to the mix, the Warriors proved too formidable for James and his teammates, who lost the championship in five games. For all his accomplishments, James achieved another first early in the 2017-18 NBA season: After yelling at a referee during a late November win over the Heat, he was ejected for the first time in 1,082 career games. The superstar likely felt like yelling often during the course of a frustrating campaign, as an offseason trade that sent Irving to Boston for Isaiah Thomas failed to bear fruit and forced the Cavs to make another major deal before the All-Star break. After averaging a career-best 9.1 assists in the regular season, James had to dig deep just to get the team out of the first round of the playoffs, delivering a brilliant 45-point effort to sink the Pacers in Game 7. The Cavs were again pushed to the limit two rounds later by the scrappy Boston Celtics, but James scored 81 points over the last two games to pull out the series win and make his eighth straight NBA Finals appearance. Game 1 of the rematch against Golden State went down to the wire, thanks to James’ 51-point outburst, but Cleveland guard J.R. Smith inexplicably dribbled out the clock with the game tied in regulation before the Warriors pulled away for the win in overtime. That represented the Cavs’ best chance to get a leg up on their opponents, as the Warriors won the next three games handily to claim their third title in four years. Afterward, with questions swirling about his future with the team, James revealed that he had played out the series with a broken right hand after punching a whiteboard in the aftermath of the Game 1 loss. On July 1, 2018, James announced that he was moving on to the next chapter of his career by signing a four-year, $153.3 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, a storied franchise that counted Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Magic Johnson among its all-time greats. The good vibes had worn off by midseason, as the Lakers sputtered through a 17-game stretch without their injured star. With the team still struggling in late February 2019, James accused his teammates of losing focus over trade rumors, saying, “If you’re still allowing distractions to affect the way you play, this is the wrong franchise to be a part of and you should just come in and be like, ‘Listen, I can’t do this.’” When the Lakers were officially eliminated from playoff contention in March 2019, it snapped James’ personal marks of 13 consecutive postseasons and eight straight NBA Finals appearances. Capping a difficult first season in Los Angeles, the Lakers announced that their star would miss the final six games because of his lingering groin injury. Things got off to a much better start the following season, thanks in large part to the addition of athletic big man Anthony Davis to the roster. Spearheading the Lakers’ rise to the top of the standings was James, who became the first player to record a triple-double against all 30 NBA teams in November 2019. The following month, James added another accolade to his ever-growing list by earning AP Male Athlete of the Decade honors. James won his fourth championship in 2020, when the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in a special playoff tournament held at the Walt Disney World resort following the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. James was selected for the NBA All-Star Game for the first time in 2005 and has earned a spot in the annual showcase in each of the next 19 seasons—an NBA record streak. In January 2018, the league announced James and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry had topped the ballots and would serve as captains for that year’s All-Star Game. In 2006, James was named MVP in the NBA All-Star Game, a feat he repeated in 2008 and 2018. James has also been named NBA MVP in four seasons: 2008-09, 2009-10, 2011-12, and 2012-13. In January 2018, at age 33, James surpassed Kobe Bryant as the youngest player to accumulate 30,000 career points and became the seventh player in NBA history to achieve that milestone. The feat put him just more than 8,000 points shy of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s all-time record of 38,387 points. James continued to surpass other legends in ensuing seasons, topping Michael Jordan’s career tally of 32,292 points in 2019 to move into fourth place all-time. In January 2020, he eclipsed Bryant’s total of 33,643 points to move into third place, one night before his predecessor’s shocking death in a helicopter accident. Then, on February 7, 2023, James scored 38 points in a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder—setting the all-time mark with Abdul-Jabbar sitting courtside. “I didn’t set this as a goal, so that’s probably why it’s so surreal and so weird to me,” James said. “I never talked about being the all-time scorer in NBA history… until my numbers started getting closer and closer, and I was like, ‘Oh wow, this is crazy. This is weird, but I guess I’m doing it.’” As of July 2024, James is also fourth in league history in assists (11,009) and eighth in steals (2,275). After 21 NBA seasons, James’ stats include regular season per-game averages of: James has competed on the U.S. Olympic basketball team during four Summer Olympic Games: in 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2024. He made his Olympic debut at the 2004 Summer Games in Athens, Greece. He and his teammates won bronze medals after defeating Lithuania. Argentina took home the gold after beating Italy in the finals. In the summer of 2008, James traveled to Beijing to play with the likes of Kobe Bryant, Jason Kidd, and Dwyane Wade on Team USA. This time around the Americans brought home the gold after defeating Spain in the final round. James competed at his third Olympic Games in 2012, at the Summer Olympics in London, along with Kevin Durant, Bryant, Carmelo Anthony, and several other top players. The U.S. basketball team took the gold medal again, marking James’ second consecutive Olympic gold. After sitting out the 2016 and 2020 Games, James is competing for his third gold medal at the Paris Olympics this year. He was also selected to serve as the male flag bearer for the entire U.S. delegation at the opening ceremony. As of July 2024, Celebrity Net Worth estimates James’ total fortune at around $800 million. According to ESPN, he is currently the sixth-highest paid player in the NBA, earning just under $50 million for the upcoming season. James’ fortune largely stems from his playing salary and a series of lucrative endorsements. The NBA superstar previously signed a four-year, $153.3 million contract with the Lakers in July 2018. Off the court, James has inked several partnerships since turning pro, including a deal with Nike for $90 million that could net him over $1 billion over his lifetime. Some of his other endorsements have included Intel, Verizon, Coca-Cola, Beats by Dre, and Kia Motors. James is also an investor in Blaze Pizza. On January 1, 2012, James proposed to his high school sweetheart, Savannah Brinson. The couple married in a private ceremony with about 200 guests in San Diego on September 14, 2013. LeBron and Savannah have two sons and one daughter together. In October 2004, they welcomed their first son, LeBron Jr., nicknamed “Bronny.” On June 14, 2007, Savannah gave birth to their second son, Bryce. Their daughter, Zhuri, was born on October 22, 2014. Like his father, Bronny became a basketball phenom as a teenager and one of the most sought-after recruits in the country while attending the Sierra Canyon School. He played collegiately at the University of Southern California during the 2023-24 season before entering the NBA draft. The Lakers selected Bronny with the 55th overall pick, pairing him with his father in Los Angeles. “I’m going to hold him accountable, and he should hold me accountable when I do things not right. I can separate dad from teammate,” LeBron told Today. “And, I think, as he continues to grow, and as he continues to learn, I hope he’s able to separate son from teammate, as well.” Outside of the NBA, James has worked to help others. He established the LeBron James Family Foundation in 2004, along with his mother, Gloria, to help out children and single-parent families in need. Among its many programs, the organization builds playgrounds in economically disadvantaged areas and hosts an annual bike-a-thon. One of the world’s most recognizable athletes, James hasn’t been shy about expressing his views on social media. Among other issues, he displayed his support for Trayvon Martin after the teen’s death in 2012, and he has clashed with President Donald Trump. James waded into delicate territory in October 2019, after Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey posted a tweet in support of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters that ignited a Chinese media boycott of NBA preseason games in the country. James said he believed Morey was “misinformed” about the situation, though he later tweeted that he mainly took issue with the executive posting comments that could have exposed traveling players to danger. The basketball superstar has also shown a playful side on social media, such as when he posted a picture of cartoon character Arthur clenching his first during the Cavaliers’ slow start to the 2017-18 season. Like many pro athletes before him, James parlayed his popularity into opportunities on the big and small screen. On television, James has had guest roles on the popular cartoons The Simpsons (2005), SpongeBob SquarePants (2009), and The Cleveland Show (2011), and appeared as himself on the HBO drama Entourage in 2009. James made his major movie with a supporting role in 2015’s Trainwreck, a comedy starring Amy Schumer and Bill Hader. He later starred in Space Jam 2, the 2021 sequel to the hit 1996 live-action and cartoon hybrid starring Michael Jordan. “The Space Jam collaboration is so much more than just me and the Looney Tunes getting together and doing this movie,” James told The Hollywood Reporter. “It’s so much bigger. I’d just love for kids to understand how empowered they can feel and how empowered they can be if they don’t just give up on their dreams.” In 2020, the basketball great co-founded a production company called SpringHill Entertainment.

                "content": "LeBron James is an American basketball player. He is considered to be one of the best all-around players to ever play the game. He led his teams to four National Basketball Association (NBA) championships. In 2023 he became the all-time leading scorer in the game. James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio. He began playing sports in the fourth grade and soon became a star player. In high school he led the basketball team to three state championships. He was named Ohio’s Mr. Basketball (high-school player of the year) three times. In 2003, his last year in high school, he was named the national high-school player of the year. Soon after, James joined the NBA when the Cleveland Cavaliers chose him as the first overall draft pick. During his first season with the Cavaliers, James led the team in scoring, steals, and minutes played. His performance earned him the title of the NBA’s Rookie of the Year. James earned a spot on the All-Star team during his second season (2004–05). In his third season he led the Cavaliers to the playoffs for the first time in nine years. James won the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) award for his play during the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons. After the 2009–10 season James left Cleveland and joined the Miami Heat. James helped the Heat advance to the NBA championship finals four times. They won two championships, in 2012 and in 2013. While he was with the Heat, James received two more league MVP awards (for the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons). James moved back to the Cleveland Cavaliers for the 2014–15 season. He led the team to four championship finals in a row (2015–2018). The Cavaliers took home the championship in 2016. After the 2017–18 season James joined the Los Angeles Lakers. In 2020 James led the Lakers to an NBA championship and was named MVP of the finals. James was also a member of four U.S. men’s Olympic basketball teams. The teams won bronze in 2004 and gold in 2008, 2012, and 2024. James published a memoir, Shooting Stars (written with Buzz Bissinger), in 2009. The book explores his years as a high-school basketball star. We’ve been busy, working hard to bring you new features and an updated design. We hope you and your family enjoy the NEW Britannica Kids.

                "content": "De'Vondre Campbell (born July 1, 1993) is an American professional football linebacker for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Hutchinson Community College before transferring to Minnesota and was selected by the Atlanta Falcons in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL draft. Campbell has also played for the Arizona Cardinals and the Green Bay Packers. After playing at the junior college level for Hutchinson Community College, Campbell played Minnesota Golden Gophers football from 2013 to 2015.[1] As a sophomore in 2013, he recorded 39 total tackles, three tackles-for-loss, and a forced fumble.[2] In 2014, Campbell recorded 75 total tackles, 6.5 tackles-for-loss, 2.5 sacks, an interception, a pass defended, and three fumble recoveries.[3] In his final collegiate season in 2015, Campbell recorded 92 total tackles, 6.5 tackles-for-loss, four sacks, an interception, three passes defended, and two forced fumbles.[4] The Atlanta Falcons selected Campbell in the fourth round (115th overall) of the 2016 NFL draft. He was the second linebacker drafted by the Falcons in 2016, behind LSU's Deion Jones.[6] He was also the 16th overall linebacker drafted in 2016.[7][8] On May 5, 2016, the Falcons signed Campbell to a four-year, $2.90 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $565,528.[9] Throughout training camp, Campbell competed to be a starting outside linebacker against Sean Weatherspoon and Philip Wheeler.[10] Head coach Dan Quinn named Campbell the starting weakside linebacker to begin the regular season, alongside Deion Jones and Vic Beasley.[11] Campbell made his professional regular season debut and first career start in the season-opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and recorded four solo tackles in the 31–24 loss. On September 16, 2016, it was reported that Campbell had sustained an ankle injury during practice. His ankle injury sidelined him for the next four games (Weeks 2–5).[12] On October 23, 2016, Campbell collected a season-high ten combined tackles (six solo) during a 33–30 overtime loss to the San Diego Chargers in Week 7. During a Week 12 38–19 victory over the Arizona Cardinals in Week 12, Campbell recorded four solo tackles, made a season-high three pass deflections, and his first career interception off a pass attempt by Cardinals' quarterback Carson Palmer that was intended for tight end Jermaine Gresham to seal the victory in the fourth quarter.[13] Campbell was inactive during the Falcons' Week 16 victory at the Carolina Panthers after suffering a concussion the previous week.[14] Campbell finished his rookie season with 48 combined tackles (35 solo), seven passes defensed, a forced fumble, and an interception in 11 games and 10 starts.[15][16] The Falcons finished atop the NFC South with an 11–5 record in 2016 and earned a first round bye. On January 14, 2017, Campbell started his first career playoff game and recorded four combined tackles during a 36–20 victory over the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Divisional Round. During the NFC Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers, he recorded two tackles as the Falcons won by a score of 44–22. On February 5, 2017, Campbell started in Super Bowl LI and recorded four total tackles as the Falcons were defeated 34–28 by the New England Patriots in overtime.[17] On February 8, 2017, the Falcons fired defensive coordinator Richard Smith after they lost a 28–3 lead in the Super Bowl and allowed the Patriots to score 31 points in the second half of the game.[18] Two days later, the Falcons announced their decision to promote secondary coach Marquand Manuel to defensive coordinator.[19] Campbell entered training camp slated as the starting strongside linebacker after Vic Beasley was moved closer to an edge rushing defensive end role.[20] Head coach Dan Quinn named Campbell the starting strongside linebacker to begin the regular season, alongside weakside linebacker Duke Riley and middle linebacker Deion Jones.[21] On September 17, 2017, Campbell recorded eight combined tackles, deflected a pass, and made his first NFL sack on Packers' quarterback Aaron Rodgers during a 34–23 victory over the Packers. In Week 10, Campbell collected a season-high 13 combined tackles in a 27–7 victory against the Dallas Cowboys.[22] Campbell started in all 16 games in 2017 and recorded 92 combined tackles (61 solo), four pass deflections, and two sacks.[23] Campbell returned as the starting strongside linebacker to begin 2018, along with Duke Riley and Deion Jones.[24] He played in 16 games with 13 starts, finishing with a team-leading 94 combined tackles, and 1.5 sacks.

On June 9, 2021, Campbell signed with the Packers.[30] He was named the starting inside linebacker alongside Krys Barnes. In a 35–17 win over the Detroit Lions in Week 2, Campbell notched an interception thrown by Lions quarterback Jared Goff. He caught his second interception on the season in a 25–22 overtime victory over the Cincinnati Bengals when he caught an errant pass thrown by Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow in the first play of overtime. Campbell won the NFC Defensive Player of the Month award for his performances during the month of October. In five games during that month (all of them wins), Campbell recorded 45 total tackles (three for loss), one sack, one interception, two forced fumbles, two pressures, and two pass deflections; he had a season-high 14 tackles on October 24 during a Week 7 victory over the Washington Football Team.[31] On January 14, 2022, Campbell was named a first-team member of the 2021 All-Pro Team, becoming the first Packers inside linebacker to achieve this honor since Ray Nitschke in 1966. He finished the season as PFF's second-highest graded linebacker, behind Micah Parsons of the Dallas Cowboys.[32] On March 17, 2022, Campbell re-signed with the Packers on a five-year deal, worth $50 million.[33][34] On October 23, 2022, during a Week 7 loss to the Washington Commanders, Campbell intercepted a pass from Taylor Heinicke and returned it 63 yards for his first NFL touchdown.[35] Campbell was released on March 13, 2024.[36] On March 18, 2024, Campbell signed a one–year contract with the San Francisco 49ers.[37] Campbell started 12 of the 49ers' first 13 games, filling in for injured linebacker Dre Greenlaw.[38] With the return of Greenlaw in the 49ers' Week 15 matchup against the Los Angeles Rams, Campbell was relegated to a reserve role and did not play in the first half.[39] With Greenlaw experiencing fatigue, the team asked Campbell to enter the game, but he refused and later left for the locker room in the second half as the 49ers lost 12–6.[40]",

It was less than a year ago that the San Francisco 49ers were on top of the world, preparing to play in Super Bowl LVIII against the Kansas City Chiefs. This season is a much different story, with the team undergoing a slew of issues that has resulted in it sitting in last place in the NFC West at 6-8. The latest drama to come out of San Francisco stemmed from this week's \"Thursday Night Football\" divisional matchup against the Los Angeles Rams. The rain-soaked game was the first of the NFL season with no touchdowns from either side, but the offensive struggles were far from the main storyline. After the 12-6 loss, Niners head coach Kyle Shanahan revealed that when asked to replace the injured Dre Greenlaw, linebacker De'Vondre Campbell told coaches he \"didn't want to play today\" and left for the locker room in the third quarter. Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles went in instead, as the team's only healthy player at the position. \"He said he didn't want to play today.\"— 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan on LB De'Vondre Campbell when asked to replace Dre Greenlaw pic.twitter.com/QRcmG6nZW9 \"That's somebody who doesn't want to play football, that's pretty simple,\" Shanahan said of Campbell. \"I think our team and myself, we know how we feel about that, so we don't need to talk about him anymore.\" Campbell's teammates also had a lot to say about his refusal to enter the game. Tight end George Kittle said he hadn't heard anything about the situation until he got to the locker room and added that if you're on the roster and you suit up, you're \"expected to play.\" Kittle said he doesn't know how someone could do that to their teammates and had strong words for how he felt. \"I think that's ignorant,\" Kittle said of the situation. \"And I think it's just dumb. It's just stupid, and it's very immature. I just don't see how you could do something like that to your team.\" George Kittle on De'Vondre Campbell saying he won’t play. “I just don’t see how you can do that to your team.” pic.twitter.com/bYx3BQh8ZH Kittle wished he heard about Campbell not wanting to play in real time because as a leader, he would've said something then. While this is not the entire reason the Niners couldn't pull off a win, Kittle explained that when the team is already down linebackers due to injury, it would've been beneficial to have Campbell in, or dress someone else. \"If anybody in this building got asked to go in, I would say 100% of everybody would die to be on that football field,\" Kittle said. \"People are going through random things off the field, I can't speak on that. Whatever his decision was, it wasn't for this organization. It wasn't for this team and that's on him.\" \"It's one person making a selfish decision,\" Kittle added. \"I've never been around anybody that's ever done that, and I hope I'm never around anybody who does that again.\" Cornerback Charvarius \"Mooney\" Ward was also asked about the situation and had a similar response to Kittle. He said Campbell shouldn't have dressed if he didn't want to be on the field and added that his absence \"definitely hurt the team.\" Here is the whole Mooney Ward exchange on De'Vondre Campbell refusing to go into the game tonight. Mooney was brutally honest about a guy who appeared to quit on his team. #49ers | #FTTB pic.twitter.com/CT6zNcC4t1 Campbell's future is naturally in question, with a suspension or release as two possible options. When asked if the team would release Campbell, Shanahan simply said, \"We'll figure out something.\" In his first season in San Francisco, Campbell has played in 13 games with 12 starts, recording 79 combined tackles (three for a loss), two passes defensed and one quarterback hit. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "title": "Niners HC Kyle Shanahan says De'Vondre Campbell refused to play Thursday, will 'figure something out' on LB's future",
                "content": "Digital Content Editor Nine-year pro De'Vondre Campbell declined to play for the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday and the linebacker might not be on the roster much longer. Campbell refused to enter the game in the third quarter of the 49ers' 12-6 loss to the Los Angeles Rams, head coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters after the game, and the veteran's status on the team appears uncertain at best. \"I don't know,\" Shanahan said when asked if the team would release Campbell. \"We'll figure something out.\" Niners linebacker Dre Greenlaw, playing in his first game of the season after suffering an Achilles tendon injury in the Super Bowl, felt some tightness during the third quarter and exited the game. When Campbell was asked to take the field, he declined. Shanahan said Campbell gave him no reason as to why he would not play and shortly thereafter left for the locker room. San Francisco lost for the fourth time in its last five games, dropping to 6-8 with a very slim chance of making the postseason. When asked as to whether this was a sign that he had \"lost the locker room\" amid a season of struggles, Shanahan strongly disagreed. \"I haven't lost anybody,\" he said. \"That's somebody that doesn't want to play football. That's pretty simple. I think our team and myself, we know how we feel about that. So, I don't think we need to talk about him anymore.\" It seemed as though players were united in their dismay with Campbell's decision. \"Look, if you're on the roster and you suit up, you're expected to play,\" said 49ers tight end George Kittle, who was unaware of the situation during the game. \"I think anyone in this building that got asked to go in, I would say 100% of everybody would die to get on that football field. And so, people go through, are going through random things off the field, I can't speak on that. Whatever his decision was, it wasn't for this organization, it wasn't for this team and that's on him. So, I'm not very happy about it. I wish I would've heard about it on the field, but I didn't. Now, is that the reason we lost? Absolutely not. But it's hard to win football games when someone doesn't want to play football. Especially, when you're suited up. It kinda puts you down, especially when you lose two linebackers and could have dressed another one.\" Though Shanahan didn't speculate on Campbell's future, 49ers cornerback Charvarius Ward minced no words in forecasting that Campbell would be an ex-teammate shortly. \"He's a professional, he been playing for a long time,\" said Ward, who on Thursday played in his third game since returning to the team following the death of his 1-year-old daughter. \"I mean, if he didn't want to play, he shouldn't have dressed out, he coulda told them that before the game. So, I feel like that was some sucka s--- that he did. Definitely hurt the team. 'Cause Dee went down, and we needed a linebacker. \"That's some sucka stuff to me, in my opinion. Probably gonna get cut soon, so it is what it is with that.\" Campbell, 31, did not play a snap on Thursday. A former Atlanta Falcons, Arizona Cardinals and Green Bay Packers player, Campbell signed with the 49ers this offseason, largely to fill the void left by Greenlaw. He played each of the team's first 13 games, starting 12, including last week against the Chicago Bears. Entering the evening, his 79 tackles were second on the team. Shanahan said he has never had a player refuse to play in a game before. He added some 49ers saw the situation unfold, but it wasn't a distraction. \"People noticed, but when someone says that, you move on,\" he said, \"you don't deal with that anymore.\" NFL.com keeps you up to date with all of the latest league news from around the NFL.

It marked the first time since 2018 that the Rams swept the season series. It was the Rams' defense, aided by some splash plays from Puka Nacua and the foot of rookie kicker Joshua Karty, that kept L.A.'s postseason hopes alive with a victory over the 49ers on Thursday night. Saints quarterback Jake Haener will make his first NFL start on Sunday against the Washington Commanders, NFL Network Insider Mike Garafolo reported Thursday night.

                "content": "The phrase \"No good deed goes unpunished\" is a sardonic commentary on the frequency with which acts of kindness backfire on those who offer them. In other words, those who help others are doomed to suffer as a result of their helpfulness. The phrase is first attested in Walter Map's 12th-century De nugis curialium, in whose fourth chapter the character Eudo adhered to inverted morality \"left no good deed unpunished, no bad one unrewarded\".[1][2] Conventional moral wisdom holds that evil deeds are punished by divine providence and good deeds are rewarded by divine providence:[1] For as punishment is to the evil act, so is reward to a good act. Now no evil deed is unpunished, by God the just judge. Therefore no good deed is unrewarded, and so every good deed merits some good.[a] This is related to the concepts of Hell and of karma. The modern expression \"No good deed goes unpunished\" is an ironic twist on this conventional morality.[1] The ironic usage of the phrase appears to be[weasel words] a 20th-century invention, found for example in Brendan Gill's 1950 novel The Trouble of One House.[3] It is also featured prominently in the song \"No Good Deed\", from the 2003 hit Broadway musical Wicked.[4] A satirical poem by Franklin Pierce Adams with the title \"No Good Deed Goes Unpunished (So Shines a Good Deed in a Naughty World)\" also exists.[5] In 2005, author David Helvarg introduced the concept that the punishment may be a form of retaliation, in a piece he wrote for Grist Magazine, \"Remember that sign they hung up in an EPA office during the Reagan administration, 'No good deed goes unpunished'? Under George Bush, no good science goes unpunished.\"[6]",

As well, two came from 1927 (one of which used the word \"kindness\" in place of \"good deed\") and another from 1938 (\"Every good deed brings its own punishment\"), which was the earliest match that website found which it considered to be strong.

                "content": "Morgan Cole Wallen (born May 13, 1993) is an American country singer and songwriter. He competed in the sixth season of The Voice, originally as a member of Usher's team, but later as a member of Adam Levine's team. After being eliminated in the playoffs of that season, he signed to Panacea Records, releasing his debut EP, Stand Alone, in 2015. In 2016, Wallen signed to Big Loud, releasing his debut album, If I Know Me, in 2018. The album includes the singles \"Up Down\" featuring Florida Georgia Line, \"Whiskey Glasses\", and \"Chasin' You\". If I Know Me reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Wallen's second album, Dangerous: The Double Album, was released in January 2021, and in February 2021 became the only country album in the 64-year history of the Billboard 200 to spend its first seven weeks at No. 1.[4] It spent its first ten weeks at number one, the first album to do so since Whitney Houston's Whitney in 1987.[5] The album included singles \"More Than My Hometown\", \"7 Summers\", and \"Wasted on You\".[6] His third studio album, One Thing at a Time (2023), topped the Billboard 200 for 19 non-consecutive weeks, with all of its 36 tracks entering the Billboard Hot 100. This broke the record for most songs by an artist on the chart at one time.[7] The single \"Last Night\" peaked atop the Hot 100 in 2023, becoming Wallen's first single to do so, and later set the record for the most weeks at number one for a non-collaboration song (sixteen weeks), as well as tying for the second most weeks of all time and topping the year-end chart. He has received several awards including an Academy of Country Music Award and fourteen Billboard Music Awards.[8] He won Entertainer of the Year at the 58th Annual Country Music Association Awards.[9] Morgan Cole Wallen was born on May 13, 1993, in Sneedville, Tennessee, to Tommy and Lesli Wallen.[10] Tommy served for a time as a local church pastor,[11] while Lesli worked as a teacher. In his teens, the family moved south to Knox County, where he graduated from Gibbs High School.[12] He was a pitcher and shortstop for the school's baseball team, and hoped to continue in college, but tore his ulnar collateral ligament his senior year.[13] As a child, Wallen took piano and violin lessons. He was raised on a diverse musical playlist, with his father exposing him to classic rock mainstays. In his teens, he gravitated towards bands like Breaking Benjamin and Nickelback, as well as rappers like Lil Wayne.[14] Wallen has characterized his early adulthood as adrift; he worked in landscaping after high school and was disappointed by his inability to continue his baseball career.[11] He re-approached his interest in music and began learning guitar.[14] He had grown to love country music, especially artists like Keith Whitley and Eric Church, and he modeled his sound after that lineage.[14] In 2014, Wallen competed on season 6 of the music competition program The Voice. He auditioned with the song \"Collide\" by Howie Day. Judges Shakira and Usher complimented his stylings, and Wallen joined Usher's team. He was later taken by Adam Levine's team after his second round, and later eliminated during the playoffs.[13] Wallen later said of his experience on the show, \"Some things in life are out of your control. Being the best you can be isn't. I didn't feel like I was the best I could have been. So I practiced harder\".[14] The Voice was instrumental in raising Wallen's profile, and he began to establish connections in the music industry.[12] While in California to appear on The Voice, Wallen began working with Sergio Sanchez of Atom Smash, a vocal coach on the program. Wallen relocated to Nashville to further his career, and he and Sanchez started a temporary band: Morgan Wallen & Them Shadows.[12] Sanchez introduced Wallen to Bill Ray and Paul Trust of Panacea Records.[15] In 2015, Wallen signed to Panacea Records where he was joined by Dominic Frost on guitar and released the Stand Alone (EP) on August 24, 2015. \"Spin You Around\" was Wallen's debut single under Panacea Records; it was later certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2021.[16] In 2015, Wallen's manager, Dirk Hemsath of Working Group Artist Management, sent a demo of Wallen to record executive Seth England, who had Wallen audition for Big Loud, an independent record label. They signed Wallen to the label and the publishing company,[15] who began pairing his songs with other artists. That year, he released his debut single \"The Way I Talk\";[17] his first music video for the song followed in 2017.[18] Wallen co-wrote the A Thousand Horses's single \"Preachin' to the Choir\",[13] Dallas Smith's \"The Fall\",[19] as well as Jason Aldean's \"You Make It Easy\" with Florida Georgia Line's Tyler Hubbard, Brian Kelley, and Jordan Schmidt.[20] He joined Florida Georgia Line on their Dig Your Roots Tour.[13] He collaborated with the group on the single \"Up Down\", his first song to reach the top five of Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart.[21] At the outset of his career, Wallen underwent a personal stylistic shift, adopting a distinctive mullet and a look that Kelefa Sanneh, profiling Wallen's rise in a piece for The New Yorker, described as \"Everyman rock star\" and \"not just a singer but a character\".[11] Wallen had decided to adopt the retro hairdo after seeing a younger photo of his father with the cut.[14] Wallen's debut studio album, If I Know Me, was released on April 27, 2018,[22] with its third single, \"Whiskey Glasses\", becoming his biggest success yet.[23] The song reached the top spot on both the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts; it also marked his top 40 appearance on the all-genre Hot 100 ranking, where it placed at number 17. It was Billboard's 2019 top Hot Country song and Top Country Airplay song.[24] Sanneh characterized \"Whiskey Glasses\" as his signature song and a \"perfectly constructed ode to a woman and a drink, lost and found, respectively\".[11] In 2019, Wallen joined Florida Georgia Line on their Can't Say I Ain't Country Tour.[25] His next single, \"Chasin' You\", was serviced to radio in July 2019 and peaked at number two on the Hot Country Songs chart;[26][6] like its predecessor, it captured the top spot on the overall year-end tally for 2020.[14] In August 2020, If I Know Me reached No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart after a record-breaking 114 weeks. Wallen's profile continued to rise, with a growing following on platforms like TikTok, and he developed into an unwitting sex symbol.[11] Wallen appeared on the cover of Billboard, whose headline read: \"Is Morgan Wallen Country's Next Global Star?\"[14] At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Wallen found himself with more time to write and record material, which developed into his sophomore album, the double-disc Dangerous: The Double Album (2021),[27] which showcases a mix of country and R&B/pop balladry.[12] Dangerous was an immediate blockbuster: it debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and the Canadian Albums Chart;[28][29] it would remain atop the Canadian chart for four consecutive weeks, and the US chart for six consecutive weeks, marking the first new album from a country artist to do that since Garth Brooks' The Chase in 1992.[30][31][32][33] Its singles—\"More Than My Hometown\", \"7 Summers\", \"Sand in My Boots\" and \"Wasted on You\"—were record-breaking hit songs that pushed Wallen farther into the national conversation. \"7 Summers\" earned him his first top 10 on the Hot 100, debuting and peaking at number six,[34] and was also chosen by Time as one of the best songs of the year.[35] Wallen soon became the first artist to ever chart six songs within the top 10 of Hot Country Songs chart at the same time in the week after his album's release;[36] likewise, the album charted 23 tracks on the Canadian Hot 100,[37] and 19 tracks on the Hot 100 in the US.[38] On February 2, 2021, TMZ released a video recorded on January 31 showing Wallen using the racial slur \"nigger\" to one of his friends after a night out.[39][40] He issued a statement shortly after and apologized.[41] Several radio stations temporarily removed Wallen's music from airplay on their stations, and his songs were removed from Apple Music, Pandora and Spotify featured playlists.[42][43] CMT and the Country Music Association removed Wallen's appearances from their platforms, and his record label Big Loud (and partner Republic Records) suspended its recording contract with him indefinitely.[44][45] The Academy of Country Music announced that Wallen and the album Dangerous: The Double Album would be ineligible for the 56th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards.[46][47] On February 10, Wallen shot an apology video in which he asked his fans not to defend him.[48] In April 2021, Wallen donated $300,000 to the Black Music Action Coalition in the names of 20 people who had counseled him following the incident. Those individuals were given the option to funnel their respective $15,000 donations to a charity of their choice, or keep the money within the BMAC.[49] Wallen publicly spoke of his comments on Good Morning America on July 23, where he said that \"he was around some of his friends, and they say dumb stuff together\" and said that \"he was wrong\" to express those words.[50] Wallen's songs returned to country radio in August when his single \"Sand in My Boots\" was released.[51] He was nominated for Favorite Male Country Artist and Favorite Country Album for the 2021 American Music Awards, but was not invited to attend the ceremony, and was consequently unable to accept any awards if he won, which he did not.[52] Though his public image took a hit, Wallen’s popularity increased.[53] In the week following the controversy, album sales of Dangerous surged. In some cases, the physical as well as digital album sales went up over 100% in the week following the controversy.[54] He remained atop the Billboard charts for seven more weeks; If I Know Me even entered the top 10 for the first time.[55] Over the ensuing years, Dangerous remained a juggernaut; Ben Sisario, writing in The New York Times, dubbed it \"an unusually enduring hit\".[56] It has continued to break chart records:[30] it was the best-performing album of 2021,[57] and in 2022, the album broke the record for the most weeks in the top 10 on the Billboard 200 chart among albums by a singular artist, surpassing a goal set a half-century before.[58] Dangerous was awarded Album of the Year at the Academy of Country Music;[59] Wallen also won Favorite Male Artist and Favorite Album at the inaugural Country Now Awards.[60] Wallen has continued to release new music, and has remained a popular draw on the road. The Dangerous Tour of arenas and amphitheaters was completely sold-out.[57][61] His single \"You Proof\" became his second Hot 100 hit and first to reach the top five; both \"You Proof\" and \"Thought You Should Know\" topped the country charts. Wallen also collaborated with rapper Lil Durk on the song \"Broadway Girls\", a top-15 hit on the Hot 100; he also performed the song live with Durk at MLK Freedom Fest in Nashville.[62] Wallen was a co-writer on the Tyler Joe Miller single \"Wild as Her\", released in February 2022, and the Keith Urban single \"Brown Eyes Baby, released in July 2022.[63][64] In December 2022, Wallen released a sampler EP titled One Thing at a Time, featuring three songs he had been working on up until this point, titled \"One Thing at a Time\", \"Tennessee Fan\" and \"Days That End in Why\".[65] In 2023, Wallen expanded to stadiums with his One Night at a Time World Tour.[66] Wallen released his third studio album One Thing at a Time on March 3, 2023.[67] On April 23, 2023, at Vaught–Hemingway Stadium in Oxford, Mississippi, just minutes before he was set to perform, Wallen announced that he could not perform due to losing his voice. Fans were directed to receive refunds at their points of purchase.[68] In May 2023, Wallen was featured on the song \"Stand by Me\" from Lil Durk's eighth studio album, Almost Healed. Wallen was a co-writer on the 2023 single \"Fixer Upper\" by Dallas Smith.[69][70] On January 26, 2024, Panacea Records released a deluxe 10th anniversary edition of Morgan Wallen's 2015 EP Stand Alone that included eight previously unreleased songs. These songs were recorded in the same sessions as the original Stand Alone songs. Before the release of the 10th anniversary album, Wallen released a statement on his Instagram page saying that the release of this album was happening \"against his wishes\".[71] Wallen released \"Spin You Around (1/24)\", an acoustic re-recording of the original, in response to the album's release.[72] On March 3, 2024, he shared performances as part of his Abbey Road Sessions and performed a new song titled \"Lies Lies Lies\".[73] On May 2, 2024, Wallen announced his next single entitled \"I Had Some Help\" with Post Malone, which was released on May 10.[74] In September 2024, Wallen announced his second single from his upcoming fourth studio album, \"Love Somebody\", which was released on October 18.[75] It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[76] Wallen was nominated for seven awards at the 58th Annual Country Music Association Awards, with his only win being the prestigious Entertainer of the Year award. Wallen was not in attendance to accept and the presenter, Jeff Bridges, jokingly accepted on his behalf.[77] In May 2020, Wallen was arrested and charged with public intoxication and disorderly conduct after leaving Kid Rock's bar in Nashville, Tennessee after reportedly kicking glass items inside the bar when he was told to leave, as well as getting into multiple verbal altercations with passersby outside.[78] He turned to Twitter the next day to publicly apologize, writing, \"I went out downtown last night with a few old friends. After a couple bar stops, we were horse-playing with each other. We didn't mean any harm, and we want to say sorry to any bar staff or anyone that was affected. Thank you to the local authorities for being so professional and doing their job with class.\"[79] The case was later settled in a court hearing.[80] In October 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple videos were posted on TikTok showing Wallen ignoring CDC guidelines in bars and other locations in the Tuscaloosa, Alabama, area after attending a University of Alabama football game. Wallen was shown partying maskless, not following social distancing guidelines, and kissing several women in these videos. Wallen was criticized for his conduct, partly as his ex-girlfriend had recently given birth. As a result of his actions, Wallen was cancelled as the musical guest on that week's episode of Saturday Night Live; he ultimately performed in an episode two months later hosted by actor Jason Bateman, in which Bateman, Wallen, and several cast members parody the incident and resulting fallout.[81][82][83][84] On April 7, 2024, Wallen was arrested after allegedly throwing a chair off the roof of Eric Church's newly-opened bar on Broadway in Nashville, Chief's. He was charged with three counts of felony reckless endangerment and one count of misdemeanor disorderly conduct after the projectile landed near two police officers on the ground.[85] Two weeks later, Wallen spoke out about the incident on Twitter, writing, \"I didn't feel right publicly checking in until I made amends with some folks. I've touched base with Nashville law enforcement, my family, and the good people at Chief's. I'm not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility. I have the utmost respect for the officers working every day to keep us all safe.\"[86] In December 2024, Wallen pled guilty to two misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment, with the other two charges being dismissed, and was sentenced to serve seven days in a DUI education center, and two consecutive years of supervised probation.[87] In 2016, Wallen began a relationship with influencer KT Smith, and the couple got engaged several months later.[88][89] In 2019, they separated, allegedly due to Wallen's infidelity, and welcomed a son, Indigo (b. 2020), together several months after their breakup.[90][91][89] Smith is now married to another man.[89] Wallen has also been romantically linked with influencer Paige Lorenze,[92] and fellow country singer Megan Moroney, who allegedly wrote her breakout song \"Tennessee Orange\" about him.[93][94][95] On June 1, 2024, Wallen opened Morgan Wallen's This Bar & Tennessee Kitchen, a six-story bar, restaurant and music venue, in downtown Nashville.[96] Headlining Opening",

                "content": "CD Projekt RED has revealed its next single-player, open-world RPG to the world and we are very much freaking out When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Witcher 4 is inching ever closer. CD Projekt RED just revealed its next open-world RPG, the first installment in a new Witcher saga that's set to star Ciri as she begins her journey as a monster hunter on the Continent. A gorgeous Unreal Engine 5 cinematic trailer showcased the look, feel, and vibe of the world CDPR is striving to create in its new Witcher game, a sprawling single-player epic that is charting a future for the franchise without Geralt at the helm. As something ends, something begins – the studio striving to deliver \"the most immersive and ambitious open-world Witcher game to date.\" With no Witcher 4 release date in sight, there's a chance we will be waiting for years for new updates – CDPR is known to take its time and only gradually tease out information. So what you'll find below is all of the latest The Witcher 4 news, including the first details on the world and story and the reason for Ciri taking the lead. Here's what I will say: The Witcher 4 is instantly one of the most anticipated upcoming video games on the calendar, and one that is striving to upend the standards set by the best RPGs. So keep on reading to find everything we know so far about The Witcher 4. CD Project RED is yet to confirm any launch details for its new open-world RPG. That means that there's no Witcher 4 release date, and no sense of what platforms it will land on just yet. In fact, the studio hasn't even committed to a rough release window after its showing at The Game Awards 2024 – there's basically zero chance of this title landing in 2025, and 2026 also seems unlikely given that it only entered its \"full-scale production phase\" earlier this year. We're going to be waiting a while for this one, folks. The Witcher 4 gameplay experience is going to be familiar if you played The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, with some notable differences. While you'll be returning to the Continent, CDPR is shooting for a more brutal dark-fantasy world, with Ciri taking the lead as she tries to walk the witcher's path as the old world crumbles around her. The studio has already confirmed that The Witcher 4 will be a single-player RPG set in an open-world, albeit one where you have more scope to make choices and live with the consequences. Ciri is a very different character to Geralt, more open to embracing the world around her – part of her struggle in this new adventure will be not only in grappling with ancient nightmares, but the evil which lurks in the people struggling to survive this land. Still, at the heart of it all is the witcher – a mutated warrior skilled in combat and alchemy, slaying monsters which threaten people for a price; only now you'll be able to do it with new combat proficiencies, all of it enhanced with Ciri's ability to deftly wield magic. In The Witcher 4 you take control of Ciri, not a seasoned veteran but a character just starting down the witcher's path. That'll be reflected in combat encounters in The Witcher 4, where Ciri may not always start with the upper hand in encounters but always have the capacity to gain the upper hand by striking at the opportune moment. You can get a sense of this from the first Witcher 4 trailer, particularly in how the character wields magic (something not typically seen in other witchers out there in the wilds). If you watch the cinematic back closely you'll notice that Ciri is able to seamlessly integrate her abilities into combat, imbuing her with more range, options, and vulnerabilities – CDPR says that this will be at the heart of The Witcher 4 combat experience. CD Projekt RED is yet to reveal the full extent of The Witcher 4 story, but it has framed the new adventure nicely. In this single-player, open-world RPG you will take control of Ciri as the beginning of her monster-slaying career – just as she starts her journey down the witcher's path. \"We're kicking off a brand new Witcher saga, this time with Ciri as the heart of the story,\" says Sebastian Kalemba, game director. \"For the longest time we knew that we wanted Ciri to be the protagonist of The Witcher 4; it just felt natural to us and we believe that Ciri deserves it. In this game we want to explore what it means to truly become a witcher by following Ciri on her Path.\" Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Executive producer Malgorzata Mitrega explains that Ciri being so distinct from Geralt also opens up new storytelling possibilities. \"She’s open, curious, and drawn to people, yearning for connection and understanding. This opens up uncharted territory in storytelling, where relationships and emotions are just as important as the fight for survival.\" You get a sense of all of this in the first Witcher 4 trailer, which sees Ciri completing a witcher's contract near the village of Stromford – not only battling an ancient evil in the shadows but encountering evil in a more human form too, where her decision to intervene in old rituals leads to disastrous consequences. Ciri is the main character in The Witcher 4. Geralt's adopted daughter played a pivotal role in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and now that his story has reached its conclusion it's time for a new Witcher to leave their mark on the Continent. CD Projekt RED is keen to note the differences between the two characters, with story director Tomasz Marchewka explaining: \"On one hand, she’s very similar to Geralt, a continuator of his values – honorable, brave, just, but she also has this side we haven’t explored much – grim, rebellious, and fierce. She’s familiar, but at the same time she’s fresh. And she’s simply a badass.\" The studio says that there was never any doubt that Ciri would become the protagonist of The Witcher franchise. Marchewka says that \"from the very beginning we knew it had to be Ciri – she's a very complex character, and there is so much to be told about here.\" Executive producer Malgorzata Mitrega adds: \"Ciri is a worthy successor to the title of the next Witcher, and personally for me she always has been!\" The Witcher 4 is going to be a single-player open-world RPG. Developer CD Projekt RED believes it'll be the \"most immersive and ambitious open-world Witcher game to date.\" With a new protagonist comes a new open-world to explore, and the studio is already teasing out a far darker fantasy world. You should expect The Witcher 4 to offer up a world that is more dangerous and unpredictable than the one we experienced alongside Geralt, \"a world where the old order is crumbling, and dark forces are seizing their chance to rise.\" The studio adds: \"In this world, survival depends not only on your skills in combat, but also on the connections you make with those around you, for better or worse.\" Expanding on this darker open-world concept, narrative director Philipp Weber says that: \"The world of The Witcher 4 is a place full of moral ambiguity, and so the stories we tell there rarely provide easy answers of good and evil. Make your choices, and live with the consequences. Ciri's story is a battle against destiny. This battle comes at a price that will have to be paid eventually – either by Ciri, or by those dear to her. Your actions within the open world, the people you permit to come close to you, all have the potential to affect the path Ciri goes down on, and who she will become.\" CD Project RED is using Unreal Engine 5 to develop The Witcher 4. The studio spoke back in 2022 about its decision to shift away from the REDengine – which was used for The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 – but The Game Awards 2024 was our first opportunity to see the new vision for the series in action. The results are spellbinding, although it should be noted that The Witcher 4 cinematic trailer is not rendered in real-time, but rather has been powered by the same technology powering the game to give you a sense of what the final product may look like. CDPR has confirmed that the debut trailer uses assets and models from the game itself and \"represents a look that we're targeting.\" While The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt had a number of ending variations, it's possible to now get a better sense of the canon ending for the Geralt series now that we know Ciri is walking the witcher's path. In The Witcher 3 the three core ending scenarios involved: Ciri becoming a witcher, becoming the Empress, or dying. We know that the third option is out of the picture, which is also the scenario which implied that Geralt dies in combat. So instead we're likely looking at a world in which Geralt is still active in the Continent during The Witcher 4, albeit in a reduced capacity – his monster slaying days behind him as he grows older and wearier. Some of the ending variations in The Witcher 3 did, after all, have Geralt retiring in Kovir with Triss or eloping with Yennefer. So who knows, maybe we'll see some old, friendly faces.

                "content": "“Since I can remember, we've been talking about Ciri and how much she deserves her own journey,” says Sebastian Kalemba, game director of The Witcher 4. This likely won’t come as a surprise to many fans of CD Projekt Red’s beloved RPG series. Ever since the Polish developer announced “Polaris”, The Witcher 4’s codename, people have theorised that the series would switch perspective from the iconic Geralt of Rivia to his adoptive daughter, Ciri. She is, after all, effectively the secondary protagonist of both the original novels and The Witcher 3. “I think ‘The Witcher’ as a title refers to both Geralt and Ciri and always has,” explains Cian Maher, franchise and lore designer at CDPR. “I think she's arguably more important to the plot than Geralt himself is.” Last we saw Ciri she was a young woman facing her destiny. But now, as depicted in a new cinematic trailer shown at The Game Awards 2024, Ciri is a fully-fledged witcher hunting monsters for profit. Kalemba explains that, following the events of The Witcher 3, Ciri has undertaken the famously painful Trial of the Grasses which has mutated her into a powerful and resilient warrior. She’s ready to take on a whole new journey in The Witcher 4, which is the first part of a planned new trilogy of single-player, open-world RPGs. “I love this grit in her,” Kalemba says. “She's almost obsessed with the way she lives. There are some moments where you have to go with your heart instead of always going with the calculated calls. And this is what I love in Ciri. She's less calculating, following her heart, her passion, her gut feel.” It’s this passion that will differentiate Ciri from Geralt, and subsequently The Witcher 4 from its predecessors. “We want to let players try to define her,” says Kalemba. Unlike Geralt, who has been a veteran monster hunter for the entire Witcher saga, Ciri is only just starting her career. That means there’s space for players to create their own version of her. “She's about to form her own codex on her own terms,” Kalemba reveals. “The way she actually deals with the monsters, the way she deals with quests, the adventures, it's her own unique way.” As any veteran of CD Projekt Red’s RPGs will know, the shape of Ciri and her codex will be dictated by decisions, both big and small. We see an example of such during the trailer, in which Ciri’s interruption of a dark ritual results in the death of a girl she is attempting to save. It’s a classic example of the studio’s signature approach to choice and unforeseen consequences, but Kalemba promises a deeper approach for this fourth chapter. “We want to put player agency at the center,” he says. Achieving such has required an expansion and evolution of The Witcher’s definition of player choice. “[We’re giving] more tools for players' disposal, to be able to not only play and go with the consequences narratively, but also gameplay-wise,” explains Kalemba. “We want to give players more opportunities to be able to feel that they define their experience.” While The Witcher 3 is quite rightly considered among the very best RPGs of the 21st century, its admirable complexity is very much in its narrative design rather than elastic gameplay. For example, Geralt can’t become a master of stealth and silently backstab his way to victory, nor can he hone his skills in niche polearms to develop a particular fighting style. But in the years between Witcher projects CDPR created Cyberpunk 2077, an RPG with much, much greater flexibility when it comes to those kinds of choices. “I believe the gameplay [in Cyberpunk 2077] was more varied [than that in The Witcher 3] and it allowed more freedom when it comes to creating character builds and being able to experience encounters in your own way,” Kalemba explains. Every encounter in 2077’s Night City is a flowchart of decisions: Action or stealth? Hacking or weapons? Ranged or melee? Those options are expanded and enhanced by the skills and perks you’ve invested in (as well as a healthy dose of curiosity and experimentation). And so for Ciri’s next adventure, the studio is looking to not just build upon what it achieved in The Witcher 3, but also Cyberpunk 2077 and its expansion, Phantom Liberty. “This is something we definitely want to bring as a lesson [to The Witcher 4],” asserts Kalemba. “We want to improve on [The Witcher 3’s] gameplay but also we want to improve the alignment of the way you will be able to explore the world.” He hopes that such improvements will result in a “super coherent experience” across main story missions, side quests, and open-world activities. CD Projekt Red definitely has the ‘bigger, better, more advanced’ aspect of a AAA sequel underway, then. But sequels are also about continuing the story, and while The Witcher 4 is the start of a new saga, it’s still the next chapter in an established character’s life. And that’s where there’s a little problem to overcome. “The one complication is probably the idea that there is an ending in which Ciri can die in The Witcher 3,” explains Maher. Thankfully that ending, which is one of three different fates for Ciri and the outcome of several hidden choices made throughout the game, isn’t quite as clear cut as it may seem. “There are hints in that ending that highlight the fact that she probably does not die,” says Maher. And so regardless of the events you personally witnessed at the end of your own Witcher 3 playthrough, the sequel will not “break any canon or even offend any canon.” Of course, there will be plenty of players coming to The Witcher 4 who have no knowledge of the events of the previous games, to whom the details of Ciri’s former adventures will mean little. CD Projekt Red is very aware that it’s been a decade since the release of Wild Hunt, and that a whole generation of fantasy fans who were too young for a mature-rated RPG back in 2015 will likely start their Witcher journey with the fourth game when it finally launches. “We want to aim for the new players,” says Małgorzata Mitręga, executive producer of The Witcher 4. “The wider audience, and also the people that know the franchise but who maybe do not play our games.” As such, The Witcher 4 is being pitched as the start of something new as much as it is the continuation of something old. As part of that, Kalemba and Mitręga explain that they’re ensuring The Witcher 4 is an approachable experience. They want “everyone who cares” to play. But there doesn’t seem to be any sign of the studio’s trademark RPG depth being watered down in payment for that approachability. “We create story-driven games, so we want to make sure that people that buy games for story, they'll be able to experience the story in their own way and they will be simply able to approach it,” Kalemba explains. “But people that are looking for specific challenges, they will also be able to experience the story in a challenging way.” The big reveal that Ciri will be the protagonist of The Witcher 4 was one of the biggest and best surprises at The Game Awards 2024, but that's just the start. CD Projekt Red invited IGN to join the development team at its studio in Warsaw, Poland to talk in-depth about its plans for the future of The Witcher. To learn everything we discovered, check out our exclusive coverage: The studio faces a much larger challenge than just crafting a sequel that’s approachable for newcomers, though. While Cyberpunk 2077 is now regarded as a landmark RPG, its launch was one of the highest-profile disasters in industry history. It took CD Projekt Red years to fix the game’s problems, a project necessary not only to make the game work, but also to save the company’s reputation. Those years were more than just transformative for Cyberpunk, though; the road to 2077’s notable comeback resulted in significant structural changes at CDPR. Changes that hopefully lay the groundwork for better things for The Witcher 4. “The way we produce right now has changed in a very good way,” says Kalemba. “We are very mindfully defining the stages of the production. We are very mindfully trying to scope it, making sure that the foundation is there. I already see that it’s helping us to make sure that whatever we create right now is super coherent across the board. This way makes us feel that we control this super complex environment more than we used to, and that also makes everyone feel more secure when it comes to developing generally on a daily basis.” The governing rule among these new changes is “let it cook.” That’s evident in the way the studio has allowed more time for pre-production – The Witcher 4’s existence was publicly announced back in October 2022, but it has only just gone into full production. But there have been other significant changes. During the development of Phantom Liberty, for example, the studio was restructured into “content teams” where multiple disciplines work together in tightly co-ordinated groups to create particular sequences and quests. These changes aren’t just about ensuring game quality and a smooth eventual release, though. During the development of Cyberpunk 2077 it was reported that studio staff endured long working hours and mandatory overtime demands. Rewind the clock further back and CDPR faced similar accusations while working on The Witcher 3. The studio’s new approach aims to create a better working environment for the people making The Witcher 4. “I think that it's already helping [create a better working environment],” says Mitręga. “I guess that the way [forward is] to produce it in a healthy manner so that people still can find fun in what they do. And that's what is inspiring, that's what makes the quality so high. “We are planning different ways we communicate with the teams,” she continues. “Teams are planned differently than we were [on Cyberpunk 2077], so it's already helping.” CD Projekt Red isn’t ready to reveal a launch date for The Witcher 4 yet, possibly as a result of that “let it cook” mantra. But, if the cinematic trailer is anything to go by, the recipe will have to be exact. While IGN visited the studio’s Warsaw HQ ahead of The Game Awards, the team explained that the trailer had gone through dozens and dozens of revisions, with each new version fine-tuning the presentation and delivery of The Witcher 4’s first story. CD Projekt Red has approached this cinematic with as much precision as it has the game at large, iterating over and over again until it’s exactly right. “Believe me, behind every single scene there was an intention,” says Kalemba. “There is, in any single frame, no coincidence in this trailer. We were building it in a way to sell a very, very coherent short story with a beginning and climax.” “We also wanted to have the full experience,” adds Mitręga. “Because this is coming home for the old [fans], but this is also an introduction for the new audience.” After a decade of waiting, nothing but a full experience would do for those old fans. And that’s what we have; the six-minute trailer tells not just a complete short story, but also contains all the hallmarks of a classic Witcher quest: a contract, a kill, and a consequence. For veterans of Geralt’s adventures, it's a good reminder of why it’s worth coming back for a fourth installment. As for new fans, it’s about as good a taste of The Witcher’s magic as you can get in advertisement form. No doubt The Witcher subreddit is about to be inundated with a thousand “how do I get into this?” posts (and if that is a question you have, then our chat with CD Projekt Red’s Witcher loremasters should be your next stop.) As for what’s next, CD Projekt Red won’t say. With full production only just spun up, we could be in for another long wait until the next details about Ciri’s new adventure are ready to be shared. But what little the team was willing to share is already something to chew on with anticipation. The expectations around RPGs have shifted a lot since The Witcher 3 launched in 2015. Games like Baldur’s Gate 3 and CDPR’s own Cyberpunk 2077 have put deep emphasis on worlds that react, respond, bend, and break under the pressures inflicted by players. How The Witcher 4 will play with those expectations remains to be seen, but CDPR’s promise of a Ciri that can be defined by those who play as her is as good a place as any to start.

From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently. The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room – with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter’s cases. No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son – and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter – who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me – and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough. For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further.

The amnesty will be extended to roughly 1,500 people who were placed on home confinement during the COVID pandemic and 39 others who were convicted of nonviolent crimes, especially drug crimes, who have \"shown successful rehabilitation,\" according to a White House press release. Biden said in the statement he would \"take more steps in the weeks ahead\" and continue to review clemency petitions to advance \"equal justice under the law, promote public safety, support rehabilitation and reentry, and provide meaningful second chances.\" The White House said the pardoned individuals include a decorated military veteran, a nurse who helped spearhead vaccination efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic and an addiction counselor who volunteers to help young people. The actions come less than two weeks after Biden pardoned his son, Hunter, for gun and tax felonies, igniting bipartisan backlash. Pardons, explained: What is a presidential pardon?

                "content": "White House says move marks largest act of clemency in a single day in modern US history. United States President Joe Biden has commuted nearly 1,500 prison sentences and pardoned 39 people in what the White House has described as the largest act of clemency in a single day in the country’s modern history. In a statement on Thursday, Biden said he chose to pardon 39 people “who have shown successful rehabilitation” as well as a “commitment to making their communities stronger and safer”. “I am also commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 people who are serving long prison sentences – many of whom would receive lower sentences if charged under today’s laws, policies, and practices,” he said. The commutations were for people who were placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House said. Thursday’s announcement came less than two weeks after Biden pardoned his son Hunter for firearms and tax convictions after pledging that he wouldn’t do so. Republicans seized on that decision, attacking the Democratic president for using his power to shield a family member from legal judgements. They accused Biden of enforcing a separate standard of justice for those with political connections. The Biden administration rejected those allegations, saying Hunter Biden’s prosecution was political in nature. The pardon spurred renewed calls for President Biden, who will leave office in January when President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated, to pardon and commute the sentences of thousands of people who have submitted clemency petitions. “Before you leave the White House, you must act on your words that ‘America is a nation founded on the promise of second chances’ by prioritizing an ambitious clemency initiative that pardons or commutes the sentences of the approximately 10,000 pending clemency petitions,” dozens of progressive groups wrote in an open letter to Biden last week. They called on Biden to use his clemency powers “in a broad sweep of categories of people and cases”, including the elderly and chronically ill, people on death row and those first incarcerated as minors. “We urge you to take immediate action so that you may leave a more meaningful legacy than the current numbers reflect,” the organisations said. Those pardoned on Thursday had been convicted of nonviolent crimes such as drug offences and turned their lives around, the White House said. They include a woman who led emergency response teams during natural disasters, a church deacon who has worked as an addiction counsellor and youth counsellor, a doctoral student in molecular biosciences and a decorated military veteran. In Thursday’s statement, Biden said he would “take more steps in the weeks ahead” and continue to review clemency petitions. The president had previously issued 122 commutations and 21 other pardons. He has also broadly pardoned those convicted of use and simple possession of marijuana on federal lands and in the District of Columbia and pardoned former US service members convicted of violating a now-repealed military ban on consensual gay sex.

                "content": "Isaac Guerendo (born June 28, 2000)[1] is an American professional football running back for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Wisconsin Badgers and Louisville Cardinals. Guerendo was born in Clayton, Indiana[2][3] and attended Avon High School in Avon, Indiana. In his junior season, Guerendo hauled in 19 receptions for 596 yards and six touchdowns.[4] Guerendo had a breakout senior season bringing in 54 receptions for 1,258 yards and 16 touchdowns.[5] As a senior, Guerendo was named the Indianapolis Star's Mister Football for wide receivers.[6][5] Coming out of high school, Guerendo decided to commit to play college football for the Wisconsin Badgers.[7][8] In Guerendo's first season in 2019, he carried the ball once for one yard, while also making one catch for three yards, and returning one kickoff for 49 yards.[9] In the COVID shortened 2020 season, Guerendo carried the ball 11 times for 36 yards.[10] In week two of the 2021 season, he recorded his first career touchdown on an 82-yard run versus Eastern Michigan.[11] Guerendo finished the 2021 season with 160 yards and a touchdown of 23 carries, while also racking up two receptions for six yards.[12] In 2022 he rushed for 385 yards and five touchdowns on 64 carries, while also notching 17 receptions for 115 yards and a touchdown.[13] After the conclusion of the 2022 season, Guerendo decided to enter the NCAA transfer portal.[14][15] Guerendo finished his Wisconsin Badger career playing in 20 games carrying the ball 99 times for 582 yards and six touchdowns, while also notching 20 receptions for 124 yards and a touchdown.[16] He graduated from Wisconsin in December 2022 with a bachelor's degree in personal finance.[17] In 2023, Guerendo became a graduate transfer to the University of Louisville, playing for the Louisville Cardinals for his final season of college eligibility.[18][19] In Guerendo's Louisville home debut in week two of the 2023 season, he rushed for 63 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries, while also hauling in four receptions for 47 yards.[20] In week ten of the 2023 season, Guerendo had a career performance rushing for 146 yards and three touchdowns in a win over Virginia Tech.[21] In the 2023 Holiday Bowl, Guerendo rushed for a career high 161 yards and three touchdowns, on 23 carries, but the Cardinals lost to USC 42–28.[22] Guerendo finished the 2023 season with 810 yards and 11 touchdowns on 132 carries, while also making 22 receptions for 234 yards.[23] After the conclusion of the 2023 season, Guerendo declared for the 2024 NFL draft.[24][25] Guerendo was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the 4th round (129th overall) of the 2024 NFL Draft.[28] In May, he signed a 4 year contract with the 49ers.[29] After injuries to running backs Christian McCaffrey and Jordan Mason,[30] he had some playing time, making his debut in week 2 against the Minnesota Vikings in a 23–17 loss.

Nearly every notable name on the offense has missed time at some point this season. The two most significant injuries were Brandon Aiyuk and Christian McCaffrey, who combined to appear in just 11 games and did not share the field for a single snap all year. The position group that has been hit the hardest has undoubtedly been running back. Starter Christian McCaffrey (knee) is amid his second IR stint, and his backup, Jordan Mason, is also on IR with a high-ankle sprain. With their top two options sidelined, the expectation was that rookie Isaac Guerendo would lead the backfield for the remainder of the regular season. Well, Guerendo suffered an injury of his own last week and is in danger of missing a Thursday night matchup with the Rams. WEEK 15 FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGSQBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/ST | Kickers After spraining his foot last week, Guerendo has been labeled as day-to-day. After not practicing to open the week, he was upgraded to limited participation during Wednesday's practice. Following his spotty participation, the team has listed Gurendo as \"questionable\" for Thursday's game. 49ers ruled out LT Trent Williams (ankle) and S Malik Mustapha (chest, shoulder) for Thursday night’s game vs. the Rams.DE Nick Bosa (hip, oblique), RB Isaac Guerendo (foot) and LB Dre Greenlaw (Achilles) are listed as questionable. Considering Guerendo has not practiced in full at any point this week, it's truly a toss-up as to whether he'll be able to suit up. There's a decent chance his status is unknown until inactives are due 90 minutes before kickoff. Guerendo continues to maintain that he is going to play. He has been listed as questionable and will test his injury during pre-game warm-ups, but the notion in the morning is that the running back will play. With the fantasy football playoffs starting tonight:49ers rookie RB Isaac Guerendo plans to play Thursday night vs. the Rams despite his sprained foot that has left him being listed as questionable, per sources. Guerendo insists he “feels good.” pic.twitter.com/WClJ52lva3 Check back here often, as we'll be providing updates on Guerendo's status as they become available. Considering Guerendo is the RB3 in San Francisco, they'll be reaching deep down the depth chart if he's unable to play. When Guerendo left late in the game last week, the coaching staff turned to Patrick Taylor to close out the game. He'd likely function as the lead back in Guerendo's absence. If Guerendo is unable to play, don't be surprised if one (or both) of Ke'Shawn Vaughn or Israel Abanikanda mix in with Taylor to some degree. Both are relatively new to the team, but they could be used to spell Taylor throughout the game. Week 15 FANTASY FOOTBALL ROSTER MANAGEMENTLessons Learned | Stock Watch | Sleepers | Busts | Start 'Em, Sit 'Em | Usage Report Gurendo acted as a bell cow last week, ceding just one carry to Patrick Taylor before getting hurt, and he was incredibly effective in this role. Unsurprisingly, a running back with size (6-0, 221 pounds) and speed (4.33 40-yard dash) performed well in Kyle Shanahan's offense. The rookie finished with 26.8 PPR points on 17 touches and was set up to be a true league winner. Assuming Guerendo is able to play, he may be limited in some capacity, but he's well worth the start. His fantasy value as the 49ers' lead back was cemented last week. Otherwise, Patrick Taylor becomes a terrific spot start if Guerendo can't take the field. If you didn't pick up Taylor on waivers, be sure to consult the Sporting News' RB rankings and sleepers to find a worthwhile replacement for Guerendo.

                "content": "Good news for the 49ers. Rookie running back Isaac Guerendo is expected to play through a foot sprain tonight against the Los Angeles Rams, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Guerendo is the 49ers' third starting running back of the season -- Christian McCaffrey and Jordan Mason both are on Injured Reserve. So the 49ers need Guerendo tonight to have any chance to win. Guerendo made his first career start last week against the Bears, and had 128 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns. He was terrific, both as a runner and as a receiver. But in the fourth quarter when the 49ers were up big, Mason sprained his foot, left the game and did not return. That was just a few days ago. Now, Guerendo says his foot is \"fine.\" What else is he supposed to say? The 49ers' season is on the line tonight and they need him to play even if he's not 100 percent healthy, which he probably isn't. So he's playing. But can he cut on his sprained foot? Is he still as fast as he usually is? We'll find out. His backup will be Patrick Taylor Jr., is a tough, solid inside runner, but he's not the home run threat or the receiver Guerendo is. Another option is Deebo Samuel, who was a good running back in the past. This season, he's averaging just 2.9 yards per carry, which means he has become one of the worst running backs in the league. The less the 49ers have to play him at running back, the better. Download and follow The Cohn Zohn Podcast. Grant Cohn has covered the San Francisco 49ers daily since 2011.

                "title": "Why tailback Isaac Guerendo is so enticing to the 49ers - The Athletic",
                "content": "NFL SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Some kids are just born to run. Isaac Guerendo’s mother, Jen, realized that early on. She remembers a family gathering at a park in southern Indiana during which the kids had a big race. Isaac was 5 or 6 at the time. His two cousins were roughly twice his age. It was a case of ready … set … gone! Advertisement “He blew past both of those boys,” she recalled. “And my sister was like, ‘What in the heck!’ Isaac was just so much faster than everyone else even at that young age.” That speed has been grabbing attention ever since. It’s what attracted the coaches at the University of Wisconsin, who watched Guerendo, then a high school junior, zip through one of Indiana’s powerhouses for touchdown catches of 66 and 77 yards in the state playoffs. “He was out there playing wide receiver, running jet sweeps, returning kickoffs,” said Bob Bostad, the former Wisconsin assistant who recruited Guerendo. “And when you’re doing things like that, the coach is thinking: We’ve just got to get the ball in his hands.” The speed also caught the attention of Bobby Turner. The San Francisco 49ers running backs coach always is seeking velocity in his backfield. It’s why the 49ers brought in burners like Matt Breida, Jerick McKinnon and Tevin Coleman in recent seasons. GO DEEPER 49ers’ Tariq Ahmad on Ricky Pearsall, Isaac Guerendo and the entire draft class Guerendo’s speed rivals that of the fastest of the team’s recent runners, Raheem Mostert, who was so smooth during the 2019 playoffs that opponents couldn’t gauge how quickly he was moving until he’d blown by him. “They’re very close,” Turner said. “Raheem was just a blink faster.” Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Sign up Free, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox. Sign up Growing up just outside of Indianapolis, a lot of people assumed Guerendo was Hispanic. “It might be because Guerendo is so similar to Guerrero,” he said. Telemarketers called the house speaking Spanish. Jen said Isaac and his older sister did some modeling for advertisements and commercials when they were children. Isaac, for example, landed on a billboard for a children’s hospital in Ohio and was the face on Boy Scouts of America popcorn tins. “Both of my kids got cast with Hispanic families more than they did White or Black,” she said. Her kids did grow up understanding two languages, but the second language was French. Their father, Mario, was born in the Central African Republic, a former French colony in the heart of the African continent. He moved to France when he was a little boy, then emigrated to the United States in 1996 to study engineering at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. Advertisement That’s where he met Jen, a former high school hurdler and self-described sports mom. She quickly realized Isaac was gifted athletically and enrolled him with USA Track & Field when he was in the second grade. By the time he was 17, he was soaring nearly 25 feet in the long jump and running 10.51 seconds in the 100-meter dash. Colleges were interested in him as a track athlete and Jen wonders whether he would have been heading to Paris, where he has family, for the Summer Olympics if he had stuck with track. Football, however, emerged as his true love and his speed made him a natural fit at receiver. He averaged a gaudy 23.3 yards a catch as a high school senior and was named Indiana’s Mr. Football at receiver at the end of the season. He ran like a track athlete — with a fluidity that fooled defenders the way Mostert used to for the 49ers. “People don’t realize he’s as fast as he is,” Jen said. “So they might take a wrong angle. And if that happens, he’s gone. There’s no catching him. I have never seen anybody catch him. Ever.” When Guerendo arrived at Wisconsin the following year, the coaches didn’t see a wideout. He was already more than 200 pounds with room for more mass. “He has a specific type of body style,” Jen said. “I hate to say it like this because it sounds weird, but he has a really big butt.” GO DEEPER A 'high butt factor' might be an NFL Draft prospect's most prized asset The Wisconsin coaches noticed the same thing. They knew they wanted to get the ball in Guerendo’s hands, realized that would be difficult in their run-first attack and approached him during his redshirt season to see what he thought about making the switch. They sweetened the proposal by saying he reminded them of their lead tailback at the time, Jonathan Taylor. Guerendo liked the sound of that and spent his first two college seasons learning from Taylor. “They would go back and forth in practice,” John Settle, then Wisconsin’s running backs coach, recalled. “If Isaac hit 22 mph, then JT would run 22.1, 22.2 the next day. And then Isaac the next day would run 22.3. It was great competition. They embraced challenging each other.” The comparison to Taylor makes sense. Taylor was 226 pounds when he was drafted in 2020. Guerendo was 221 pounds at the NFL Scouting Combine. Taylor ran his 40-yard dash in 4.39 seconds four years ago. Guerendo was a few ticks faster, finishing in 4.33 seconds in February. Guerendo ran a 4.33-second 40 today. He's a one-cut-and-go guy who'd be a good fit in a zone-blocking scheme. He also has background as a receiver. (Basically, I'm saying that if Shanahan drafts another RB in the third run, this will be the guy). https://t.co/6UhV8O4GQZ — Matt Barrows (@mattbarrows) March 2, 2024 But while Taylor twice surpassed 2,000 rushing yards in a single season at Wisconsin and became a second-round pick to the Indianapolis Colts, Guerendo never started a game for the Badgers. It turned out he was too fast for his hamstrings. Bad strains hampered his 2019 and 2020 seasons and a foot injury caused him to miss nine games in 2021. He was healthy in 2022, but by then he’d fallen behind Braelon Allen, who started every game for the Badgers that season. Guerendo and the 49ers believe his injury-marked seasons came with two silver linings. One is that he figured out how to take care of his hamstrings. A lot of NFL players don’t learn how to truly maintain their bodies until a couple of years into their careers. Guerendo had to learn to be a professional while he was still in college. He became meticulous about his diet and his pre- and post-practice routines. He spent hours on a foam roller, was a mainstay in the hot and cold tubs, got massages and cupping therapy. The result was that he didn’t miss any games in his final two college seasons. Advertisement The 49ers also note that Guerendo’s limited usage means he’s entering the NFL without a lot of wear and tear, and the team is hoping it’s snagged Guerendo on the edge of his ascent. His final college season, which he spent at Louisville, was by far his most productive. And the second half of that season was better than the first. Eight of his 11 touchdowns came in the final seven games and his 4.5-yards per carry average over the first half of the season jumped to 7 yards a carry over the second. His 161 rushing yards versus USC in the Holiday Bowl, which was Guerendo’s final college game, was a career high. Settle, who is now the running backs coach at Rice, watched the Louisville-USC game. When he was at Wisconsin, Guerendo tended to rely on his impressive speed. Settle was pleased to see his former pupil also use his bulk versus the Trojans. He had 90 yards after contact, three carries of 15 yards or more and caught all five pass targets for 42 yards. “I was able to watch that game and he actually showed some power in his game,” Settle said. “And I was like, ‘Wow, OK. That’s new. That’s different.’ He was able to give you both — to break through the arm tackles and still have that ability that once he gets a step on you, look out!” It’s also worth noting that two of the runners Guerendo played behind in college were drafted after him in April. Wisconsin’s Allen went to the New York Jets at pick No. 134 in the fourth round, five spots after the 49ers took Guerendo. Louisville’s Jawhar Jordan was a sixth-round pick to the Houston Texans. Guerendo’s lone college start — against USC — came because Jordan opted out of the bowl game. When training camp begins next month, Guerendo will be behind veterans Christian McCaffrey, Elijah Mitchell and Jordan Mason on the depth chart. And he’ll get stiff competition from undrafted rookie Cody Schrader, who played in a 49ers-like running attack at Missouri. Guerendo’s best chance to make an impact as a rookie may be as a kick returner, which he handled at Wisconsin and Louisville. GO DEEPER 49ers rookie Cody Schrader starts from the bottom again Still, his upside is considerable and the comparison to Mostert seems fitting. The current Miami Dolphins tailback also was a track star who arrived at Purdue as a wide receiver. And more to the point, it took him a while — a long while — to convert his raw speed into NFL stardom. He arrived in San Francisco in 2016 but didn’t start his first game at running back until the 2020 season. And before that he was rejected by six different NFL teams in two seasons. “Just like we had to do with Raheem, we’ve got to get (Guerendo) to see what we want,” Turner said. “Get him to know what we want. And then he’ll get a feel for it and the light comes on. And, bam, the rest is a win for us.” (Top photo: Thearon W. Henderson / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.

December's full Cold Moon will rise overnight on Saturday (Dec. 14) and remain in the sky all night until setting with the sunrise on Sunday (Dec. 15). The full moon will rise in the Taurus constellation, just along the Bull's horns close to the neighboring Auriga constellation, the Charioteer. Close by will be a bright Jupiter. The December full moon also coincides with the peak of the Geminid meteor shower, which should be most active on the night of Dec. 13. The moon might make it difficult to see all but the brightest meteors, but skywatchers should be able to see a few \"shooting stars\" with a bit of patience and some warm clothing. Want to see the features of the moon up close? The Celestron NexStar 4SE is ideal for beginners wanting quality, reliable and quick views of celestial objects. For a more in-depth look at our Celestron NexStar 4SE review. The exact moment of the December full moon occurs at 4:02 a.m. EST (0902 GMT) on Sunday morning, Dec. 15. But even as early as Friday night (Dec. 13), the moon will be 97.9% illuminated, according to Timeanddate, making it appear fairly full to most observers. For two days after the full moon, the moon will remain over 90% illuminated, although the moon will rise later and later each day. Aside from Jupiter, December's full moon will also share the sky with a bright Venus, shining in the southwest as an \"evening star\" before setting a few hours after sunset. Saturn will also be prominent, residing high in the sky in the Aquarius constellation for several hours after the moon rises. Mars will rise a few hours after the moon, just above the twins of Gemini. — What is the moon phase today?

                "content": "The phenomenon of a Full Moon arises when our planet, Earth, is precisely sandwiched between the Sun and the Moon. This alignment ensures the entire side of the Moon that faces us gleams under sunlight. Thanks to the Moon’s orbit around Earth, the angle of sunlight hitting the lunar surface and being reflected back to our planet changes. That creates different lunar phases. The next Full Moon in 2024 is at 4:02 a.m. EDT on Sunday, Dec. 15, and is called the Cold Moon. We’ll update this article multiple times each week with the latest moonrise, moonset, Full Moon schedule, and some of what you can see in the sky each week. Here’s the complete list of Full Moons this year and their traditional names. (all times Eastern) The images below show the day-by-day phases of the Moon in December. The Full Moon this month is Sunday, Dec. 15. The following is adapted from Alison Klesman’s The Sky This Week column. Times for sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset are given in local time from 40° N 90° W. The Moon’s illumination is given at 12 P.M. local time from the same location. Friday, December 13The bright gibbous Moon passes 4° north of Uranus at 5 A.M. EST. At that time, the Moon sits in Aries the Ram, while Uranus is just over the border in far western Taurus the Bull. The two set together around 5 A.M. local time. The Geminid meteor shower peaks this morning, though with the bright Moon in the sky, its usual stunning display will be quite muted. After darkness falls this evening, you can still keep an eye out for shower meteors, originating from the radiant near the heads of Gemini the Twins. However, again the bright Moon’s light will interfere, and by evening the Moon is even closer to Gemini, further diminishing prospects. Saturday, December 14The Moon passes 5° north of Jupiter in Taurus at 3 P.M. EST; both are already above the eastern horizon at sunset and stand side by side as they rise, gaining altitude as darkness falls. The Moon is very nearly Full, a phase it will reach early tomorrow morning, but fortunately Jupiter is still at its brightest, so its magnitude –2.8 glow will still cut through the bright moonlight to reach your naked eye. The planet now stands as the middle point in a line drawn between the Moon and Aldebaran, a wonderful sight for all to see in the evening sky. Sunrise: 7:15 A.M.Sunset: 4:35 P.M.Moonrise: 3:53 P.M.Moonset: 6:43 A.M.Moon Phase: Waxing gibbous (99%) Sunday, December 15The last Full Moon of 2024 occurs at 4:02 A.M. EST. December’s Full Moon is also called the Cold Moon, as it occurs when colder temperatures are falling across North America. Sunrise: 7:15 A.M.Sunset: 4:36 P.M.Moonrise: 4:41 P.M.Moonset: 7:54 A.M.Moon Phase: Full Monday, December 16 Sunrise: 7:16 A.M.Sunset: 4:36 P.M.Moonrise: 5:49 P.M.Moonset: 8:53 A.M.Moon Phase: Waning gibbous (97%) Tuesday, December 17 Sunrise: 7:17 A.M.Sunset: 4:36 P.M.Moonrise: 6:59 P.M.Moonset: 9:41 A.M.Moon Phase: Waning gibbous (93%) Wednesday, December 18The Moon passes 0.9° north of Mars at 4 A.M. EST. You can easily catch the pair before sunrise this morning — an hour before local sunrise, they’re 40° high in the west in central Cancer, near the Beehive open cluster (M44). Of course, the waxing gibbous Moon’s bright light will likely wash out the cluster itself, but Mars is glowing at magnitude –0.9 just to the lower right of Moon, quickly brightening as it approaches opposition in about a month. Sunrise: 7:17 A.M.Sunset: 4:37 P.M.Moonrise: 8:09 P.M.Moonset: 10:17 A.M.Moon Phase: Waning gibbous (87%) Thursday, December 19 Sunrise: 7:18 A.M.Sunset: 4:37 P.M.Moonrise: 9:16 P.M.Moonset: 10:47 A.M.Moon Phase: Waning gibbous (79%) Friday, December 20 Sunrise: 7:18 A.M.Sunset: 4:38 P.M.Moonrise: 10:19 P.M.Moonset: 11:11 A.M.Moon Phase: Waning gibbous (70%) Saturday, December 21 Sunrise: 7:19 A.M.Sunset: 4:38 P.M.Moonrise: 11:20 P.M.Moonset: 11:33 A.M.Moon Phase: Waning gibbous (61%) Sunday, December 22Last Quarter Moon occurs this afternoon at 5:18 P.M.

EST. At that time, our satellite will stand 251,335 miles (404,484 kilometers) away. Look south an hour before sunrise and you’ll see the waning crescent Moon just to the upper right of a bright, 1st-magnitude star. This is Spica, Virgo’s alpha star. You may even spot earthshine illuminating the portion of the Moon now in shadow, caused by sunlight bouncing off Earth. It’s a beautiful scene. The Moon passes 0.2° north of Spica at 3 P.M. EST. By the time Virgo rises again — shortly before 2 A.M. local time tomorrow morning — the Moon will have moved on, now more than 7° southeast of Spica. Sunrise: 7:20 A.M.Sunset: 4:40 P.M.Moonrise: 1:19 A.M.Moonset: 12:31 P.M.Moon Phase: Waning crescent (33%) Wednesday, December 25 Sunrise: 7:21 A.M.Sunset: 4:40 P.M.Moonrise: 2:19 A.M.Moonset: 12:53 P.M.Moon Phase: Waning crescent (25%) Thursday, December 26 Sunrise: 7:21 A.M.Sunset: 4:41 P.M.Moonrise: 3:22 A.M.Moonset: 1:19 P.M.Moon Phase: Waning crescent (17%) Friday, December 27 Sunrise: 7:21 A.M.Sunset: 4:42 P.M.Moonrise: 4:26 A.M.Moonset: 1:50 P.M.Moon Phase: Waning crescent (10%) Saturday, December 28Early risers this morning will be greeted by a beautiful sight in the southeast, as the crescent Moon rises together with the bright red giant Antares and the planet Mercury. At 6 A.M. local time, the trio is 3° high, so you’ll need a clear horizon to spot them. If not, just wait a little while — half an hour later, as the sky is slowly growing light, they’ve reached an altitude of nearly 8°, appearing to stand in a neat horizontal line spanning some 9° from end to end. The Moon is on the right, with Antares close beside it to the left. This magnitude 1.1 star is sometimes occulted by the Moon when conditions are right, but not today. Instead, the Moon will pass 0.09° due south of the star at 10 A.M. EST. Anchoring the left point in the line is Mercury, shining at magnitude –0.3. The Moon will later pass 6° south of Mercury at 11 P.M. EST tonight, when both are hidden from view. By the time this region rises tomorrow morning, the Moon will be positioned directly below Mercury, our satellite showing off an even thinner crescent that rises roughly an hour before the Sun.

EST, when both are below the horizon in Capricornus. Due to the low altitude of this constellation during darkness and the immense faintness of Pluto, the latter will not be visible except to those with very large scopes at southerly declinations. Sunrise: 7:22 A.M.Sunset: 4:46 P.M.Moonrise: 9:05 A.M.Moonset: 6:37 P.M.Moon Phase: Waxing crescent (4%) Thursday, January 2 Sunrise: 7:22 A.M.Sunset: 4:47 P.M.Moonrise: 9:39 A.M.Moonset: 7:51 P.M.Moon Phase: Waxing crescent (9%) Friday, January 3The Moon passes 1.4° south of Venus at 10 A.M. EST. Although neither is visible at that time, you can spot them in the evening sky, now 3.4° apart and 30° high in the south at sunset. The crescent Moon sits to the upper right of blazing Venus, creating a stunning scene that will last: The pair will dominate the early-evening hours, finally setting in the west some four hours after sunset. Sunrise: 7:22 A.M.Sunset: 4:47 P.M.Moonrise: 10:07 A.M.Moonset: 9:03 P.M.Moon Phase: Waxing crescent (17%) The phases of the Moon are: New Moon, waxing crescent, First Quarter, waxing gibbous, Full Moon, waning gibbous, Last Quarter, and waning crescent. A cycle starting from one Full Moon to its next counterpart, termed the synodic month or lunar month, lasts about 29.5 days. Though a Full Moon only occurs during the exact moment when Earth, Moon, and Sun form a perfect alignment, to our eyes, the Moon seems Full for around three days. RELATED: 20 things to see on the Moon There are a wide variety of specialized names used to identify distinct types or timings of Full Moons. These names primarily trace back to a blend of cultural, agricultural, and natural observations about the Moon, aimed at allowing humans to not only predict seasonal changes, but also track the passage of time. For instance, almost every month’s Full Moon boasts a name sourced from Native American, Colonial American, or other North American traditions, with their titles mirroring seasonal shifts and nature’s events. Wolf Moon (January): Inspired by the cries of hungry wolves. Snow Moon (February): A nod to the month’s often heavy snowfall. Worm Moon (March): Named after the earthworms that signal thawing grounds. Pink Moon (April): In honor of the blossoming pink wildflowers. Flower Moon (May): Celebrating the bloom of flowers. Strawberry Moon (June): Marks the prime strawberry harvest season. Buck Moon (July): Recognizing the new antlers on bucks. Sturgeon Moon (August): Named after the abundant sturgeon fish. Corn Moon (September): Signifying the corn harvesting period. Hunter’s Moon (October): Commemorating the hunting season preceding winter. Beaver Moon (November): Reflects the time when beavers are busy building their winter dams. Cold Moon (December): Evocative of winter’s chill. In addition, there are a few additional names for Full Moons that commonly make their way into public conversations and news. Super Moon: This term is reserved for a Full Moon that aligns with the lunar perigee, which is the Moon’s nearest point to Earth in its orbit. This proximity renders the Full Moon unusually large and luminous. For a Full Moon to earn the Super Moon tag, it should be within approximately 90 percent of its closest distance to Earth. Blue Moon: A Blue Moon is the second Full Moon in a month that experiences two Full Moons. This phenomenon graces our skies roughly every 2.7 years. Though the term suggests a color, Blue Moons aren’t truly blue. Very occasionally, atmospheric conditions such as recent volcanic eruptions might lend the Moon a slightly blueish tint, but this hue isn’t tied to the term. Harvest Moon: Occurring closest to the autumnal equinox, typically in September, the Harvest Moon is often renowned for a distinct orange tint it might display. This Full Moon rises close to sunset and sets near sunrise, providing extended hours of bright moonlight. Historically, this was invaluable to farmers gathering their produce. What is the difference between a Full Moon and a New Moon? A Full Moon is witnessed when Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, making the entire Moon’s face visible. Conversely, during a New Moon, the Moon lies between Earth and the Sun, shrouding its Earth-facing side in darkness. How does the Full Moon influence tides? The Moon’s gravitational tug causes Earth’s waters to bulge, birthing tides. During both Full and New Moons, the Sun, Earth, and Moon are in alignment, generating “spring tides.” These tides can swing exceptionally high or low due to the combined gravitational influences of the Sun and Moon.

Learn why the full Cold Moon (also called the Long Night Moon) is special and when the best times for viewing it are. The full Moon for December is 100% illuminated on December 15, 4:02 A.M. (EST). To find the exact time it will appear in your area, consult our Moon Rise Calculator. The moon names we use in The Old Farmer’s Almanac come from Native Americans, Colonial Americans, or other traditional sources passed down through generations. Different Native American peoples traditionally used the monthly Moons and nature’s corresponding signs as a calendar to track the seasons. December’s full Moon is most commonly known as the Cold Moon—a Mohawk name that conveys the frigid conditions of this time of year when cold weather truly begins to grip us. This full Moon has also been called the Long Night Moon (Mohican), as it rises during the “longest” nights of the year, near the December winter solstice. This name is doubly fitting because December’s full Moon shines above the horizon for a more extended period than most full Moons. Other names that allude to the cold and snow include Drift Clearing Moon (Cree), Frost Exploding Trees Moon (Cree), Moon of the Popping Trees (Oglala), Hoar Frost Moon (Cree), Snow Moon (Haida, Cherokee), and Winter Maker Moon (Western Abenaki). Other names include Moon When the Deer Shed Their Antlers (Dakota) and Little Spirit Moon (Anishinaabe). In Europe, ancient pagans called the December full Moon the “Moon Before Yule” in honor of the Yuletide festival celebrating the return of the sun heralded by the winter solstice. → See a full calendar year of full Moon names and their meanings.

Our Full Moon Calendar here lists all the full Moon dates, times, and names for this year and next. Please share your photos in the comments! (See today’s Moon phase.) December’s full Moon is called the “Cold Moon,” due to long nights and low temperatures. But there are many alternative names. Ancient Druids called it the “Oak Moon,” related to harvesting mistletoe from oak trees when the berries are their fullest. Read this article Full Moon Horoscopes Note: Times listed are Eastern Standard (or Eastern Daylight when appropriate). A full Moon is the phase when the Moon appears to be fully illuminated from Earth’s perspective. This occurs when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are all in alignment, forming a straight line. The Moon and The Sun are on exact opposite sides of the Earth. From this position, the Sun’s light shines directly onto the portion of the Moon that is visible to us and creates a full, bright circle of light. This phase comes about 15 days after the New Moon at the approximate midpoint of the lunar cycle (29.5 days). Technically, it is only considered “full” on one specific day. Before and after that, it is either waxing or waning, respectively—no matter how full it appears to be. If you want to get even more technical, it is only “full” for a brief instant. These are the times listed in our calendars. Learn more about the lunar phases. Full Moon names have their roots in the traditions of North American Native American tribes. These tribes honored the changing seasons by assigning unique names to each one. Interestingly, these captivating names encapsulated the essence of a whole month in which they appeared. While there might have been some variations in the names from tribe to tribe, a strong sense of consistency resonated among the different regions. On this rich cultural backdrop, European settlers arrived and embraced the custom, weaving in some of their own versions into the tapestry of time. A Supermoon occurs when the Moon is at least 90% of the way to its perigee position at the same time it is in its “full” or “new” phase. An extreme perigean Supermoon is when a new or full Moon happens at the same time as perigee. Can you have two full Moons in a month? Yes, when that happens, the second one is referred to as a “blue.” (Though it is not blue in color!) On average, this happens every two to three years. As mentioned above, even though the Moon may look full to you a few days before or after the exact time we list above, the Moon is only considered to be full for a brief instant. This peak illumination may occur during the day in some parts of the world. Learn more about this phenomenon. While there’s no real consensus on how Moons affect our moods and physical well-being, there are plenty of studies and real-life experiences that blame it for everything from increased crime and injuries to lack of sleep. What do you believe? (Share your experience in the comments below.) People often find when they align their energies with the specific lunar phases, they feel more inspired and productive. Tuning into nature and the environment around us has been shown to help us understand ourselves on a deeper level. This is why many people engage in monthly routines for self-care to get in alignment with the cycles of nature in order to gain perspective and reconnect with themselves. The phases of the Moon can and do influence fish activity. Similar to deer, fish are most active during the days leading up to and following a full or new Moon. These periods can be particularly fruitful if moonrise or moonset align with sunrise or sunset. Saltwater fish are particularly susceptible to the lunar phases, which cause unusually high and low tides. Higher tides may lure fish into new hunting areas, mainly if they coincide with the spawning of prey fish that can be easily traced. Conversely, lower tides might concentrate fish in locations not frequented during average water levels. While full Moons often garner the most attention, the other lunar phases are equally intriguing. How familiar are you with all the phases? Can you identify the one that remains invisible to us? Or distinguish between waxing and waning? Do you have a favorite name from our Full Moon Calendar here? What are some things you do to celebrate the Moon?

I need a kind, and nice, and calm human to help me. I believe that I am Instinctually synchronising with the moon. It is 6:24 am, and I have to stop. 🛑 Just need to know is the moon right now a new moon? 🌑 October 2 was the Hunter’s New Moon. We hope you are able to find sleep. Yes, I am a nurse and can attest to the full moon effects on our health and behaviors. I’m sure my nursing colleagues out there will agree with me. 🌝 Hi Pt. Pleasant Beach N.J. September 13, 2024 at 7:30 A.M. Sun rising through the clouds and to the right ? Interesting Last year, my 68-year-old partner was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease also known as ALS. Speaking and swallowing were two of his challenges. His collapse was swift and catastrophic, and neither the riluzole nor the medical staff did much to aid him. He would not have survived if our primary care physician hadn’t given him attentive care and attention, as the hospital center didn’t provide any psychological support. His fall was abrupt and catastrophic. His hands and legs gave way to weakness in his arms. This year our family physician suggested using vinehealthcentre. com ALS/MND treatment, which my husband has been receiving for a few months now. I’m delighted to say that the treatment greatly reduced and reversed his symptoms of ALS, he no longer requires a feeding tube, sleeps soundly, works out frequently, and is now very active. In the hopes that it could be useful, I thought I would relate my husband’s tale; in the end, you have to do what suits you the best. I do love full moons , even though I find I get very restless. Can’t sleep .sometimes I can get moody depending on the phase of the moon I do love full moons. I seem to be drawn to them. Although I’m very restless and can’t sleep when there is a full moon. I think it depends as well which moon phase it is, I can also get a bit moody nice I think aliens exist I have recently began a journey of self discovery and am researching many natural phenomena,that I believe have an impact on us all.If moon phases effect other life on earth then surely it effects humans too.

It makes you wonder if somebody planned it that way, because the odds are astronomical that it would be that way Isn’t it amazing that when there is a full eclipse, the shadow of the Earth is exactly the size of the Moon, and fits into it perfectly !?!?! It makes you wonder if somebody planned it that way, because the odds are astronomical that it would be that way. Do you think someone was trying to tell us something ??? Not only that, but when meteors hit the moon, it vibrates like it was hollow, like a bell. If there was air in space for the sound to travel thru, it actually would sound like a ringing bell. I’m 76 and my mother said that when I was a baby, they noticed that around 3 to 4 days before the Full Moon I could not sleep until about 5 in the morning. I’m still like that to this day,I find that I have so much energy and always clean cabinets or closets.😊 I too am the same way!!! I can’t fall asleep on a full moon, i have stayed up the whole night into the day. And wouldn’t be tired! I’d get this urge to clean!

                "title": "Cooper Kupp - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Cooper Douglas Kupp (born June 15, 1993) is an American professional football wide receiver for the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Eastern Washington, where he won the Walter Payton Award as a junior, and was selected by the Rams in the third round of the 2017 NFL draft. Kupp had a breakout season in 2021 when he became the fourth player since the AFL-NFL Merger to lead the league in receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns. Kupp received the Offensive Player of the Year Award and was the MVP of Super Bowl LVI; Jerry Rice is the only other wide receiver to accomplish those feats in a career. Kupp is the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision career leader in receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns. He also holds the NFL record for most receiving yards in a combined season and postseason, posting 2,425 yards in the 2021 season. Kupp was born in Yakima, Washington. He is the grandson of Jake Kupp, an NFL offensive lineman, and the son of Craig Kupp, an NFL quarterback. His family is one of only five in NFL history to have three generations selected in the NFL draft.[1][2] Kupp attended and graduated from Davis High School in Yakima in 2012 where he was a two-sport athlete in football and basketball for the Pirates athletic teams.[3] A two-way All-State selection, he earned first-team 4A All-State honors as a defensive back and honorable mention accolades as a wide receiver from the Associated Press, as selected by sportswriters and broadcasters. Kupp was also named by the Seattle Times as a \"White Chip\" selection, as one of the top 100 prospects in the state of Washington.[4] Kupp was a unanimous first-team All-Columbia Basin Big Nine League wide receiver and defensive back at Davis. He finished his senior season with 60 receptions for 1,059 yards (17.7 per catch) and 18 touchdowns and scored 22 total touchdowns to set a school record. Kupp also had 11 rushes for 122 yards and two touchdowns as he helped Davis come one game away from a berth in the Washington State 4A Playoffs.[4] Kupp finished his prep career without a single college football scholarship offer[5] despite recording 110 catches for 2,100 yards.[4] Three weeks after the final game of his senior season, he received his first scholarship offer to play for Eastern Washington, followed shortly thereafter by an offer from Idaho State.[5] Kupp was also a three-year letter-winner in basketball. He led Davis to a 23–2 record and won the State 4A Tournament championship during his senior year for the Pirates.[4] Kupp attended Eastern Washington University, where he signed to play for coach Beau Baldwin's Eastern Washington Eagles football team in 2012 and redshirted that year. Kupp would eventually be named Eastern's Offensive Scout Team Player of the Year.[4] In 2013, Kupp entered his redshirt freshman year as a starter at wide receiver. He finished the season having set numerous single-season school and national receiving records at the Football Championship Subdivision Level. Kupp has set national freshman records for receiving yards (1,691), total touchdown catches (21), consecutive games with a touchdown catch (14), and receptions (93).[6][7] On November 26, 2013, Kupp was named to the All-Big Sky Conference First-team as a unanimous selection and was also the recipient of the conference's first-ever Freshman of the Year Award.[8] On December 16, 2013, Kupp was named the recipient of the 2013 Jerry Rice Award, given to the top freshman player in the FCS. Kupp is the first Eastern Washington player and the first player from the Big Sky Conference to receive the award.[9] Kupp was named a consensus first-team All-American, having been honored by the four major selectors at the FCS level, consisting of the American Football Coaches Association,[10] the Associated Press,[11] The Sports Network[12] and the Walter Camp Football Foundation.[13] Kupp was the first freshman wide receiver to be named as a first-team All-American since Randy Moss in 1996.[12] On January 9, 2014, Kupp was honored by the College Football Performance Awards with the 2013 FCS Wide Receiver Award. Kupp is the second straight Eagles wide receiver to win the award, following Brandon Kaufman, who won the 2012 award.[14] Kupp finished his sophomore season with 104 catches for 1,431 yards and 16 touchdowns in 13 games.[15] He was named a First-team All-American by the AFCA, AP, and TSN for the second consecutive season. He was also named to the first-team All-Big Sky for the second straight year as a wide receiver while also earning third-team honors as punt returner. Kupp finished 18th in the 2014 Walter Payton Award voting.[16] In the 2015 season, Kupp finished the season with 114 catches for 1,642 yards and 19 touchdowns in 11 games.[17] He broke the Big Sky single-season record for catches with 114, a total that ranks ninth most all-time in FCS single-season history. Kupp was named a first-team All-Big Sky wide receiver for the third-straight year and was also named the league's Offensive Most Valuable Player. He was just the second wide receiver to be named Big Sky Offensive MVP in the last 42 years. Kupp also won the Walter Payton Award, becoming the third Eastern Washington player to win the award and only the second wide receiver to win, after Brian Finneran of Villanova in 1997.[18] On November 30, 2015, Kupp announced that he would return for his senior season after speculation that he was considering entering the 2016 NFL draft.[19] He was poised to break nearly every major FCS career receiving record mark during his final collegiate season. In the 2016 season, Kupp finished with 117 receptions for 1,700 yards and 17 touchdowns.[20] At the end of his college career, Kupp's 428 receptions and 6,464 yards were both the most in FCS history, passing marks previously held by Terrell Hudgins, who had 395 receptions and 5,250 yards playing for Elon University from 2006 to 2009. Moreover, Kupp's 6,464 yards eclipsed Scott Pingel's all-division NCAA record set in 1999, which was accomplished at the Division III level of competition.[21] Kupp's 73 receiving touchdowns also rank first in FCS history, passing the 58 touchdowns that New Hampshire's David Ball caught from 2003 to 2006.[22] Kupp attended the 2017 Senior Bowl and made two receptions for 14 yards for the North, who lost 16–15 to the South.[36] Kupp's performance at the Senior Bowl elevated his draft stock.[37] NFL analyst Bucky Brooks stated Kupp was the top performer at the Senior Bowl. He attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis and completed all the combine drills except for the bench press. On March 28, 2017, Kupp opted to participate in Eastern Washington's pro day along with Jordan West, Shaq Hill, Samson Ebukam, Kendrick Bourne, and Miquiyah Zamora.[38] He attempted all of the combine drills but opted to skip the bench press and broad jump. Kupp shortened his time in the short shuttle to 6.53s and performed positional drills for scouts and team representatives. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Kupp was projected to be a second or third-round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts.[39] He was ranked the eighth-best wide receiver in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com. Steve Smith Sr. ranked him as the best wide receiver in the draft class.[40] The Los Angeles Rams selected Kupp in the third round (69th overall) of the 2017 NFL draft.[43] He was the seventh wide receiver drafted in 2017 and became the second highest pick in Eastern Washington's school history, only behind Michael Roos who was taken by the Tennessee Titans in the 2005 NFL draft (second round, 41st overall).[44][45] Kupp was reunited with Eastern Washington teammate Samson Ebukam after the Rams selected him in the fourth round (125th overall).[46] On June 9, 2017, the Rams signed Kupp to a four-year, $3.83 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $954,760.[47][48][49] Kupp competed with Tavon Austin, Robert Woods, Mike Thomas, Bradley Marquez, Pharoh Cooper, and Josh Reynolds throughout training camp for a starting wide receiver role left vacant after Kenny Britt departed in free agency.[50] Head coach Sean McVay named Kupp the fourth wide receiver on the depth chart behind Watkins, Woods, and Austin.[51] Kupp made his NFL debut in the season-opening 46–9 victory over the Indianapolis Colts and recorded four receptions for 76 yards, including an 18-yard touchdown pass from Jared Goff, marking the first of his career.[52] Three weeks later, Kupp had five catches for 60 yards and a touchdown in a 35–30 road victory over the Dallas Cowboys.[53] During a Week 7 33–0 shutout victory in London against the Arizona Cardinals, he caught four passes for 51 yards and a touchdown.[54] Through the first seven games of the season, Kupp led the Rams in red-zone targets with 11 and developed as Goff's top receiver in the red zone and third downs. Kupp was fourth in the entire NFL in red zone targets behind leaders Davante Adams, Larry Fitzgerald, and Dez Bryant who were tied with 20 red zone targets each.[55] During a Week 9 51–17 victory over the New York Giants, Kupp made his first career NFL start, catching three passes for 54 yards.[56] Three weeks later against the New Orleans Saints, Kupp posted his first career game with over 100 yards, where he finished with 116 as the Rams won 26–20.[57] During a Week 14 43–35 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, he finished with five receptions for 118 yards and a touchdown.[58] By December, Kupp was a full-time starter at wide receiver and ended his rookie season in 2017 with 62 receptions for 869 yards and five touchdowns in 15 games and six starts.[59] The Rams finished atop the NFC West with an 11–5 record.[60] On January 6, 2018, Kupp appeared in his first career playoff game and had eight receptions for 69 yards and a touchdown as the Rams lost by a score of 26–13 to the Atlanta Falcons in an National Football Conference (NFC) Wild Card Game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.[61] Following the season, Kupp was also named to the 2017 All-Rookie Team by the Pro Football Writers Association.[62] Kupp was named a starting wide receiver in 2018 alongside Robert Woods and offseason acquisition Brandin Cooks.[63] During a Week 4 38–31 victory over the Minnesota Vikings, Kupp caught nine passes for 162 yards and two touchdowns (all single-game highs), including a career-best 70-yard scoring reception.[64] In the next game against the Denver Broncos, he sustained a knee injury and was carted off the field. Though Kupp returned to the field in the third quarter of the Rams' 23–20 victory, he was pulled out of the lineup and missed the next two games.[65] During the fourth quarter of a Week 10 36–31 victory over the Seattle Seahawks, Kupp went down with a non-contact injury. An MRI the following day confirmed that he tore his ACL, prematurely ending his season.[66][67] Kupp finished the season with 40 receptions for 566 yards and six touchdowns through eight games and starts.[68] Without Kupp, the Rams reached Super Bowl LIII where they lost 13–3 to the New England Patriots.[69] Kupp returned from his injury in time for the Rams' season opener against the Carolina Panthers. Over the first seven games of the season, he had at least 100 yards in four games and scored four total touchdowns.[70] During a 24–10 Week 8 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in London, Kupp caught seven receptions for 220 yards and a touchdown, marking the first time in his NFL career where he had over 200 yards in a single game.[71] Kupp's performance set an NFL record most receiving yards in an international NFL game.[72] From Weeks 13–17, Kupp scored a receiving touchdown in five consecutive games. Kupp finished the 2019 season with 94 receptions for 1,161 yards and 10 touchdowns in 16 games and 14 starts.[70] He led the team in receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns. Kupp and his teammate Robert Woods gave the Rams a 1,000-yard receiving duo.[73] Kupp's ten receiving touchdowns tied with Mark Andrews for the second most in the NFL in 2019.[74] He was ranked 89th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[75] After wearing number 18 for his first three seasons in the NFL, Kupp switched jersey numbers to number 10, his collegiate number at Eastern Washington.[76] On September 12, 2020, Kupp signed a three-year, $48 million contract extension with the Rams,[77] including $35.1 million guaranteed.[78] Kupp was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the Rams on December 29, 2020, which forced him out of Week 17.[79] He was activated on January 6, 2021.[80] Kupp played in the Wild Card Round as the Rams defeated the Seahawks on the road by a score of 30–20, but he suffered a knee injury, which kept him out of the Divisional Round to the Green Bay Packers, which the Rams lost on the road by a score of 32–18.[81] Kupp finished the 2020 season with 92 receptions for 974 yards and three touchdowns in 15 games and 12 starts. He recorded three games with at least 100 yards.[82] Kupp led the team in receptions and receiving yards for the season.[83] Kupp's performance throughout the 2021 season was one of the greatest statistical receiving seasons in NFL history. With the addition of Matthew Stafford in the offseason, Kupp started the season on a high note.[84] Over the season's first three games, Kupp totaled 25 receptions for 367 yards and five touchdowns in victories for the Rams. Included in that stretch was a season-high 163-yard, two-touchdown performance against the Colts.[85] Kupp was held to season lows in receptions (five) and yardage (64) in the Rams' 37–20 loss to the visiting Cardinals, but he bounced back with seven receptions for 92 yards in a 26–17 road victory over the Seahawks.[86][87] In Weeks 6–7, Kupp had nine receptions for 130 yards and ten receptions for 156 yards while getting two touchdowns in both games against the Giants and Detroit Lions.[88][89] Kupp ended the season with a very productive six-game stretch from Weeks 13–18, averaging 118.3 yards per game and six total touchdowns.[90] In the Rams' 12–5 season, Kupp set numerous franchise single-season receiving records, which resulted in Pro Bowl and First-team All-Pro honors.[91][92][93] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for both September and October.[94][95] Kupp's 145 receptions for 1,947 yards were both franchise records, and his 16 touchdowns finished second to Elroy Hirsch's 17 in 1951.[96] For the 2021 season, Kupp earned the receiving triple crown, becoming the first player since Steve Smith Sr. in 2005 to lead the league in receptions, receiving touchdowns, and receiving yards.[97][98] Kupp's 1,947 yards finished second in NFL history to Calvin Johnson's 1,964 in 2012, while his 145 receptions were second only to Michael Thomas' 149 in 2019.[99] In the Wild Card Round against the Cardinals, Kupp had five receptions for 61 yards and a touchdown in the 34–11 victory.[100] In the Divisional Round, he recorded nine receptions for 183 yards and a touchdown in the narrow 30–27 road victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[101] Kupp had a pivotal 44-yard reception to help set up the Rams' game-winning field goal.[102] In the NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers, he recorded 11 receptions for 142 yards and two touchdowns in the 20–17 victory, bringing the Rams back to the Super Bowl for the second time since 2018.[103] In Super Bowl LVI, against the Bengals, Kupp scored his first career Super Bowl touchdown, an 11-yard reception. In the fourth quarter game-winning drive, Kupp ran for seven yards on a critical 4th-and-1 play, and he and quarterback Matthew Stafford connected on multiple successful catches, including the game-winning touchdown which led to his selection as Super Bowl MVP.[104][105] Kupp's 33 receptions over four playoff games set a new NFL record for a single postseason, while his 478 yards and six touchdowns ranked second in league playoff history behind Cardinals receiver Larry Fitzgerald.[106][107] He was ranked fourth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[108] On June 9, 2022, Kupp signed a three-year, $80.1 million contract extension to remain with the Rams throughout 2026. The contract includes a $20 million signing bonus and $75 million guaranteed.[109] In the NFL Kickoff Game against the Buffalo Bills, Kupp caught 13 passes for 128 yards and a touchdown in the 31–10 loss.[110] In the next game, he had 11 receptions for 108 yards and two touchdowns in the 31–27 victory over the Falcons.[111] Two weeks later, Kupp recorded 14 receptions for 122 yards in a 24–9 road loss to the 49ers.[112] During a Week 5 22–10 loss to the Cowboys, he had seven receptions for 125 yards and a touchdown.[113] During a Week 10 27–17 loss to the Cardinals, Kupp suffered a high ankle sprain, which required surgery.[114] He was placed on injured reserve on November 15, 2022.[115] Kupp finished the 2022 season with 75 receptions for 812 yards and six touchdowns in nine games and starts as the Rams finished with a 5–12 record.[116][117] He was ranked 47th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[118] On September 9, 2023, Kupp was placed on injured reserve to begin the season due to a lingering hamstring injury.[119] He was activated off injured reserve on October 7, ahead of the Rams' Week 5 game against the Eagles.[120] In his return against the Eagles, he had eight receptions for 118 yards in the loss.[121] In the following game, a victory over the Cardinals, he had seven receptions for 148 yards and a touchdown.[122] In Week 14, in a close loss to the Ravens, he had eight receptions for 115 yards and a touchdown.[123] In Week 15, a victory over the Commanders, he had eight receptions for 111 yards and a touchdown.[124] In the 2023 season, he started in the 12 regular season games he appeared in.

Two weeks later, Kupp caught six receptions for 106 yards and two TD receptions in a 28-22 win at New England. The pair of scores vaulted Kupp past Hall of Famer Elroy Hirsch to third place for team career receiving TDs behind Bruce (84) and Holt (74). Kupp is the son of former NFL quarterback Craig Kupp, a fifth-round draft pick by the New York Giants in 1990 out of Pacific Lutheran University who played for the Phoenix Cardinals and the Dallas Cowboys in 1991.[138] His younger brother, Ketner, also played at Eastern Washington and was signed by the Los Angeles Rams as a free agent in 2019, participating in training camp and in preseason games, but was released during the final roster cutdown.[139] His grandfather, Jake Kupp, was an offensive lineman for the University of Washington and was selected in the ninth round of the 1964 NFL draft by the Dallas Cowboys. He played from 1964 to 1975 as a guard with Dallas, the Washington Redskins, Atlanta Falcons, and the New Orleans Saints. Named to the NFL All-Rookie team, he later was a five-time captain for the Saints. He was named to the franchise's 25-year All-Time Team and was inducted into the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame in 1991.[138] Kupp developed a close friendship with former Rams quarterback Jared Goff while living with him for a few weeks after the draft. They practiced on their own time together, watched films, studied defensive schemes, and learned the playbook.[140][141] Kupp has been described as a devout Christian.[142][138] As a senior in high school, Kupp met his girlfriend and future wife Anna Croskrey.[143] They got married in June 2015 and have three sons.[144] The family lives in Westlake Village, California during the season and Wilsonville, Oregon during the offseason.[145][146]",

                "content": "News: 14 hours agoKupp failed to bring in any of his three targets in the Rams' 12-6 win over the 49ers on Thursday night. Spin: The wet conditions certainly played a role, but seeing Kupp finish without a catch for the first time since Week 10 of the 2019 season and second time in his career still was shocking, not to mention especially ill-timed from a fantasy perspective. Kupp had entered Thursday with at least 60 receiving yards in five of the previous six games, and he'll naturally have nowhere to go but up in a Week 16 road matchup against the Jets on Sunday, Dec. 22. ESPN Fantasy Projection: It was an up-and-down effort from Kupp in 2023, who missed the first four weeks with a hamstring issue and has now missed 13 games the past two seasons. On the plus side, Kupp posted four 100-yard efforts and five outings of 15 or more fantasy points. Unfortunately, he was also held below 40 yards in six of 12 contests, managing single-digit fantasy points in five of those games. Kupp's nose for the end zone saved fantasy managers, as the 30-year-old scored four times from Weeks 13 through 17. Obviously, Puka Nacua's emergence negatively affected Kupp's volume, though the vet remained Matthew Stafford's favorite high-value target. Kupp led the team in red zone opportunities (19, WR9). While he appears past peak value, Kupp's savvy and chemistry with Stafford are solid enough for him to deliver low-end WR2 numbers in PPR formats.",

                "content": "Senior News Writer Cooper Kupp isn't letting trade chatter bother him as he gets set to return for Thursday's matchup against the Minnesota Vikings. \"It is that time of the year, there's going to be rumors. I let that stuff, as much as I can, be in the background,\" Kupp said on Tuesday, via The Associated Press. Over the weekend, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported that clubs have been calling the Rams inquiring about Kupp. Since then, the rumors have only increased. \"I have a job to do here, and I take a lot of pride in giving everything I can for the guys in this building in being able to step on the field knowing I have prepared the best I can,\" Kupp said. \"And for seven and a half years, I've been an L.A. Ram, and I have taken that approach every single day. Whatever happens outside of that, I got to control what I can control. Right now, that means being the best L.A. Ram I can be.\" Kupp has been out since Week 2 due to an ankle injury. With Puka Nacua returning to practice and the emergence of young receivers like Jordan Whittington, the Rams could sell high on the 2021 Offensive Player of the Year. Quarterback Matthew Stafford, another target of trade rumors, said the speculation doesn't bother veterans like himself or Kupp. \"Obviously, I'm a fan of the league, so you hear those things,\" Stafford said. \"But to be honest, we're pro athletes, professional football players who have kind of dealt with this stuff before, understand it comes with the territory. Don't put much into it because that's a disservice to what we got going on here. We've got a short week and a really good opponent to try to prepare for, so that's our full focus. I know that's where he stays too, so (we) don't worry too much about that stuff.\" In the only game he was healthy, Week 1 in Detroit, Kupp caught 14 of 21 targets for 110 yards and a touchdown. Kupp has missed 17 games in the past two-plus seasons due to injuries. When he's on the field, however, he's been Stafford's security blanket. Kupp has been on the field for 54.5 percent of Stafford dropbacks since 2023, per Next Gen Stats. Stafford's passer rating is nearly 20 points higher with Kupp on the field (98.8) than with him off the field (79.4). The question is whether Thursday's game is the last for the dynamic duo or if the show goes on. NFL.com keeps you up to date with all of the latest league news from around the NFL.

It was the Rams' defense, aided by some splash plays from Puka Nacua and the foot of rookie kicker Joshua Karty, that kept L.A.'s postseason hopes alive with a victory over the 49ers on Thursday night. Saints quarterback Jake Haener will make his first NFL start on Sunday against the Washington Commanders, NFL Network Insider Mike Garafolo reported Thursday night.

                "content": "Stray Kids, Jelly Roll and more acts took the stage. By Hannah Dailey The 2024 Billboard Music Awards presented by Marriott Bonvoy are in the books, with multiple artists taking home awards in between memorable performances from Stray Kids, Jelly Roll and more. Shaboozey was the first star to take the stage at the ceremony Thursday night (Dec. 13) — a fitting kickoff considering his single “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” dominated the Billboard charts this year. The country star got the crowd in a party mood by performing the track — which spent a record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 this year — after which Megan Moroney treated fans to a live rendition of “Man on the Moon” and Tyla brought the heat with “Push 2 Start” and “Shake Ah.” The “Chk Chk Boom!” boy band and SEVENTEEN both brought the house down with high-energy dance numbers, while Teddy Swims, Fuerza Regida and “Son of a Sinner” singer each performed two numbers a piece. Plus, Coldplay tuned in live from their Music of the Spheres Tour, while Linkin Park shredded on “The Emptiness Machine.” Hosted by Michelle Buteau, the 2024 BBMAs aired Thursday on Fox and Fire TV channels, as well as on-demand on Paramount+. Performances are available to watch back on Billboard.com and via @BBMAs and @Billboard social channels. The Billboard Music Awards are produced by Dick Clark Productions, which is owned by Penske Media Corporation. PMC is also the parent company of Billboard.

The BBMAs, which aired Thursday night, highlighted the songs, albums and artists that dominated the charts and filled the airwaves throughout the year. Heading into the ceremony, country rocker Zach Bryan and pop superstar Taylor Swift led the pack with the most nominations. \"The Tortured Poets Department\" singer also faced off once more with rap star Drake to compete for the most all-time BBMA wins; the two tied last year with a career total of 39 awards. Swift emerged victorious on the eve of her 35th birthday, winning 10 shiny new trophies that earned her the status of the BBMAs' most-decorated artist in the show's history. The award show also featured a slew of first-time finalists who received their musical flowers. Pop star Sabrina Carpenter was up for Top Hot 100 Artist and top streaming songs artist, and her viral single \"Espresso\" was up for Top Billboard Global 200 song and Top Billboard global song. Unfortunately, she was beat out in each of the categories. Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle. Other freshman nominees included Teddy Swims, Tyla, Benson Boone, Shaboozey, Junior H, Chappell Roan, Enhypen and The Red Clay Strays. Aside from recognizing the year's winners, the star-studded pre-taped ceremony – hosted by actress and comedian Michelle Buteau (\"Babes,\" \"The Circle\") – also featured performances from Coldplay, country music stars Shaboozey and Megan Moroney, rock band Linkin Park, regional Mexican group Fuerza Regida, country rap star Jelly Roll and K-pop boy band Stray Kids. The eligibility dates for this year's awards corresponded with Billboard's year-end charts tracking period, from Oct. 28, 2023, through Oct. 19, 2024.

                "content": "Gukesh Dommaraju (born 29 May 2006), also known as Gukesh D, is an Indian chess grandmaster and the reigning World Chess Champion. He is the youngest undisputed World Chess Champion in the history of the game.[1] A chess prodigy, Gukesh is the youngest player to have surpassed a FIDE rating of 2750, doing so at the age of 17, and was the third-youngest to have surpassed 2700 at the age of 16. He earned the title of grandmaster at the age of 12 and remains the third-youngest grandmaster in the history of chess.[2] He won a team gold and an individual gold medal at the 45th Chess Olympiad in 2024, as well as a team bronze and an individual gold medal at the 44th Chess Olympiad in 2022. At the age of 18, he became the youngest Candidates Tournament winner and, subsequently, the World Chess Champion by defeating Ding Liren 7½ to 6½ at the World Chess Championship 2024.[3] At the junior level, he is a multiple-gold medalist at the World Youth Championship and the Asian Youth Chess Championship. Gukesh is also a silver medalist at the Asian Games.[4] Gukesh was born on 29 May 2006 in Chennai into a Telugu family from Andhra Pradesh.[5][6][7] His mother, Padma, is a microbiologist while his father, Rajinikanth, is an ENT surgeon.[8] He learned to play chess at the age of seven.[9] He studied at the Velammal Vidyalaya School, in Mel Ayanambakkam, Chennai.[10] Gukesh's family hails from the village of Chenchuraju Kandriga, near Satyavedu in the Tirupati district of Andhra Pradesh.[5][6][7] His grandfather Shankar Raju was born and raised in Chenchuraju Kandriga and worked in the Indian Railways. His son Rajinikanth, later settled in Chennai to pursue a medical career and married Padmavathi there.[6][5] The family owns properties in Chenchuraju Kandriga, where Shankar Raju is currently settled.[5][11] Gukesh embarked on his chess journey in 2013, starting with structured one-hour sessions held three times a week. From 2017 to 2018, his mother became the sole breadwinner after his father quit his job to travel with Gukesh for various tournaments. Inasmuch as the family faced financial struggles, Gukesh was sponsored by his parents' friends during the time.[12] His extraordinary talent having been being recognized institutionally early on, he has been the beneficiary of the robust Indian chess ecosystem, perhaps the best in the world, from his schooldays onwards.[13] Gukesh won the Under-9 section of the Asian School Chess Championships in 2015[14] and the World Youth Chess Championships in 2018 in the Under 12 category.[15] He also won five gold medals at the 2018 Asian Youth Chess Championships in the U-12 individual rapid and blitz, U-12 team rapid and blitz and U-12 individual classical formats.[16] He completed the requirements for the title of International Master in March 2017 at the 34th Cappelle-la-Grande Open.[17] On 15 January 2019, at the age of 12 years, 7 months, and 17 days, Gukesh became the then second-youngest grandmaster in history,[18] only surpassed by Sergey Karjakin by 17 days.[19] The record has since been beaten by Abhimanyu Mishra, making Gukesh the third-youngest.[20][21] In June 2021, he won the Julius Baer Challengers Chess Tour, Gelfand Challenge, scoring 14 out of 19 points.[22] In August 2022, he played the 44th Chess Olympiad and initially had a perfect score of 8/8, notably defeating US No. 1 Fabiano Caruana in the eighth match.[23] He finished with a score of 9 out of 11, earning the gold medal on the 1st board and his team India-2 finished third in the tournament. In September 2022, Gukesh reached a rating of over 2700 for the first time, with a rating of 2726.[24] This made him the third-youngest player to pass 2700, after Wei Yi and Alireza Firouzja.[25] In October 2022 during the Aimchess Rapid tournament, Gukesh became the youngest player to beat Magnus Carlsen since the latter became World Champion.[26] In the August 2023 rating list, Gukesh became the youngest player ever to reach a rating of 2750.[27] Gukesh participated in the Chess World Cup 2023. He defeated Misratdin Iskandarov, S. L. Narayanan, Andrey Esipenko, and Wang Hao to qualify for the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen.[28] In the September 2023 rating list, Gukesh officially surpassed Viswanathan Anand as the top-ranked Indian player, marking the first time in 37 years that Anand was not the top-ranked Indian player.[29][30] In December 2023, with the end of the FIDE Circuit, Gukesh qualified for the 2024 Candidates Tournament.[31] Gukesh had placed second in the Circuit, but Fabiano Caruana, the winner, had already qualified through the World Cup.[32] He became the third youngest player to qualify for a Candidates tournament, behind Bobby Fischer and Magnus Carlsen.[33][34] In January 2024, Gukesh participated in the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2024. He scored 8.5/13 to finish in a 4-way tie for first place. In the twelfth round, he had a winning position against R Praggnanandhaa but blundered into a threefold repetition. In tiebreaks, he defeated Anish Giri in the semifinals but lost to Wei Yi in the finals.[35] In April 2024, Gukesh participated in the 2024 Candidates Tournament (the WACA livery on his blazer standing for WestBridge-Ananad Chess Academy).[36][37][38] Gukesh won games against R Praggnanandhaa and Vidit Gujrathi playing as black, Alireza Firouzja playing as white, and Nijat Abasov playing as both black and white.[39] His only loss was his game with black against Firouzja. This gave him five wins, one loss and eight draws, for a score of 9/14, winning the tournament and qualifying for the 2024 World Championship match against Ding Liren.[40] He is the youngest-ever winner of the Candidates.[41][42][43] In September 2024, Gukesh took part in the Chess Olympiad in Budapest as part of the Indian team. He showcased a dominant performance on board one, scoring an unbeaten 9 points in the 10 games he played. In the tournament, he defeated grandmasters Vignir Vatnar Stefansson, Ádám Kozák, Alexandr Predke, Aydin Suleymanli, Wei Yi, Parham Maghsoodloo, Fabiano Caruana, and Vladimir Fedoseev. He had a performance rating of 3056, which was the highest among all players in the tournament. His performance earned him an individual gold medal on board one, and helped India to their first ever team gold medal at the Olympiad.[44] Gukesh entered the FIDE world top-five for the first time on 1 October 2024.[45][46] Gukesh became the 18th World Chess Champion on 12 December 2024 after defeating Ding Liren in the last game and winning the World Chess Championship by 7.5–6.5.[47] The win made him the youngest undisputed World Chess Champion,[48] a notable feat for which he received accolades within and without the chess world.[49] FIDE characterized most of the gameplay as having \"near-perfect accuracy\", and Ding averred that it was his best game of the year, and that he had no regrets.[50]",

                "content": "Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Stanley, the drinkware brand that exploded in popularity on social media, issued a recall of roughly 2.6 million travel mugs over potential “burn hazards,” the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced in a release Thursday. The recall applies specifically to all Stanely Switchback and Trigger Action stainless steel travel mugs sold in the United States, the commission said, which have polypropylene lids that were found to loosen once exposed to “heat and torque,” therefore posing a burn risk. The tumblers range from 12 to 20 ounces and come in a variety of different colors including white, black and green, the agency said. Stanley received more than 90 reports worldwide over problems relating to the detached lids – 38 of those complaints were tied to burn injuries, with 11 of those requiring medical attention. Sixteen of the complaints and two of the injury reports were in the US. “Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled travel mugs and contact Stanley to receive a free replacement lid, including shipping,” the commission said. Related article The Stanley craze begs the question: Why do we love our special little cups so much? The drinkware brand posted instructions on how to identify models and replace lids on a recall website. The mugs, which cost between $20 and $50 depending on the model, were sold at retailers like Amazon, Target, Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods. CNN has reached out to these companies, along with Stanley, for comment on the nationwide recall. Though Stanley has been around for more than a century, the company went through a brand revamp in 2020, with the goal of attracting women as a potential new consumer base. The company soon launched new drinkware in a limitless array of colors and designs and relied on trusted influencers on social media to get the word out. The network of trust and recommendation creates buzz, Charles Lindsey, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Buffalo School of Management, told CNN. “People see people whose tastes they trust trying something new, and that item becomes a symbol of social status and being ‘in the know.’” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

The most recent winner is former LSU Tigers quarterback Jayden Daniels.[1] The award was created by the Downtown Athletic Club to recognize \"the most valuable college football player east of the Mississippi\" and was first awarded to University of Chicago halfback Jay Berwanger.[2][3] The award was given its name in 1936 after the death of the club's athletic director John Heisman and broadened to include players west of the Mississippi.[4][5] USC has the most Heisman trophies won with eight; Ohio State, Oklahoma, and Notre Dame each have seven; Ohio State has had six different players win the award. The closest margin of votes was in 2009 between winner Mark Ingram II of Alabama and Toby Gerhart of Stanford.[6] Ten Heisman Trophy winners are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame,[7][8] and four winners have also been named Most Valuable Player in a Super Bowl. Some winners have gone on to play in other professional sports, including Bo Jackson in baseball and Charlie Ward in basketball. Pete Dawkins and Dick Kazmaier are the only winners not to pursue a professional sports career: Dawkins had a career with the United States Army, where he achieved the rank of Brigadier General, while Kazmaier attended Harvard Business School, founded a consulting company specializing in sports marketing, and chaired the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition in 1988–89. The trophy itself, designed by sculptor Frank Eliscu, is modeled after Ed Smith, a leading player in 1934 for the now-defunct New York University football team.[9][10] The trophy is made out of cast bronze, is 13.5 inches (34 cm) tall, 14 inches (36 cm) long, 16 inches (41 cm) in width and weighs 45 pounds (20 kg).[11] Eliscu had asked Smith, his former George Washington High School classmate, to pose for a commissioned sculpture of a football player. Smith did not realize until 1982 that the sculpture had become the Heisman Trophy. The Downtown Athletic Club presented Smith with a Heisman Trophy of his own in 1985.[12] From its inception in 1935, the statue was cast by Dieges & Clust in New York (and later Providence, Rhode Island) until 1980, when Dieges and Clust was sold to Herff Jones.[13] For a time until at least 2008, the statues were cast by Roman Bronze Works in New York.[14] Since 2005 the trophy has been made by MTM Recognition in Del City, Oklahoma.[15] Originally only players east of the Mississippi were eligible, but since 1936 all football players playing in all divisions of college football nationwide are eligible for the award, though winners usually represent Division I Football Bowl Subdivision schools.[16] There are three categories of eligible voters for the award winner: Except for the one vote based on the fan voting, the balloting is based on positional voting, whereby each voter identifies three selections, ranking them in order. Each first-place selection is awarded three points, each second-place selection is awarded two points, and each third-place selection is awarded one point. Voters must make three selections and cannot duplicate a selection, else the ballot is invalid and none of the selections count.[17] The accounting firm Deloitte is responsible for the tabulation of votes, which has moved almost exclusively to online voting since 2007.[17] The Heisman has usually been awarded either to a running back or a quarterback; very few players have won the trophy playing a position other than those two. Three wide receivers have been named winner: Tim Brown (1987), Desmond Howard (1991), and DeVonta Smith (2020). Two tight ends have also won the trophy, Larry Kelley (1936) and Leon Hart (1949). Charles Woodson is the only primarily defensive player to win the award, doing so as a defensive back, while also serving as kick returner and occasional wide receiver for Michigan in 1997. The highest finish ever for any individual who played exclusively on defense is second, by defensive end Hugh Green of Pittsburgh in 1980, linebacker Manti Te'o of Notre Dame in 2012, and by defensive end Aidan Hutchinson of Michigan in 2021. Although John Heisman himself was an interior lineman, no interior lineman on either side of the ball has ever won the award. Legendary linebacker Dick Butkus placed sixth in 1963 and third in 1964 and could qualify as an interior lineman, as he played center on offense during his era when two-way players were still common. Offensive guard Tom Brown of Minnesota and the offensive tackle John Hicks of Ohio State placed second in 1960 and 1973, respectively. Rich Glover, a defensive lineman from Nebraska, finished 3rd in the 1972 vote—which was won by his Cornhusker teammate Johnny Rodgers. Washington's DT Steve Emtman finished 4th in voting in 1991. Ndamukong Suh of Nebraska finished fourth in 2009 as a defensive tackle. Also, Kurt Burris, a center for the Oklahoma team, was a runner-up for the award in 1954 and Orlando Pace finished fourth in 1996 as an offensive tackle for Ohio State.[citation needed] For most of its history, most winners of the Heisman have been seniors.[18] Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel was the first freshman to win the Heisman in 2012. The following year, freshman Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston also won the Heisman. Both, however, were in their second year of college, having been redshirted during their first year of attendance, meaning that no true freshman has yet won the award. No sophomore won the Heisman in its first 72 years, at which point there were three consecutive sophomore winners—Tim Tebow in 2007, followed by Sam Bradford and Mark Ingram II—with Lamar Jackson, who also surpassed Winston's record as the youngest Heisman winner, becoming the fourth in 2016. Of the four sophomores to have won the award, only Bradford had been redshirted; the others all won during their second year of college attendance. Only a few juniors have won the award, starting with the eleventh winner in 1945, Doc Blanchard. Five players have finished in the top three of the Heisman voting as freshmen or sophomores before later winning the award: Angelo Bertelli, Glenn Davis, Doc Blanchard, Doak Walker, and Herschel Walker. Eight players have finished in the top three as freshmen or sophomores but never won a Heisman: Clint Castleberry, Marshall Faulk, Michael Vick, Rex Grossman, Larry Fitzgerald, Adrian Peterson, Deshaun Watson, and Christian McCaffrey. Four players have specifically finished second in consecutive years: Glenn Davis (second in 1944 and 1945, winner in 1946), Charlie Justice (second 1948 and 1949), Darren McFadden (second 2006 and 2007), and Andrew Luck (second 2010 and 2011). The oldest and youngest Heisman winners ever both played for Atlantic Coast Conference schools. The oldest, Chris Weinke, was 28 years old when he won in 2000; he spent six years in minor league baseball before enrolling at Florida State. The youngest winner is 2016 recipient Lamar Jackson of Louisville at the age of 19 years, 338 days, four days younger than Jameis Winston was when he won in 2013. The award was first presented in 1935 by the Downtown Athletic Club (DAC) in New York City, a privately owned recreation facility located on the lower west side near the later World Trade Center site. It was first known simply as the DAC Trophy. The first winner, Jay Berwanger, was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles but declined to sign for them. He never played professional football for any team. In 1936, John Heisman died and the trophy was renamed in his honor.[19] Larry Kelley, the second winner of the award, was the first man to win it as the \"Heisman Trophy\".[20] The first African American player to win the Heisman was Syracuse's Ernie Davis, who never played a snap in the NFL. He was diagnosed with leukemia shortly after winning the award and died in 1963. In 1966, former Florida Gators quarterback Steve Spurrier gave his Heisman trophy to the university president, Dr. J. Wayne Reitz, so that the award could be shared by Florida students and faculty.[9] The gesture caused Florida's student government to raise funds to purchase a replacement trophy for Spurrier.[9] Since then, the Downtown Athletic Club has issued two trophies to winners, one to the individual and a replica to his college.[9] Several Heisman trophies have been sold over the years; although there is a ban on the sale of all trophies awarded since 1999, trophies awarded in previous years can be sold.[21] O. J. Simpson's 1968 trophy was sold in February 1999 for $230,000 as part of the settlement of the civil trial following the acquittal in his murder case.[9] Yale end Larry Kelley sold his 1936 Heisman in December 1999 for $328,110 to settle his estate and to provide a bequest for his family.[9] Charles White's 1979 trophy first sold for $184,000 and then for nearly $300,000 in December 2006 to help pay back federal income taxes.[9] The current record price for a Heisman belongs to the trophy won by Minnesota halfback Bruce Smith in 1941 at $395,240.[9] Paul Hornung sold his Heisman for $250,000 to endow scholarships for University of Notre Dame students from his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky.[9] Eliscu's original plaster cast sold at Sotheby's for $228,000 in December 2005.[9] Due to the neighborhood housing the Downtown Athletic Club's facilities becoming blockaded after the attacks on 9/11, the 2001 award ceremony was moved to the New York Marriott Marquis in Times Square. After the DAC filed for bankruptcy in 2002, the Yale Club hosted the presentation at its facility in 2002 and 2003. The ceremony moved to the Hilton New York for 2004, and was presented annually at Palladium Times Square (then Nokia Theatre Times Square) from 2005 until its closure in 2019 (except in 2017, when the presentation was moved back to the Marquis because of a scheduling conflict).[22][23] The 2008 Heisman press conference was held at the Sports Museum of America at 26 Broadway near the old Downtown Club building. There was an entire gallery with the museum-attraction dedicated to the Trophy, including the making of the Trophy, the history of the DAC, and information on John Heisman and all the Trophy's winners. There was also a dedicated area celebrating the most recent winner, and the opportunity for visitors to cast their vote for the next winner (with the top vote-winner receiving 1 official vote on their behalf).[24] The Sports Museum of America closed permanently in February 2009.[25] After Palladium Times Square (then PlayStation Theater) closed in December 2019, the Heisman Trust began searching for a new location to conduct the trophy presentation. The 2020 ceremony would ultimately be held at the studios of ESPN in Bristol, Connecticut due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the ceremony was a virtual event with all participants appearing via remote interviews.[26] The 2021 ceremony returned to an in-person event, with the presentation held at The Appel Room at Jazz at Lincoln Center.[27] WOR-TV broadcast the 1949 ceremonies.[28] Before 1977, the presentation of the award was not televised as a stand-alone special, but rather as a quick in-game feature. The ceremony usually aired on ABC as a feature at halftime of the last major national telecast (generally a rivalry game) of the college football season. ABC essentially showed highlights since the award was handed out as part of an annual weeknight dinner at the DAC. At the time, the event had usually been scheduled for the week following the Army–Navy Game.[citation needed] The most watched Heisman ceremony ever was in 2009 when Mark Ingram won over Toby Gerhart and Colt McCoy.[29] Broadcasters include:[citation needed] A number of critics have expressed concern about the unwritten rules regarding player position and age, as noted above.[citation needed] Over the years, there has been substantial criticism of a regional bias, suggesting that the Heisman balloting process has ignored West Coast players.[30] At present, the Pac-12 Conference (formerly Pac-10 and Pac-8) represents 2 of the 65 teams in the Power Five conferences. The Heisman can be, and has been, presented to players from other conferences, but a random sample over a long period of time might suggest that Pac-10/12 players might win somewhere close to 18% of the Heisman awards.[31] In the 20 seasons between 1981 (Marcus Allen) and 2002 (Carson Palmer), not a single Pacific-10 Conference or other West Coast player won the Heisman Trophy. Four Southern California (USC) players have won the Trophy in the early years of the 21st century and three won it subsequent to Palmer. Although Terry Baker, quarterback from Oregon State, won the trophy in 1962, and Gary Beban from UCLA won in 1967, no non-USC player from the West Coast had won between Stanford's Jim Plunkett in 1970 and Oregon's Marcus Mariota in 2014. Other than Mariota's win, the closest since Plunkett's win have been Chuck Muncie, John Elway, Toby Gerhart, Andrew Luck, Christian McCaffrey, and Bryce Love. Muncie was a running back for the California Golden Bears who finished second in the Heisman balloting in 1975. The other five were Stanford players who finished second in the Heisman balloting in 1982, and each year from 2009 to 2011, 2015, and 2017. The West Coast bias discussion usually centers on the idea that East Coast voters see few West Coast games, because of television coverage contracts, time zone differences, or cultural interest. At Heisman-projection website StiffArmTrophy.com, commentator Kari Chisholm claims that the Heisman balloting process itself is inherently biased: For Heisman voting purposes, the nation is divided into six regions—each of which get 145 votes. Put another way, each region gets exactly 16.67 percent of the votes. However, each region does not constitute an even one-sixth of the population. Three regions (Far West, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic) have larger populations than 16.67% of the national population; and three have less (Northeast, South, and Southwest). In fact, the Far West has the greatest population at 21.2% of the country and the Northeast has the least at 11.9%.[32] In 2010 University of Southern California athletic director Pat Haden announced the university would return its replica of the 2005 Heisman Trophy due to NCAA sanctions requiring the university to dissociate itself from Reggie Bush. The NCAA found that Bush had received gifts from an agent while at USC. On September 14, 2010, Bush voluntarily forfeited his title as a Heisman winner. The next day, the Heisman Trust announced the 2005 award would remain vacated and removed all mention of the 2005 award from its official website.[33] Bush eventually returned the trophy itself to the Heisman Trust in 2012.[34] Critical responses from the national media were strident and varied. CBSSports.com producer J. Darin Darst opined that Bush \"should never have been pressured to return the award.\" Kalani Simpson of Fox Sports wrote, \"Nice try Heisman Trust...It's a slick move to try to wipe the slate clean.\" Former Football Writers Association of America president Dennis Dodd, on the other hand, decided to fictitiously award Bush's vacated 2005 award to Vince Young, the original runner-up that year. He wrote, \"Since the Heisman folks won't re-vote, we did. Vince Young is the new winner of the 2005 Heisman.\" A Los Angeles Times piece argued that Bush's Heisman was \"tainted,\" but lamented that the decision came five years after Bush was awarded the trophy and, therefore, four years after the expiration of Bush's term as current holder of the Heisman title.[35][36][37][38] On April 24, 2024, the Heisman Trust announced the formal reinstatement of Reggie Bush's trophy amid what it called \"enormous changes in the college football landscape\". The Trust cited \"fundamental changes in college athletics\" in which rules that have allowed student athlete compensation to become an accepted practice and the 2021 United States Supreme Court decision against the NCAA in the Alston case, which the Trust said \"questioned the legality of the NCAA's amateurism model and opened the door to student athlete compensation\". This decision did not affect USC's vacated titles and records from their 2004 and 2005 season which was also caused by the scandal and they are still have their 2004 championship vacated with an official record of 11-0 and also have all their results vacated for the 2005 season and have an official record of 0-0.[39]",

                "content": "The most prestigious award in college football. John W. Heisman: Innovator of the Game As the tradition of the Heisman Memorial Trophy grows with each passing year, the life of the man memorialized by the award fades into the annals of history. No one more thoroughly studied the dynamics of football or witnessed more closely the game’s evolution. No one personally knew more immortals of the gridiron or effected more change in the game’s development, than John W. Heisman. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, October 23, 1869, John William Heisman grew up on the oil fields of northwest Pennsylvania, in the town of Titusville. John Heisman’s first football games were a hodgepodge of soccer and rugby. In 1887, at age 17 he left Titusville for Brown University where he played a form of club football with his classmates. After two years, in the fall of 1889, he transferred to The University of Pennsylvania to pursue a law degree. Though outsized at 5’8” and 158lbs, he played varsity football for three years as guard, center, tackle, and sometimes end. A Coaching Career Debilitated after a flash of lightning nearly cost him his eyesight, Heisman took his final exams orally and graduated with his law degree in the spring of 1892. Immediately after college, he got his first coaching job at Oberlin College, leading the team to win all of its seven games in only the second year of the football program. Heisman’s career was launched. His career as a coach developed with stints at Auburn, Clemson, University of Pennsylvania, Washington & Jefferson and Rice. His most impressive coaching reign was with Georgia Tech (1904-1919), where his Golden Tornadoes were a scoring powerhouse with an astounding 33 straight wins. Coach Heisman left Georgia Tech after the 1919 season to return as head coach at his alma mater, University of Pennsylvania. After three years he bought out his contract and spent one year at Washington & Jefferson before moving west to Texas and Rice Institute. His coaching career ultimately spanned more than three decades, and in 1927 at age 62, John W. Heisman retired from coaching the game he loved and developed. “Retirement” In New York, John Heisman found more time to write as well as to serve in advisory positions. His articles appeared in publications such as American Liberty and Colliers Magazine, and he also served as football editor for the professional publication Sporting Goods Journal. This prodigious outpouring did not go unnoticed. On May 23, 1930, John W. Heisman was named the first Athletic Director of the Downtown Athletic Club of New York City. Serving in this capacity, Heisman organized and founded the Touchdown Club of New York, and later the National Football Coaches Association. At the insistence of the DAC officers, Heisman organized and set in motion the structure and voting system to determine the best collegiate football player in the country. Though initially opposed to pointing out an individual over a team, he ultimately felt it a consummate team accomplishment to have such recognition. The first Downtown Athletic Club Award was given in 1935 to Chicago’s Jay Berwanger. On October 3, 1936, before the second award was bestowed, John W. Heisman succumbed to pneumonia. The officers of the DAC unanimously voted to rename the DAC Award the Heisman Memorial Trophy that year. A Life Achievement During his coaching career, Heisman changed the face of the game that became America’s passion. What he considered his greatest contribution, the forward pass, was legalized in 1906, after three years of writing and pestering Walter Camp and the rules committee. Much of the official rule book of the day adopted Heisman’s suggestions word for word. Men who respected and called John W. Heisman friend included coaches Robert C. Zuppke of Illinois, Fielding Yost of Michigan, Amos A. Stagg of Chicago, Dr. J.W. Wilce of the Ohio State University, D.X. Bible of Texas A&M; legendary sports writer Grantland Rice; golf’s first Grand Slam winner Robert Jones Jr.; and former teammate and Honorable Mayor of Philadelphia Harry A Mackey. As did his life touch many, the spirit of his character continues to inspire the best in those who would receive his Memorial.
